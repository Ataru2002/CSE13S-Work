========================================

TAMBURLAINE THE GREAT,

IN TWO PARTS.

This is Part I.

By Christopher Marlowe

Edited By The Rev. Alexander Dyce.


TRANSCRIBER'S COMMENTS ON THE PREPARATION OF THE E-TEXT:


SQUARE BRACKETS:

The square brackets, i.e. [ ] are copied from the printed book,
without change, except that the stage directions usually do not
have closing brackets.  These have been added.


FOOTNOTES:

For this E-Text version of the book, the footnotes have been
consolidated at the end of the play.

Numbering of the footnotes has been changed, and each footnote
is given a unique identity in the form [XXX].


CHANGES TO THE TEXT:

Character names were expanded.  For Example, TAMBURLAINE was
TAMB., ZENOCRATE was ZENO., etc.


GREEK:
One word, appearing in note 115, was printed in Greek Characters.
This word has been transliterated as <<deiktikos>>.



  Tamburlaine the Great.  Who, from a Scythian Shephearde
  by his rare and woonderfull Conquests, became a most
  puissant and mightye Monarque.  And (for his tyranny,
  and terrour in Warre) was tearmed, The Scourge of God.
  Deuided into two Tragicall Discourses, as they were
  sundrie times shewed vpon Stages in the Citie of London.
  By the right honorable the Lord Admyrall, his seruauntes.
  Now first, and newlie published.  London.  Printed by
  Richard Ihones:  at the signe of the Rose and Crowne
  neere Holborne Bridge.  1590.  4to.

The above title-page is pasted into a copy of the FIRST PART OF
TAMBURLAINE in the Library at Bridge-water House; which copy,
excepting that title-page and the Address to the Readers, is the
impression of 1605.  I once supposed that the title-pages which
bear the dates 1605 and 1606 (see below) had been added to the
4tos of the TWO PARTS of the play originally printed in 1590;
but I am now convinced that both PARTS were really reprinted,
THE FIRST PART in 1605, and THE SECOND PART in 1606, and that
nothing remains of the earlier 4tos, except the title-page and
the Address to the Readers, which are preserved in the Bridge-
water collection.

In the Bodleian Library, Oxford, is an 8vo edition of both PARTS
OF TAMBURLAINE, dated 1590:  the title-page of THE FIRST PART
agrees verbatim with that given above; the half-title-page of
THE SECOND PART is as follows;

  The Second Part of The bloody Conquests of mighty
  Tamburlaine.  With his impassionate fury, for the death
  of his Lady and loue faire Zenocrate; his fourme of
  exhortacion and discipline to his three sons, and the
  maner of his own death.

In the Garrick Collection, British Museum, is an 8vo edition of
both PARTS dated 1592:  the title-page of THE FIRST PART runs
thus;

  Tamburlaine the Great.  Who, from a Scythian Shepheard,
  by his rare and wonderfull Conquestes, became a most
  puissant and mightie Mornarch [sic]:  And (for his
  tyrannie, and terrour in warre) was tearmed, The Scourge
  of God.  The first part of the two Tragicall discourses,
  as they were sundrie times most stately shewed vpon
  Stages in the Citie of London.  By the right honorable
  the Lord Admirall, his seruauntes.  Now newly published.
  Printed by Richard Iones, dwelling at the signe of the
  Rose and Crowne neere Holborne Bridge.

The half-title-page of THE SECOND PART agrees exactly with that
already given.  Perhaps the 8vo at Oxford and that in the British
Museum (for I have not had an opportunity of comparing them) are
the same impression, differing only in the title-pages.

Langbaine (ACCOUNT OF ENGL. DRAM. POETS, p. 344) mentions an 8vo
dated 1593.

The title-pages of the latest impressions of THE TWO PARTS are
as follows;

  Tamburlaine the Greate.  Who, from the state of a
  Shepheard in Scythia, by his rare and wonderfull
  Conquests, became a most puissant and mighty Monarque.
  London Printed for Edward White, and are to be solde
  at the little North doore of Saint Paules-Church, at
  the signe of the Gunne, 1605.  4to.

  Tamburlaine the Greate.  With his impassionate furie,
  for the death of his Lady and Loue fair Zenocrate:  his
  forme of exhortation and discipline to his three Sonnes,
  and the manner of his owne death.  The second part.
  London Printed by E. A. for Ed. White, and are to be
  solde at his Shop neere the little North doore of Saint
  Paules Church at the Signe of the Gun.  1606.  4to.

The text of the present edition is given from the 8vo of 1592,
collated with the 4tos of 1605-6.




TO THE GENTLEMEN-READERS [1] AND OTHERS THAT TAKE PLEASURE
IN READING HISTORIES. [2]

Gentlemen and courteous readers whosoever:  I have here published
in print, for your sakes, the two tragical discourses of the
Scythian shepherd Tamburlaine, that became so great a conqueror
and so mighty a monarch.  My hope is, that they will be now no
less acceptable unto you to read after your serious affairs and
studies than they have been lately delightful for many of you to
see when the same were shewed in London upon stages.  I have
purposely omitted and left out some fond [3] and frivolous
gestures,
digressing, and, in my poor opinion, far unmeet for the matter,
which I thought might seem more tedious unto the wise than any
way else to be regarded, though haply they have been of some
vain-conceited fondlings greatly gaped at, what time they were
shewed upon the stage in their graced deformities:  nevertheless
now to be mixtured in print with such matter of worth, it would
prove a great disgrace to so honourable and stately a history.
Great folly were it in me to commend unto your wisdoms either the
eloquence of the author that writ them or the worthiness of the
matter itself.  I therefore leave unto your learned censures [4]
both the one and the other, and myself the poor printer of them
unto your most courteous and favourable protection; which if you
vouchsafe to accept, you shall evermore bind me to employ what
travail and service I can to the advancing and pleasuring of your
excellent degree.
     Yours, most humble at commandment,
          R[ichard] J[ones], printer.



THE FIRST PART OF TAMBURLAINE THE GREAT.




THE PROLOGUE.

      From jigging veins of rhyming mother-wits,
      And such conceits as clownage keeps in pay,
      We'll lead you to the stately tent of war,
      Where you shall hear the Scythian Tamburlaine
      Threatening the world with high astounding terms,
      And scourging kingdoms with his conquering sword.
      View but his picture in this tragic glass,
      And then applaud his fortunes as you please.

THE FIRST PART OF TAMBURLAINE THE GREAT.




ACT I.




SCENE I.

          Enter MYCETES, COSROE, MEANDER, THERIDAMAS, ORTYGIUS,
          CENEUS, MENAPHON, with others.

     MYCETES. Brother Cosroe, I find myself agriev'd;
     Yet insufficient to express the same,
     For it requires a great and thundering speech:
     Good brother, tell the cause unto my lords;
     I know you have a better wit than I.

     COSROE. Unhappy Persia,--that in former age
     Hast been the seat of mighty conquerors,
     That, in their prowess and their policies,
     Have triumph'd over Afric, [5] and the bounds
     Of Europe where the sun dares scarce appear
     For freezing meteors and congealed cold,--
     Now to be rul'd and govern'd by a man
     At whose birth-day Cynthia with Saturn join'd,
     And Jove, the Sun, and Mercury denied
     To shed their [6] influence in his fickle brain!
     Now Turks and Tartars shake their swords at thee,
     Meaning to mangle all thy provinces.

     MYCETES. Brother, I see your meaning well enough,
     And through [7] your planets I perceive you think
     I am not wise enough to be a king:
     But I refer me to my noblemen,
     That know my wit, and can be witnesses.
     I might command you to be slain for this,--
     Meander, might I not?

     MEANDER. Not for so small a fault, my sovereign lord.

     MYCETES. I mean it not, but yet I know I might.--
     Yet live; yea, live; Mycetes wills it so.--
     Meander, thou, my faithful counsellor,
     Declare the cause of my conceived grief,
     Which is, God knows, about that Tamburlaine,
     That, like a fox in midst of harvest-time,
     Doth prey upon my flocks of passengers;
     And, as I hear, doth mean to pull my plumes:
     Therefore 'tis good and meet for to be wise.

     MEANDER. Oft have I heard your majesty complain
     Of Tamburlaine, that sturdy Scythian thief,
     That robs your merchants of Persepolis
     Trading by land unto the Western Isles,
     And in your confines with his lawless train
     Daily commits incivil [8] outrages,
     Hoping (misled by dreaming prophecies)
     To reign in Asia, and with barbarous arms
     To make himself the monarch of the East:
     But, ere he march in Asia, or display
     His vagrant ensign in the Persian fields,
     Your grace hath taken order by Theridamas,
     Charg'd with a thousand horse, to apprehend
     And bring him captive to your highness' throne.

     MYCETES. Full true thou speak'st, and like thyself, my lord,
     Whom I may term a Damon for thy love:
     Therefore 'tis best, if so it like you all,
     To send my thousand horse incontinent [9]
     To apprehend that paltry Scythian.
     How like you this, my honourable lords?
     Is it not a kingly resolution?

     COSROE. It cannot choose, because it comes from you.

     MYCETES. Then hear thy charge, valiant Theridamas,
     The chiefest [10] captain of Mycetes' host,
     The hope of Persia, and the very legs
     Whereon our state doth lean as on a staff,
     That holds us up and foils our neighbour foes:
     Thou shalt be leader of this thousand horse,
     Whose foaming gall with rage and high disdain
     Have sworn the death of wicked Tamburlaine.
     Go frowning forth; but come thou smiling home,
     As did Sir Paris with the Grecian dame:
     Return with speed; time passeth swift away;
     Our life is frail, and we may die to-day.

     THERIDAMAS. Before the moon renew her borrow'd light,
     Doubt not, my lord and gracious sovereign,
     But Tamburlaine and that Tartarian rout [11]
     Shall either perish by our warlike hands,
     Or plead for mercy at your highness' feet.

     MYCETES. Go, stout Theridamas; thy words are swords,
     And with thy looks thou conquerest all thy foes.
     I long to see thee back return from thence,
     That I may view these milk-white steeds of mine
     All loaden with the heads of killed men,
     And, from their knees even to their hoofs below,
     Besmear'd with blood that makes a dainty show.

     THERIDAMAS. Then now, my lord, I humbly take my leave.

     MYCETES. Theridamas, farewell ten thousand times.

          [Exit THERIDAMAS.]

     Ah, Menaphon, why stay'st thou thus behind,
     When other men press [12] forward for renown?
     Go, Menaphon, go into Scythia,
     And foot by foot follow Theridamas.

     COSROE. Nay, pray you, [13] let him stay; a greater [task]
     Fits Menaphon than warring with a thief:
     Create him pro-rex of all [14] Africa,
     That he may win the Babylonians' hearts,
     Which will revolt from Persian government,
     Unless they have a wiser king than you.

     MYCETES. Unless they have a wiser king than you!
     These are his words; Meander, set them down.

     COSROE. And add this to them,--that all Asia
     Lament to see the folly of their king.

     MYCETES. Well, here I swear by this my royal seat--

     COSROE. You may do well to kiss it, then.

     MYCETES. Emboss'd with silk as best beseems my state,
     To be reveng'd for these contemptuous words!
     O, where is duty and allegiance now?
     Fled to the Caspian or the Ocean main?
     What shall I call thee? brother? no, a foe;
     Monster of nature, shame unto thy stock,
     That dar'st presume thy sovereign for to mock!--
     Meander, come:  I am abus'd, Meander.

          [Exeunt all except COSROE and MENAPHON.]

     MENAPHON. How now, my lord! what, mated [15] and amaz'd
     To hear the king thus threaten like himself!

     COSROE. Ah, Menaphon, I pass not [16] for his threats!
     The plot is laid by Persian noblemen
     And captains of the Median garrisons
     To crown me emperor of Asia:
     But this it is that doth excruciate
     The very substance of my vexed soul,
     To see our neighbours, that were wont to quake
     And tremble at the Persian monarch's name,
     Now sit and laugh our regiment [17] to scorn;
     And that which might resolve [18] me into tears,
     Men from the farthest equinoctial line
     Have swarm'd in troops into the Eastern India,
     Lading their ships [19] with gold and precious stones,
     And made their spoils from all our provinces.

     MENAPHON. This should entreat your highness to rejoice,
     Since Fortune gives you opportunity
     To gain the title of a conqueror
     By curing of this maimed empery.
     Afric and Europe bordering on your land,
     And continent to your dominions,
     How easily may you, with a mighty host,
     Pass [20] into Graecia, as did Cyrus once,
     And cause them to withdraw their forces home,
     Lest you [21] subdue the pride of Christendom!

          [Trumpet within.]

     COSROE. But, Menaphon, what means this trumpet's sound?

     MENAPHON. Behold, my lord, Ortygius and the rest
     Bringing the crown to make you emperor!

          Re-enter ORTYGIUS and CENEUS, [22] with others, bearing a
          crown.

     ORTYGIUS. Magnificent and mighty prince Cosroe,
     We, in the name of other Persian states [23]
     And commons of this mighty monarchy,
     Present thee with th' imperial diadem.

     CENEUS. The warlike soldiers and the gentlemen,
     That heretofore have fill'd Persepolis
     With Afric captains taken in the field,
     Whose ransom made them march in coats of gold,
     With costly jewels hanging at their ears,
     And shining stones upon their lofty crests,
     Now living idle in the walled towns,
     Wanting both pay and martial discipline,
     Begin in troops to threaten civil war,
     And openly exclaim against their [24] king:
     Therefore, to stay all sudden mutinies,
     We will invest your highness emperor;
     Whereat the soldiers will conceive more joy
     Than did the Macedonians at the spoil
     Of great Darius and his wealthy host.

     COSROE. Well, since I see the state of Persia droop
     And languish in my brother's government,
     I willingly receive th' imperial crown,
     And vow to wear it for my country's good,
     In spite of them shall malice my estate.

     ORTYGIUS. And, in assurance of desir'd success,
     We here do crown thee monarch of the East [;]
     Emperor of Asia and Persia; [25]
     Great lord of Media and Armenia;
     Duke of Africa and Albania,
     Mesopotamia and of Parthia,
     East India and the late-discover'd isles;
     Chief lord of all the wide vast Euxine Sea,
     And of the ever-raging [26] Caspian Lake.

     ALL. [27] Long live Cosroe, mighty emperor!

     COSROE. And Jove may [28] never let me longer live
     Than I may seek to gratify your love,
     And cause the soldiers that thus honour me
     To triumph over many provinces!
     By whose desires of discipline in arms
     I doubt not shortly but to reign sole king,
     And with the army of Theridamas
     (Whither we presently will fly, my lords,)
     To rest secure against my brother's force.

     ORTYGIUS. We knew, [29] my lord, before we brought the crown,
     Intending your investion so near
     The residence of your despised brother,
     The lords [30] would not be too exasperate
     To injury [31] or suppress your worthy title;
     Or, if they would, there are in readiness
     Ten thousand horse to carry you from hence,
     In spite of all suspected enemies.

     COSROE. I know it well, my lord, and thank you all.

     ORTYGIUS. Sound up the trumpets, then.

          [Trumpets sounded.]

     ALL. [32] God save the king!

          [Exeunt.]




SCENE II.

          Enter TAMBURLAINE leading ZENOCRATE, TECHELLES, USUMCASANE,
          AGYDAS, MAGNETES, LORDS, and SOLDIERS loaden with treasure.

     TAMBURLAINE. Come, lady, let not this appal your thoughts;
     The jewels and the treasure we have ta'en
     Shall be reserv'd, and you in better state
     Than if you were arriv'd in Syria,
     Even in the circle of your father's arms,
     The mighty Soldan of Aegyptia.

     ZENOCRATE. Ah, shepherd, pity my distressed plight!
     (If, as thou seem'st, thou art so mean a man,)
     And seek not to enrich thy followers
     By lawless rapine from a silly maid,
     Who, travelling [33] with these Median lords
     To Memphis, from my uncle's country of Media,
     Where, all my youth, I have been governed,
     Have pass'd the army of the mighty Turk,
     Bearing his privy-signet and his hand
     To safe-conduct us thorough [34] Africa.

     MAGNETES. And, since we have arriv'd in Scythia,
     Besides rich presents from the puissant Cham,
     We have his highness' letters to command
     Aid and assistance, if we stand in need.

     TAMBURLAINE. But now you see these letters and commands
     Are countermanded by a greater man;
     And through my provinces you must expect
     Letters of conduct from my mightiness,
     If you intend to keep your treasure safe.
     But, since I love to live at liberty,
     As easily may you get the Soldan's crown
     As any prizes out of my precinct;
     For they are friends that help to wean my state
     Till men and kingdoms help to strengthen it,
     And must maintain my life exempt from servitude.--
     But, tell me, madam, is your grace betroth'd?

     ZENOCRATE. I am, my lord,--for so you do import.

     TAMBURLAINE. I am a lord, for so my deeds shall prove;
     And yet a shepherd by my parentage.
     But, lady, this fair face and heavenly hue
     Must grace his bed that conquers Asia,
     And means to be a terror to the world,
     Measuring the limits of his empery
     By east and west, as Phoebus doth his course.--
     Lie here, ye weeds, that I disdain to wear!
     This complete armour and this curtle-axe
     Are adjuncts more beseeming Tamburlaine.--
     And, madam, whatsoever you esteem
     Of this success, and loss unvalued, [35]
     Both may invest you empress of the East;
     And these that seem but silly country swains
     May have the leading of so great an host
     As with their weight shall make the mountains quake,
     Even as when windy exhalations,
     Fighting for passage, tilt within the earth.

     TECHELLES. As princely lions, when they rouse themselves,
     Stretching their paws, and threatening herds of beasts,
     So in his armour looketh Tamburlaine.
     Methinks I see kings kneeling at his feet,
     And he with frowning brows and fiery looks
     Spurning their crowns from off their captive heads.

     USUMCASANE. And making thee and me, Techelles, kings,
     That even to death will follow Tamburlaine.

     TAMBURLAINE. Nobly resolv'd, sweet friends and followers!
     These lords perhaps do scorn our estimates,
     And think we prattle with distemper'd spirits:
     But, since they measure our deserts so mean,
     That in conceit [36] bear empires on our spears,
     Affecting thoughts coequal with the clouds,
     They shall be kept our forced followers
     Till with their eyes they view us emperors.

     ZENOCRATE. The gods, defenders of the innocent.
     Will never prosper your intended drifts,
     That thus oppress poor friendless passengers.
     Therefore at least admit us liberty,
     Even as thou hop'st to be eternized
     By living Asia's mighty emperor.

     AGYDAS. I hope our lady's treasure and our own
     May serve for ransom to our liberties:
     Return our mules and empty camels back,
     That we may travel into Syria,
     Where her betrothed lord, Alcidamus,
     Expects the arrival of her highness' person.

     MAGNETES. And wheresoever we repose ourselves,
     We will report but well of Tamburlaine.

     TAMBURLAINE. Disdains Zenocrate to live with me?
     Or you, my lords, to be my followers?
     Think you I weigh this treasure more than you?
     Not all the gold in India's wealthy arms
     Shall buy the meanest soldier in my train.
     Zenocrate, lovelier than the love of Jove,
     Brighter than is the silver Rhodope, [37]
     Fairer than whitest snow on Scythian hills,
     Thy person is more worth to Tamburlaine
     Than the possession of the Persian crown,
     Which gracious stars have promis'd at my birth.
     A hundred Tartars shall attend on thee,
     Mounted on steeds swifter than Pegasus;
     Thy garments shall be made of Median silk,
     Enchas'd with precious jewels of mine own,
     More rich and valurous [38] than Zenocrate's;
     With milk-white harts upon an ivory sled
     Thou shalt be drawn amidst the frozen pools, [39]
     And scale the icy mountains' lofty tops,
     Which with thy beauty will be soon resolv'd: [40]
     My martial prizes, with five hundred men,
     Won on the fifty-headed Volga's waves,
     Shall we all offer [41] to Zenocrate,
     And then myself to fair Zenocrate.

     TECHELLES. What now! in love?

     TAMBURLAINE. Techelles, women must be flattered:
     But this is she with whom I am in [42] love.

          Enter a SOLDIER.

     SOLDIER. News, news!

     TAMBURLAINE. How now! what's the matter?

     SOLDIER. A thousand Persian horsemen are at hand,
     Sent from the king to overcome us all.

     TAMBURLAINE. How now, my lords of Egypt, and Zenocrate!
     Now must your jewels be restor'd again,
     And I, that triumph'd [43] so, be overcome?
     How say you, lordings? is not this your hope?

     AGYDAS. We hope yourself will willingly restore them.

     TAMBURLAINE. Such hope, such fortune, have the thousand horse.
     Soft ye, my lords, and sweet Zenocrate!
     You must be forced from me ere you go.--
     A thousand horsemen! we five hundred foot!
     An odds too great for us to stand against.
     But are they rich? and is their armour good!

     SOLDIER. Their plumed helms are wrought with beaten gold,
     Their swords enamell'd, and about their necks
     Hang massy chains of gold down to the waist;
     In every part exceeding brave [44] and rich.

     TAMBURLAINE. Then shall we fight courageously with them?
     Or look you I should play the orator?

     TECHELLES. No; cowards and faint-hearted runaways
     Look for orations when the foe is near:
     Our swords shall play the orators for us.

     USUMCASANE. Come, let us meet them at the mountain-top, [45]
     And with a sudden and an hot alarum
     Drive all their horses headlong down the hill.

     TECHELLES. Come, let us march.

     TAMBURLAINE. Stay, Techelles; ask a parle first.

          The SOLDIERS enter.

     Open the mails, [46] yet guard the treasure sure:
     Lay out our golden wedges to the view,
     That their reflections may amaze the Persians;
     And look we friendly on them when they come:
     But, if they offer word or violence,
     We'll fight, five hundred men-at-arms to one,
     Before we part with our possession;
     And 'gainst the general we will lift our swords,
     And either lance [47] his greedy thirsting throat,
     Or take him prisoner, and his chain shall serve
     For manacles till he be ransom'd home.

     TECHELLES. I hear them come:  shall we encounter them?

     TAMBURLAINE. Keep all your standings, and not stir a foot:
     Myself will bide the danger of the brunt.

          Enter THERIDAMAS with others.

     THERIDAMAS. Where is this [48] Scythian Tamburlaine?

     TAMBURLAINE. Whom seek'st thou, Persian?  I am Tamburlaine.

     THERIDAMAS. Tamburlaine!
     A Scythian shepherd so embellished
     With nature's pride and richest furniture!
     His looks do menace heaven and dare the gods;
     His fiery eyes are fix'd upon the earth,
     As if he now devis'd some stratagem,
     Or meant to pierce Avernus' darksome vaults [49]
     To pull the triple-headed dog from hell.

     TAMBURLAINE. Noble and mild this Persian seems to be,
     If outward habit judge the inward man.

     TECHELLES. His deep affections make him passionate.

     TAMBURLAINE. With what a majesty he rears his looks!--
     In thee, thou valiant man of Persia,
     I see the folly of thy [50] emperor.
     Art thou but captain of a thousand horse,
     That by characters graven in thy brows,
     And by thy martial face and stout aspect,
     Deserv'st to have the leading of an host?
     Forsake thy king, and do but join with me,
     And we will triumph over all the world:
     I hold the Fates bound fast in iron chains,
     And with my hand turn Fortune's wheel about;
     And sooner shall the sun fall from his sphere
     Than Tamburlaine be slain or overcome.
     Draw forth thy sword, thou mighty man-at-arms,
     Intending but to raze my charmed skin,
     And Jove himself will stretch his hand from heaven
     To ward the blow, and shield me safe from harm.
     See, how he rains down heaps of gold in showers,
     As if he meant to give my soldiers pay!
     And, as a sure and grounded argument
     That I shall be the monarch of the East,
     He sends this Soldan's daughter rich and brave, [51]
     To be my queen and portly emperess.
     If thou wilt stay with me, renowmed [52] man,
     And lead thy thousand horse with my conduct,
     Besides thy share of this Egyptian prize,
     Those thousand horse shall sweat with martial spoil
     Of conquer'd kingdoms and of cities sack'd:
     Both we will walk upon the lofty cliffs; [53]
     And Christian merchants, [54] that with Russian stems [55]
     Plough up huge furrows in the Caspian Sea,
     Shall vail [56] to us as lords of all the lake;
     Both we will reign as consuls of the earth,
     And mighty kings shall be our senators.
     Jove sometime masked in a shepherd's weed;
     And by those steps that he hath scal'd the heavens
     May we become immortal like the gods.
     Join with me now in this my mean estate,
     (I call it mean, because, being yet obscure,
     The nations far-remov'd admire me not,)
     And when my name and honour shall be spread
     As far as Boreas claps his brazen wings,
     Or fair Bootes [57] sends his cheerful light,
     Then shalt thou be competitor [58] with me,
     And sit with Tamburlaine in all his majesty.

     THERIDAMAS. Not Hermes, prolocutor to the gods,
     Could use persuasions more pathetical.

     TAMBURLAINE. Nor are Apollo's oracles more true
     Than thou shalt find my vaunts substantial.

     TECHELLES. We are his friends; and, if the Persian king
     Should offer present dukedoms to our state,
     We think it loss to make exchange for that
     We are assur'd of by our friend's success.

     USUMCASANE. And kingdoms at the least we all expect,
     Besides the honour in assured conquests,
     Where kings shall crouch unto our conquering swords,
     And hosts of soldiers stand amaz'd at us,
     When with their fearful tongues they shall confess,
     These are the men that all the world admires.

     THERIDAMAS. What strong enchantments tice my yielding soul
     To these [59] resolved, noble Scythians!
     But shall I prove a traitor to my king?

     TAMBURLAINE. No; but the trusty friend of Tamburlaine.

     THERIDAMAS. Won with thy words, and conquer'd with thy looks,
     I yield myself, my men, and horse to thee,
     To be partaker of thy good or ill,
     As long as life maintains Theridamas.

     TAMBURLAINE. Theridamas, my friend, take here my hand,
     Which is as much as if I swore by heaven,
     And call'd the gods to witness of my vow.
     Thus shall my heart be still combin'd with thine
     Until our bodies turn to elements,
     And both our souls aspire celestial thrones.--
     Techelles and Casane, welcome him.

     TECHELLES. Welcome, renowmed [60] Persian, to us all!

     USUMCASANE. Long may Theridamas remain with us!

     TAMBURLAINE. These are my friends, in whom I more rejoice
     Than doth the king of Persia in his crown;
     And, by the love of Pylades and Orestes,
     Whose statues [61] we adore in Scythia,
     Thyself and them shall never part from me
     Before I crown you kings [62] in Asia.
     Make much of them, gentle Theridamas,
     And they will never leave thee till the death.

     THERIDAMAS. Nor thee nor them, [63] thrice-noble Tamburlaine,
     Shall want my heart to be with gladness pierc'd,
     To do you honour and security.

     TAMBURLAINE. A thousand thanks, worthy Theridamas.--
     And now, fair madam, and my noble lords,
     If you will [64] willingly remain with me,
     You shall have honours as your merits be;
     Or else you shall be forc'd with slavery.

     AGYDAS. We yield unto thee, happy Tamburlaine.

     TAMBURLAINE. For you, then, madam, I am out of doubt.

     ZENOCRATE. I must be pleas'd perforce,--wretched Zenocrate!

          [Exeunt.]




ACT II.




SCENE I.

          Enter COSROE, MENAPHON, ORTYGIUS, and CENEUS, with SOLDIERS.

     COSROE. Thus far are we towards Theridamas,
     And valiant Tamburlaine, the man of fame,
     The man that in the forehead of his fortune
     Bears figures of renown and miracle.
     But tell me, that hast seen him, Menaphon,
     What stature wields he, and what personage?

     MENAPHON. Of stature tall, and straightly fashioned,
     Like his desire, lift upwards and divine;
     So large of limbs, his joints so strongly knit,
     Such breadth of shoulders as might mainly bear
     Old Atlas' burden; 'twixt his manly pitch, [65]
     A pearl more worth than all the world is plac'd,
     Wherein by curious sovereignty of art
     Are fix'd his piercing instruments of sight,
     Whose fiery circles bear encompassed
     A heaven of heavenly bodies in their spheres,
     That guides his steps and actions to the throne
     Where honour sits invested royally;
     Pale of complexion, wrought in him with passion,
     Thirsting with sovereignty and [66] love of arms;
     His lofty brows in folds do figure death,
     And in their smoothness amity and life;
     About them hangs a knot of amber hair,
     Wrapped in curls, as fierce Achilles' was,
     On which the breath of heaven delights to play,
     Making it dance with wanton majesty;
     His arms and fingers long and sinewy, [67]
     Betokening valour and excess of strength;--
     In every part proportion'd like the man
     Should make the world subdu'd [68] to Tamburlaine.

     COSROE. Well hast thou pourtray'd in thy terms of life
     The face and personage of a wondrous man:
     Nature doth strive with Fortune [69] and his stars
     To make him famous in accomplish'd worth;
     And well his merits shew him to be made
     His fortune's master and the king of men,
     That could persuade, at such a sudden pinch,
     With reasons of his valour and his life,
     A thousand sworn and overmatching foes.
     Then, when our powers in points of swords are join'd,
     And clos'd in compass of the killing bullet,
     Though strait the passage and the port [70] be made
     That leads to palace of my brother's life,
     Proud is [71] his fortune if we pierce it not;
     And, when the princely Persian diadem
     Shall overweigh his weary witless head,
     And fall, like mellow'd fruit, with shakes of death,
     In fair [72] Persia noble Tamburlaine
     Shall be my regent, and remain as king.

     ORTYGIUS. In happy hour we have set the crown
     Upon your kingly head, that seeks our honour
     In joining with the man ordain'd by heaven
     To further every action to the best.

     CENEUS. He that with shepherds and a little spoil
     Durst, in disdain of wrong and tyranny,
     Defend his freedom 'gainst a monarchy,
     What will he do supported by a king,
     Leading a troop of gentlemen and lords,
     And stuff'd with treasure for his highest thoughts!

     COSROE. And such shall wait on worthy Tamburlaine.
     Our army will be forty thousand strong,
     When Tamburlaine and brave Theridamas
     Have met us by the river Araris;
     And all conjoin'd to meet the witless king,
     That now is marching near to Parthia,
     And, with unwilling soldiers faintly arm'd,
     To seek revenge on me and Tamburlaine;
     To whom, sweet Menaphon, direct me straight.

     MENAPHON. I will, my lord.

          [Exeunt.]




SCENE II.

          Enter MYCETES, MEANDER, with other LORDS; and SOLDIERS.

     MYCETES. Come, my Meander, let us to this gear.
     I tell you true, my heart is swoln with wrath
     On this same thievish villain Tamburlaine,
     And of [73] that false Cosroe, my traitorous brother.
     Would it not grieve a king to be so abus'd,
     And have a thousand horsemen ta'en away?
     And, which is worse, [74] to have his diadem
     Sought for by such scald knaves as love him not?
     I think it would:  well, then, by heavens I swear,
     Aurora shall not peep out of her doors,
     But I will have Cosroe by the head,
     And kill proud Tamburlaine with point of sword.
     Tell you the rest, Meander:  I have said.

     MEANDER. Then, having pass'd Armenian deserts now,
     And pitch'd our tents under the Georgian hills,
     Whose tops are cover'd with Tartarian thieves,
     That lie in ambush, waiting for a prey,
     What should we do but bid them battle straight,
     And rid the world of those detested troops?
     Lest, if we let them linger here a while,
     They gather strength by power of fresh supplies.
     This country swarms with vile outragious men
     That live by rapine and by lawless spoil,
     Fit soldiers for the [75] wicked Tamburlaine;
     And he that could with gifts and promises
     Inveigle him that led a thousand horse,
     And make him false his faith unto his [76] king,
     Will quickly win such as be [77] like himself.
     Therefore cheer up your minds; prepare to fight:
     He that can take or slaughter Tamburlaine,
     Shall rule the province of Albania;
     Who brings that traitor's head, Theridamas,
     Shall have a government in Media,
     Beside [78] the spoil of him and all his train:
     But, if Cosroe (as our spials say,
     And as we know) remains with Tamburlaine,
     His highness' pleasure is that he should live,
     And be reclaim'd with princely lenity.

          Enter a SPY.

     SPY. An hundred horsemen of my company,
     Scouting abroad upon these champion [79] plains,
     Have view'd the army of the Scythians;
     Which make report it far exceeds the king's.

     MEANDER. Suppose they be in number infinite,
     Yet being void of martial discipline,
     All running headlong, greedy after [80] spoils,
     And more regarding gain than victory,
     Like to the cruel brothers of the earth,
     Sprung [81] of the teeth of [82] dragons venomous,
     Their careless swords shall lance [83] their fellows' throats,
     And make us triumph in their overthrow.

     MYCETES. Was there such brethren, sweet Meander, say,
     That sprung of teeth of dragons venomous?

     MEANDER. So poets say, my lord.

     MYCETES. And 'tis a pretty toy to be a poet.
     Well, well, Meander, thou art deeply read;
     And having thee, I have a jewel sure.
     Go on, my lord, and give your charge, I say;
     Thy wit will make us conquerors to-day.

     MEANDER. Then, noble soldiers, to entrap these thieves
     That live confounded in disorder'd troops,
     If wealth or riches may prevail with them,
     We have our camels laden all with gold,
     Which you that be but common soldiers
     Shall fling in every corner of the field;
     And, while the base-born Tartars take it up,
     You, fighting more for honour than for gold,
     Shall massacre those greedy-minded slaves;
     And, when their scatter'd army is subdu'd,
     And you march on their slaughter'd carcasses,
     Share equally the gold that bought their lives,
     And live like gentlemen in Persia.
     Strike up the [84] drum, and march courageously:
     Fortune herself doth sit upon our crests.

     MYCETES. He tells you true, my masters; so he does.--
     Drums, why sound ye not when Meander speaks?

          [Exeunt, drums sounding.]




SCENE III.

          Enter COSROE, TAMBURLAINE, THERIDAMAS, TECHELLES,
     USUMCASANE,
          and ORTYGIUS, with others.

     COSROE. Now, worthy Tamburlaine, have I repos'd
     In thy approved fortunes all my hope.
     What think'st thou, man, shall come of our attempts?
     For, even as from assured oracle,
     I take thy doom for satisfaction.

     TAMBURLAINE. And so mistake you not a whit, my lord;
     For fates and oracles [of] heaven have sworn
     To royalize the deeds of Tamburlaine,
     And make them blest that share in his attempts:
     And doubt you not but, if you favour me,
     And let my fortunes and my valour sway
     To some [85] direction in your martial deeds,
     The world will [86] strive with hosts of men-at-arms
     To swarm unto the ensign I support.
     The host of Xerxes, which by fame is said
     To drink the mighty Parthian Araris,
     Was but a handful to that we will have:
     Our quivering lances, shaking in the air,
     And bullets, like Jove's dreadful thunderbolts,
     Enroll'd in flames and fiery smouldering mists,
     Shall threat the gods more than Cyclopian wars;
     And with our sun-bright armour, as we march,
     We'll chase the stars from heaven, and dim their eyes
     That stand and muse at our admired arms.

     THERIDAMAS. You see, my lord, what working words he hath;
     But, when you see his actions top [87] his speech,
     Your speech will stay, or so extol his worth
     As I shall be commended and excus'd
     For turning my poor charge to his direction:
     And these his two renowmed [88] friends, my lord,
     Would make one thirst [89] and strive to be retain'd
     In such a great degree of amity.

     TECHELLES. With duty and [90] with amity we yield
     Our utmost service to the fair [91] Cosroe.

     COSROE. Which I esteem as portion of my crown.
     Usumcasane and Techelles both,
     When she [92] that rules in Rhamnus' [93] golden gates,
     And makes a passage for all prosperous arms,
     Shall make me solely emperor of Asia,
     Then shall your meeds [94] and valours be advanc'd
     To rooms of honour and nobility.

     TAMBURLAINE. Then haste, Cosroe, to be king alone,
     That I with these my friends and all my men
     May triumph in our long-expected fate.
     The king, your brother, is now hard at hand:
     Meet with the fool, and rid your royal shoulders
     Of such a burden as outweighs the sands
     And all the craggy rocks of Caspia.

          Enter a MESSENGER.

     MESSENGER. My lord,
     We have discovered the enemy
     Ready to charge you with a mighty army.

     COSROE. Come, Tamburlaine; now whet thy winged sword,
     And lift thy lofty arm into [95] the clouds,
     That it may reach the king of Persia's crown,
     And set it safe on my victorious head.

     TAMBURLAINE. See where it is, the keenest curtle-axe
     That e'er made passage thorough Persian arms!
     These are the wings shall make it fly as swift
     As doth the lightning or the breath of heaven,
     And kill as sure [96] as it swiftly flies.

     COSROE. Thy words assure me of kind success:
     Go, valiant soldier, go before, and charge
     The fainting army of that foolish king.

     TAMBURLAINE. Usumcasane and Techelles, come:
     We are enow to scare the enemy,
     And more than needs to make an emperor.

          [Exeunt to the battle.]




SCENE IV.

          Enter MYCETES with his crown in his hand. [97]

     MYCETES. Accurs'd be he that first invented war!
     They knew not, ah, they knew not, simple men,
     How those were [98] hit by pelting cannon-shot
     Stand staggering [99] like a quivering aspen-leaf
     Fearing the force of Boreas' boisterous blasts!
     In what a lamentable case were I,
     If nature had not given me wisdom's lore!
     For kings are clouts that every man shoots at,
     Our crown the pin [100] that thousands seek to cleave:
     Therefore in policy I think it good
     To hide it close; a goodly stratagem,
     And far from any man that is a fool:
     So shall not I be known; or if I be,
     They cannot take away my crown from me.
     Here will I hide it in this simple hole.

          Enter TAMBURLAINE.

     TAMBURLAINE. What, fearful coward, straggling from the camp,
     When kings themselves are present in the field?

     MYCETES. Thou liest.

     TAMBURLAINE. Base villain, darest thou give me [101] the lie?

     MYCETES. Away! I am the king; go; touch me not.
     Thou break'st the law of arms, unless thou kneel,
     And cry me "mercy, noble king!"

     TAMBURLAINE. Are you the witty king of Persia?

     MYCETES. Ay, marry, [102] am I:  have you any suit to me?

     TAMBURLAINE. I would entreat you to speak but three wise words.

     MYCETES. So I can when I see my time.

     TAMBURLAINE. Is this your crown?

     MYCETES. Ay:  didst thou ever see a fairer?

     TAMBURLAINE. You will not sell it, will you?

     MYCETES. Such another word, and I will have thee executed.  Come,
     give it me.

     TAMBURLAINE. No; I took it prisoner.

     MYCETES. You lie; I gave it you.

     TAMBURLAINE. Then 'tis mine.

     MYCETES. No; I mean I let you keep it.

     TAMBURLAINE. Well, I mean you shall have it again.
     Here, take it for a while:  I lend it thee,
     Till I may see thee hemm'd with armed men;
     Then shalt thou see me pull it from thy head:
     Thou art no match for mighty Tamburlaine.

          [Exit.]

     MYCETES. O gods, is this Tamburlaine the thief?
     I marvel much he stole it not away.

          [Trumpets within sound to the battle:  he runs out.]




SCENE V.

          Enter COSROE, TAMBURLAINE, MENAPHON, MEANDER, ORTYGIUS,
          THERIDAMAS, TECHELLES, USUMCASANE, with others.

     TAMBURLAINE. Hold thee, Cosroe; wear two imperial crowns;
     Think thee invested now as royally,
     Even by the mighty hand of Tamburlaine,
     As if as many kings as could encompass thee
     With greatest pomp had crown'd thee emperor.

     COSROE. So do I, thrice-renowmed man-at-arms; [103]
     And none shall keep the crown but Tamburlaine:
     Thee do I make my regent of Persia,
     And general-lieutenant of my armies.--
     Meander, you, that were our brother's guide,
     And chiefest [104] counsellor in all his acts,
     Since he is yielded to the stroke of war,
     On your submission we with thanks excuse,
     And give you equal place in our affairs.

     MEANDER. Most happy [105] emperor, in humblest terms
     I vow my service to your majesty,
     With utmost virtue of my faith and duty.

     COSROE. Thanks, good Meander.--Then, Cosroe, reign,
     And govern Persia in her former pomp.
     Now send embassage to thy neighbour kings,
     And let them know the Persian king is chang'd,
     From one that knew not what a king should do,
     To one that can command what 'longs thereto.
     And now we will to fair Persepolis
     With twenty thousand expert soldiers.
     The lords and captains of my brother's camp
     With little slaughter take Meander's course,
     And gladly yield them to my gracious rule.--
     Ortygius and Menaphon, my trusty friends,
     Now will I gratify your former good,
     And grace your calling with a greater sway.

     ORTYGIUS. And as we ever aim'd [106] at your behoof,
     And sought your state all honour it [107] deserv'd,
     So will we with our powers and our [108] lives
     Endeavour to preserve and prosper it.

     COSROE. I will not thank thee, sweet Ortygius;
     Better replies shall prove my purposes.--
     And now, Lord Tamburlaine, my brother's camp
     I leave to thee and to Theridamas,
     To follow me to fair Persepolis;
     Then will we [109] march to all those Indian mines
     My witless brother to the Christians lost,
     And ransom them with fame and usury:
     And, till thou overtake me, Tamburlaine,
     (Staying to order all the scatter'd troops,)
     Farewell, lord regent and his happy friends.
     I long to sit upon my brother's throne.

     MEANDER. Your majesty shall shortly have your wish,
     And ride in triumph through Persepolis.

          [Exeunt all except TAMBURLAINE, THERIDAMAS, TECHELLES, and
          USUMCASANE.]

     TAMBURLAINE. And ride in triumph through Persepolis!--
     Is it not brave to be a king, Techelles?--
     Usumcasane and Theridamas,
     Is it not passing brave to be a king,
     And ride in triumph through Persepolis?

     TECHELLES. O, my lord, it is sweet and full of pomp!

     USUMCASANE. To be a king is half to be a god.

     THERIDAMAS. A god is not so glorious as a king:
     I think the pleasure they enjoy in heaven,
     Cannot compare with kingly joys in [110] earth;--
     To wear a crown enchas'd with pearl and gold,
     Whose virtues carry with it life and death;
     To ask and have, command and be obey'd;
     When looks breed love, with looks to gain the prize,--
     Such power attractive shines in princes' eyes.

     TAMBURLAINE. Why, say, Theridamas, wilt thou be a king?

     THERIDAMAS. Nay, though I praise it, I can live without it.

     TAMBURLAINE. What say my other friends? will you be kings?

     TECHELLES. I, if I could, with all my heart, my lord.

     TAMBURLAINE. Why, that's well said, Techelles:  so would I;--
     And so would you, my masters, would you not?

     USUMCASANE. What, then, my lord?

     TAMBURLAINE. Why, then, Casane, [111] shall we wish for aught
     The world affords in greatest novelty,
     And rest attemptless, faint, and destitute?
     Methinks we should not.  I am strongly mov'd,
     That if I should desire the Persian crown,
     I could attain it with a wondrous ease:
     And would not all our soldiers soon consent,
     If we should aim at such a dignity?

     THERIDAMAS. I know they would with our persuasions.

     TAMBURLAINE. Why, then, Theridamas, I'll first assay
     To get the Persian kingdom to myself;
     Then thou for Parthia; they for Scythia and Media;
     And, if I prosper, all shall be as sure
     As if the Turk, the Pope, Afric, and Greece,
     Came creeping to us with their crowns a-piece. [112]

     TECHELLES. Then shall we send to this triumphing king,
     And bid him battle for his novel crown?

     USUMCASANE. Nay, quickly, then, before his room be hot.

     TAMBURLAINE. 'Twill prove a pretty jest, in faith, my friends.

     THERIDAMAS. A jest to charge on twenty thousand men!
     I judge the purchase [113] more important far.

     TAMBURLAINE. Judge by thyself, Theridamas, not me;
     For presently Techelles here shall haste
     To bid him battle ere he pass too far,
     And lose more labour than the gain will quite: [114]
     Then shalt thou see this [115] Scythian Tamburlaine
     Make but a jest to win the Persian crown.--
     Techelles, take a thousand horse with thee,
     And bid him turn him [116] back to war with us,
     That only made him king to make us sport:
     We will not steal upon him cowardly,
     But give him warning and [117] more warriors:
     Haste thee, Techelles; we will follow thee.

          [Exit TECHELLES.]

     What saith Theridamas?

     THERIDAMAS. Go on, for me.

          [Exeunt.]




SCENE VI.

          Enter COSROE, MEANDER, ORTYGIUS, and MENAPHON, with
          SOLDIERS.

     COSROE. What means this devilish shepherd, to aspire
     With such a giantly presumption,
     To cast up hills against the face of heaven,
     And dare the force of angry Jupiter?
     But, as he thrust them underneath the hills,
     And press'd out fire from their burning jaws,
     So will I send this monstrous slave to hell,
     Where flames shall ever feed upon his soul.

     MEANDER. Some powers divine, or else infernal, mix'd
     Their angry seeds at his conception;
     For he was never sprung [118] of human race,
     Since with the spirit of his fearful pride,
     He dares [119] so doubtlessly resolve of rule,
     And by profession be ambitious.

     ORTYGIUS. What god, or fiend, or spirit of the earth,
     Or monster turned to a manly shape,
     Or of what mould or mettle he be made,
     What star or fate [120] soever govern him,
     Let us put on our meet encountering minds;
     And, in detesting such a devilish thief,
     In love of honour and defence of right,
     Be arm'd against the hate of such a foe,
     Whether from earth, or hell, or heaven he grow.

     COSROE. Nobly resolv'd, my good Ortygius;
     And, since we all have suck'd one wholesome air,
     And with the same proportion of elements
     Resolve, [121] I hope we are resembled,
     Vowing our loves to equal death and life.
     Let's cheer our soldiers to encounter him,
     That grievous image of ingratitude,
     That fiery thirster after sovereignty,
     And burn him in the fury of that flame
     That none can quench but blood and empery.
     Resolve, my lords and loving soldiers, now
     To save your king and country from decay.
     Then strike up, drum; and all the stars that make
     The loathsome circle of my dated life,
     Direct my weapon to his barbarous heart,
     That thus opposeth him against the gods,
     And scorns the powers that govern Persia!

          [Exeunt, drums sounding.]




SCENE VII.

          Alarms of battle within.  Then enter COSROE wounded,
          TAMBURLAINE, THERIDAMAS, TECHELLES, USUMCASANE, with others.

     COSROE. Barbarous [122] and bloody Tamburlaine,
     Thus to deprive me of my crown and life!--
     Treacherous and false Theridamas,
     Even at the morning of my happy state,
     Scarce being seated in my royal throne,
     To work my downfall and untimely end!
     An uncouth pain torments my grieved soul;
     And death arrests the organ of my voice,
     Who, entering at the breach thy sword hath made,
     Sacks every vein and artier [123] of my heart.--
     Bloody and insatiate Tamburlaine!

     TAMBURLAINE. The thirst of reign and sweetness of a crown,
     That caus'd the eldest son of heavenly Ops
     To thrust his doting father from his chair,
     And place himself in the empyreal heaven,
     Mov'd me to manage arms against thy state.
     What better precedent than mighty Jove?
     Nature, that fram'd us of four elements
     Warring within our breasts for regiment, [124]
     Doth teach us all to have aspiring minds:
     Our souls, whose faculties can comprehend
     The wondrous architecture of the world,
     And measure every wandering planet's course,
     Still climbing after knowledge infinite,
     And always moving as the restless spheres,
     Will us to wear ourselves, and never rest,
     Until we reach the ripest fruit [125] of all,
     That perfect bliss and sole felicity,
     The sweet fruition of an earthly crown.

     THERIDAMAS. And that made me to join with Tamburlaine;
     For he is gross and like the massy earth
     That moves not upwards, nor by princely deeds
     Doth mean to soar above the highest sort.

     TECHELLES. And that made us, the friends of Tamburlaine,
     To lift our swords against the Persian king.

     USUMCASANE. For as, when Jove did thrust old Saturn down,
     Neptune and Dis gain'd each of them a crown,
     So do we hope to reign in Asia,
     If Tamburlaine be plac'd in Persia.

     COSROE. The strangest men that ever nature made!
     I know not how to take their tyrannies.
     My bloodless body waxeth chill and cold,
     And with my blood my life slides through my wound;
     My soul begins to take her flight to hell,
     And summons all my senses to depart:
     The heat and moisture, which did feed each other,
     For want of nourishment to feed them both,
     Are [126] dry and cold; and now doth ghastly Death
     With greedy talents [127] gripe my bleeding heart,
     And like a harpy [128] tires on my life.--
     Theridamas and Tamburlaine, I die:
     And fearful vengeance light upon you both!

          [Dies.--TAMBURLAINE takes COSROE'S crown, and puts it on
          his own head.]

     TAMBURLAINE. Not all the curses which the [129] Furies breathe
     Shall make me leave so rich a prize as this.
     Theridamas, Techelles, and the rest,
     Who think you now is king of Persia?

     ALL. Tamburlaine!  Tamburlaine!

     TAMBURLAINE. Though Mars himself, the angry god of arms,
     And all the earthly potentates conspire
     To dispossess me of this diadem,
     Yet will I wear it in despite of them,
     As great commander of this eastern world,
     If you but say that Tamburlaine shall reign.

     ALL. Long live Tamburlaine, and reign in Asia!

     TAMBURLAINE. So; now it is more surer on my head
     Than if the gods had held a parliament,
     And all pronounc'd me king of Persia.

          [Exeunt.]




ACT III.




SCENE I.

          Enter BAJAZETH, the KINGS OF FEZ, MOROCCO, and ARGIER, with
          others, in great pomp.

     BAJAZETH. Great kings of Barbary, and my portly bassoes, [130]
     We hear the Tartars and the eastern thieves,
     Under the conduct of one Tamburlaine,
     Presume a bickering with your emperor,
     And think to rouse us from our dreadful siege
     Of the famous Grecian Constantinople.
     You know our army is invincible;
     As many circumcised Turks we have,
     And warlike bands of Christians renied, [131]
     As hath the ocean or the Terrene [132] sea
     Small drops of water when the moon begins
     To join in one her semicircled horns:
     Yet would we not be brav'd with foreign power,
     Nor raise our siege before the Grecians yield,
     Or breathless lie before the city-walls.

     KING OF FEZ. Renowmed [133] emperor and mighty general,
     What, if you sent the bassoes of your guard
     To charge him to remain in Asia,
     Or else to threaten death and deadly arms
     As from the mouth of mighty Bajazeth?

     BAJAZETH. Hie thee, my basso, [134] fast to Persia;
     Tell him thy lord, the Turkish emperor,
     Dread lord of Afric, Europe, and Asia,
     Great king and conqueror of Graecia,
     The ocean, Terrene, and the Coal-black sea,
     The high and highest monarch of the world,
     Wills and commands, (for say not I entreat,)
     Not [135] once to set his foot in [136] Africa,
     Or spread [137] his colours in Graecia,
     Lest he incur the fury of my wrath:
     Tell him I am content to take a truce,
     Because I hear he bears a valiant mind:
     But if, presuming on his silly power,
     He be so mad to manage arms with me,
     Then stay thou with him,--say, I bid thee so;
     And if, before the sun have measur'd heaven [138]
     With triple circuit, thou regreet us not,
     We mean to take his morning's next arise
     For messenger he will not be reclaim'd,
     And mean to fetch thee in despite of him.

     BASSO. Most great and puissant monarch of the earth,
     Your basso will accomplish your behest,
     And shew your pleasure to the Persian,
     As fits the legate of the stately Turk.

          [Exit.]

     KING OF ARGIER. They say he is the king of Persia;
     But, if he dare attempt to stir your siege,
     'Twere requisite he should be ten times more,
     For all flesh quakes at your magnificence.

     BAJAZETH. True, Argier; and tremble[s] at my looks.

     KING OF MOROCCO. The spring is hinder'd by your smothering host;
     For neither rain can fall upon the earth,
     Nor sun reflex his virtuous beams thereon,
     The ground is mantled with such multitudes.

     BAJAZETH. All this is true as holy Mahomet;
     And all the trees are blasted with our breaths.

     KING OF FEZ. What thinks your greatness best to be achiev'd
     In pursuit of the city's overthrow?

     BAJAZETH. I will the captive pioners [139] of Argier
     Cut off the water that by leaden pipes
     Runs to the city from the mountain Carnon;
     Two thousand horse shall forage up and down,
     That no relief or succour come by land;
     And all the sea my galleys countermand:
     Then shall our footmen lie within the trench,
     And with their cannons, mouth'd like Orcus' gulf,
     Batter the walls, and we will enter in;
     And thus the Grecians shall be conquered.

          [Exeunt.]




SCENE II.

          Enter ZENOCRATE, AGYDAS, ANIPPE, with others.

     AGYDAS. Madam Zenocrate, may I presume
     To know the cause of these unquiet fits
     That work such trouble to your wonted rest?
     'Tis more than pity such a heavenly face
     Should by heart's sorrow wax so wan and pale,
     When your offensive rape by Tamburlaine
     (Which of your whole displeasures should be most)
     Hath seem'd to be digested long ago.

     ZENOCRATE. Although it be digested long ago,
     As his exceeding favours have deserv'd,
     And might content the Queen of Heaven, as well
     As it hath chang'd my first-conceiv'd disdain;
     Yet since a farther passion feeds my thoughts
     With ceaseless [140] and disconsolate conceits, [141]
     Which dye my looks so lifeless as they are,
     And might, if my extremes had full events,
     Make me the ghastly counterfeit [142] of death.

     AGYDAS. Eternal heaven sooner be dissolv'd,
     And all that pierceth Phoebus' silver eye,
     Before such hap fall to Zenocrate!

     ZENOCRATE. Ah, life and soul, still hover in his [143] breast,
     And leave my body senseless as the earth,
     Or else unite you [144] to his life and soul,
     That I may live and die with Tamburlaine!

          Enter, behind, TAMBURLAINE, with TECHELLES, and others.

     AGYDAS. With Tamburlaine!  Ah, fair Zenocrate,
     Let not a man so vile and barbarous,
     That holds you from your father in despite,
     And keeps you from the honours of a queen,
     (Being suppos'd his worthless concubine,)
     Be honour'd with your love but for necessity!
     So, now the mighty Soldan hears of you,
     Your highness needs not doubt but in short time
     He will, with Tamburlaine's destruction,
     Redeem you from this deadly servitude.

     ZENOCRATE. Leave [145] to wound me with these words,
     And speak of Tamburlaine as he deserves:
     The entertainment we have had of him
     Is far from villany or servitude,
     And might in noble minds be counted princely.

     AGYDAS. How can you fancy one that looks so fierce,
     Only dispos'd to martial stratagems?
     Who, when he shall embrace you in his arms,
     Will tell how many thousand men he slew;
     And, when you look for amorous discourse,
     Will rattle forth his facts [146] of war and blood,
     Too harsh a subject for your dainty ears.

     ZENOCRATE. As looks the sun through Nilus' flowing stream,
     Or when the Morning holds him in her arms,
     So looks my lordly love, fair Tamburlaine;
     His talk much [147] sweeter than the Muses' song
     They sung for honour 'gainst Pierides, [148]
     Or when Minerva did with Neptune strive:
     And higher would I rear my estimate
     Than Juno, sister to the highest god,
     If I were match'd with mighty Tamburlaine.

     AGYDAS. Yet be not so inconstant in your love,
     But let the young Arabian [149] live in hope,
     After your rescue to enjoy his choice.
     You see, though first the king of Persia,
     Being a shepherd, seem'd to love you much,
     Now, in his majesty, he leaves those looks,
     Those words of favour, and those comfortings,
     And gives no more than common courtesies.

     ZENOCRATE. Thence rise the tears that so distain my cheeks,
     Fearing his love [150] through my unworthiness.

          [TAMBURLAINE goes to her, and takes her away lovingly by
          the hand, looking wrathfully on AGYDAS, and says nothing.
          Exeunt all except AGYDAS.]

     AGYDAS. Betray'd by fortune and suspicious love,
     Threaten'd with frowning wrath and jealousy,
     Surpris'd with fear of [151] hideous revenge,
     I stand aghast; but most astonied
     To see his choler shut in secret thoughts,
     And wrapt in silence of his angry soul:
     Upon his brows was pourtray'd ugly death;
     And in his eyes the fury [152] of his heart,
     That shone [153] as comets, menacing revenge,
     And cast a pale complexion on his cheeks.
     As when the seaman sees the Hyades
     Gather an army of Cimmerian clouds,
     (Auster and Aquilon with winged steeds,
     All sweating, tilt about the watery heavens,
     With shivering spears enforcing thunder-claps,
     And from their shields strike flames of lightning,)
     All-fearful folds his sails, and sounds the main,
     Lifting his prayers to the heavens for aid
     Against the terror of the winds and waves;
     So fares Agydas for the late-felt frowns,
     That send [154] a tempest to my daunted thoughts,
     And make my soul divine her overthrow.

          Re-enter TECHELLES with a naked dagger, and USUMCASANE.

     TECHELLES. See you, Agydas, how the king salutes you!
     He bids you prophesy what it imports.

     AGYDAS. I prophesied before, and now I prove
     The killing frowns of jealousy and love.
     He needed not with words confirm my fear,
     For words are vain where working tools present
     The naked action of my threaten'd end:
     It says, Agydas, thou shalt surely die,
     And of extremities elect the least;
     More honour and less pain it may procure,
     To die by this resolved hand of thine
     Than stay the torments he and heaven have sworn.
     Then haste, Agydas, and prevent the plagues
     Which thy prolonged fates may draw on thee:
     Go wander free from fear of tyrant's rage,
     Removed from the torments and the hell
     Wherewith he may excruciate thy soul;
     And let Agydas by Agydas die,
     And with this stab slumber eternally.

          [Stabs himself.]

     TECHELLES. Usumcasane, see, how right the man
     Hath hit the meaning of my lord the king!

     USUMCASANE. Faith, and, Techelles, it was manly done;
     And, since he was so wise and honourable,
     Let us afford him now the bearing hence,
     And crave his triple-worthy burial.

     TECHELLES. Agreed, Casane; we will honour him.

          [Exeunt, bearing out the body.]




SCENE III.

          Enter TAMBURLAINE, TECHELLES, USUMCASANE, THERIDAMAS,
          a BASSO, ZENOCRATE, ANIPPE, with others.

     TAMBURLAINE. Basso, by this thy lord and master knows
     I mean to meet him in Bithynia:
     See, how he comes! tush, Turks are full of brags,
     And menace [155] more than they can well perform.
     He meet me in the field, and fetch [156] thee hence!
     Alas, poor Turk! his fortune is too weak
     T' encounter with the strength of Tamburlaine:
     View well my camp, and speak indifferently;
     Do not my captains and my soldiers look
     As if they meant to conquer Africa?

     BASSO. Your men are valiant, but their number few,
     And cannot terrify his mighty host:
     My lord, the great commander of the world,
     Besides fifteen contributory kings,
     Hath now in arms ten thousand janizaries,
     Mounted on lusty Mauritanian steeds,
     Brought to the war by men of Tripoly;
     Two hundred thousand footmen that have serv'd
     In two set battles fought in Graecia;
     And for the expedition of this war,
     If he think good, can from his garrisons
     Withdraw as many more to follow him.

     TECHELLES. The more he brings, the greater is the spoil;
     For, when they perish by our warlike hands,
     We mean to set [157] our footmen on their steeds,
     And rifle all those stately janizars.

     TAMBURLAINE. But will those kings accompany your lord?

     BASSO. Such as his highness please; but some must stay
     To rule the provinces he late subdu'd.

     TAMBURLAINE. [To his OFFICERS]
     Then fight courageously:  their crowns are yours;
     This hand shall set them on your conquering heads,
     That made me emperor of Asia.

     USUMCASANE. Let him bring millions infinite of men,
     Unpeopling Western Africa and Greece,
     Yet we assure us of the victory.

     THERIDAMAS. Even he, that in a trice vanquish'd two kings
     More mighty than the Turkish emperor,
     Shall rouse him out of Europe, and pursue
     His scatter'd army till they yield or die.

     TAMBURLAINE. Well said, Theridamas! speak in that mood;
     For WILL and SHALL best fitteth Tamburlaine,
     Whose smiling stars give him assured hope
     Of martial triumph ere he meet his foes.
     I that am term'd the scourge and wrath of God,
     The only fear and terror of the world,
     Will first subdue the Turk, and then enlarge
     Those Christian captives which you keep as slaves,
     Burdening their bodies with your heavy chains,
     And feeding them with thin and slender fare;
     That naked row about the Terrene [158] sea,
     And, when they chance to rest or breathe [159] a space,
     Are punish'd with bastones [160] so grievously
     That they [161] lie panting on the galleys' side,
     And strive for life at every stroke they give.
     These are the cruel pirates of Argier,
     That damned train, the scum of Africa,
     Inhabited with straggling runagates,
     That make quick havoc of the Christian blood:
     But, as I live, that town shall curse the time
     That Tamburlaine set foot in Africa.

          Enter BAJAZETH, BASSOES, the KINGS OF FEZ, MOROCCO,
          and ARGIER; ZABINA and EBEA.

     BAJAZETH. Bassoes and janizaries of my guard,
     Attend upon the person of your lord,
     The greatest potentate of Africa.

     TAMBURLAINE. Techelles and the rest, prepare your swords;
     I mean t' encounter with that Bajazeth.

     BAJAZETH. Kings of Fez, Morocco, [162] and Argier,
     He calls me Bajazeth, whom you call lord!
     Note the presumption of this Scythian slave!--
     I tell thee, villain, those that lead my horse
     Have to their names titles [163] of dignity;
     And dar'st thou bluntly call me Bajazeth?

     TAMBURLAINE. And know, thou Turk, that those which lead my horse
     Shall lead thee captive thorough Africa;
     And dar'st thou bluntly call me Tamburlaine?

     BAJAZETH. By Mahomet my kinsman's sepulchre,
     And by the holy Alcoran I swear,
     He shall be made a chaste and lustless eunuch,
     And in my sarell [164] tend my concubines;
     And all his captains, that thus stoutly stand,
     Shall draw the chariot of my emperess,
     Whom I have brought to see their overthrow!

     TAMBURLAINE. By this my sword that conquer'd Persia,
     Thy fall shall make me famous through the world!
     I will not tell thee how I'll [165] handle thee,
     But every common soldier of my camp
     Shall smile to see thy miserable state.

     KING OF FEZ. What means the [166] mighty Turkish emperor,
     To talk with one so base as Tamburlaine?

     KING OF MOROCCO. Ye Moors and valiant men of Barbary.
     How can ye suffer these indignities?

     KING OF ARGIER. Leave words, and let them feel your lances'
     points,
     Which glided through the bowels of the Greeks.

     BAJAZETH. Well said, my stout contributory kings!
     Your threefold army and my hugy [167] host
     Shall swallow up these base-born Persians.

     TECHELLES. Puissant, renowm'd, [168] and mighty Tamburlaine,
     Why stay we thus prolonging of [169] their lives?

     THERIDAMAS. I long to see those crowns won by our swords,
     That we may rule [170] as kings of Africa.

     USUMCASANE. What coward would not fight for such a prize?

     TAMBURLAINE. Fight all courageously, and be you kings:
     I speak it, and my words are oracles.

     BAJAZETH. Zabina, mother of three braver [171] boys
     Than Hercules, that in his infancy
     Did pash [172] the jaws of serpents venomous;
     Whose hands are made to gripe a warlike lance,
     Their shoulders broad for complete armour fit,
     Their limbs more large and of a bigger size
     Than all the brats y-sprung [173] from Typhon's loins;
     Who, when they come unto their father's age,
     Will batter turrets with their manly fists;--
     Sit here upon this royal chair of state,
     And on thy head wear my imperial crown,
     Until I bring this sturdy Tamburlaine
     And all his captains bound in captive chains.

     ZABINA. Such good success happen to Bajazeth!

     TAMBURLAINE. Zenocrate, the loveliest maid alive,
     Fairer than rocks of pearl and precious stone,
     The only paragon of Tamburlaine;
     Whose eyes are brighter than the lamps of heaven,
     And speech more pleasant than sweet harmony;
     That with thy looks canst clear the darken'd sky,
     And calm the rage of thundering Jupiter;
     Sit down by her, adorned with my crown,
     As if thou wert the empress of the world.
     Stir not, Zenocrate, until thou see
     Me march victoriously with all my men,
     Triumphing over him and these his kings,
     Which I will bring as vassals to thy feet;
     Till then, take thou my crown, vaunt of my worth,
     And manage words with her, as we will arms.

     ZENOCRATE. And may my love, the king of Persia,
     Return with victory and free from wound!

     BAJAZETH. Now shalt thou feel the force of Turkish arms,
     Which lately made all Europe quake for fear.
     I have of Turks, Arabians, Moors, and Jews,
     Enough to cover all Bithynia:
     Let thousands die; their slaughter'd carcasses
     Shall serve for walls and bulwarks to the rest;
     And as the heads of Hydra, so my power,
     Subdu'd, shall stand as mighty as before:
     If they should yield their necks unto the sword,
     Thy soldiers' arms could not endure to strike
     So many blows as I have heads for them. [174]
     Thou know'st not, foolish-hardy Tamburlaine,
     What 'tis to meet me in the open field,
     That leave no ground for thee to march upon.

     TAMBURLAINE. Our conquering swords shall marshal us the way
     We use to march upon the slaughter'd foe,
     Trampling their bowels with our horses' hoofs,
     Brave horses bred on the [175] white Tartarian hills
     My camp is like to Julius Caesar's host,
     That never fought but had the victory;
     Nor in Pharsalia was there such hot war
     As these, my followers, willingly would have.
     Legions of spirits, fleeting in the air,
     Direct our bullets and our weapons' points,
     And make your strokes to wound the senseless light; [176]
     And when she sees our bloody colours spread,
     Then Victory begins to take her flight,
     Resting herself upon my milk-white tent.--
     But come, my lords, to weapons let us fall;
     The field is ours, the Turk, his wife, and all.

          [Exit with his followers.]

     BAJAZETH. Come, kings and bassoes, let us glut our swords,
     That thirst to drink the feeble Persians' blood.

          [Exit with his followers.]

     ZABINA. Base concubine, must thou be plac'd by me
     That am the empress of the mighty Turk?

     ZENOCRATE. Disdainful Turkess, and unreverend boss, [177]
     Call'st thou me concubine, that am betroth'd
     Unto the great and mighty Tamburlaine?

     ZABINA. To Tamburlaine, the great Tartarian thief!

     ZENOCRATE. Thou wilt repent these lavish words of thine
     When thy great basso-master and thyself
     Must plead for mercy at his kingly feet,
     And sue to me to be your advocate. [178]

     ZABINA. And sue to thee!  I tell thee, shameless girl,
     Thou shalt be laundress to my waiting-maid.--
     How lik'st thou her, Ebea? will she serve?

     EBEA. Madam, she thinks perhaps she is too fine;
     But I shall turn her into other weeds,
     And make her dainty fingers fall to work.

     ZENOCRATE. Hear'st thou, Anippe, how thy drudge doth talk?
     And how my slave, her mistress, menaceth?
     Both for their sauciness shall be employ'd
     To dress the common soldiers' meat and drink;
     For we will scorn they should come near ourselves.

     ANIPPE. Yet sometimes let your highness send for them
     To do the work my chambermaid disdains.

          [They sound to the battle within.]

     ZENOCRATE. Ye gods and powers that govern Persia,
     And made my lordly love her worthy king,
     Now strengthen him against the Turkish Bajazeth,
     And let his foes, like flocks of fearful roes
     Pursu'd by hunters, fly his angry looks,
     That I may see him issue conqueror!

     ZABINA. Now, Mahomet, solicit God himself,
     And make him rain down murdering shot from heaven,
     To dash the Scythians' brains, and strike them dead,
     That dare [179] to manage arms with him
     That offer'd jewels to thy sacred shrine
     When first he warr'd against the Christians!

          [They sound again to the battle within.]

     ZENOCRATE. By this the Turks lie weltering in their blood,
     And Tamburlaine is lord of Africa.

     ZABINA. Thou art deceiv'd.  I heard the trumpets sound
     As when my emperor overthrew the Greeks,
     And led them captive into Africa.
     Straight will I use thee as thy pride deserves;
     Prepare thyself to live and die my slave.

     ZENOCRATE. If Mahomet should come from heaven and swear
     My royal lord is slain or conquered,
     Yet should he not persuade me otherwise
     But that he lives and will be conqueror.

          Re-enter BAJAZETH, pursued by TAMBURLAINE. [180]

     TAMBURLAINE. Now, king of bassoes, who is conqueror?

     BAJAZETH. Thou, by the fortune of this damned foil. [181]

     TAMBURLAINE. Where are your stout contributory kings?

          Re-enter TECHELLES, THERIDAMAS, and USUMCASANE.

     TECHELLES. We have their crowns; their bodies strow the field.

     TAMBURLAINE. Each man a crown! why, kingly fought, i'faith.
     Deliver them into my treasury.

     ZENOCRATE. Now let me offer to my gracious lord
     His royal crown again so highly won.

     TAMBURLAINE. Nay, take the Turkish crown from her, Zenocrate,
     And crown me emperor of Africa.

     ZABINA. No, Tamburlaine; though now thou gat [182] the best,
     Thou shalt not yet be lord of Africa.

     THERIDAMAS. Give her the crown, Turkess, you were best.

          [Takes it from her.]

     ZABINA. Injurious villains, thieves, runagates,
     How dare you thus abuse my majesty?

     THERIDAMAS. Here, madam, you are empress; she is none.

          [Gives it to ZENOCRATE.]

     TAMBURLAINE. Not now, Theridamas; her time is past:
     The pillars, that have bolster'd up those terms,
     Are faln in clusters at my conquering feet.

     ZABINA. Though he be prisoner, he may be ransom'd.

     TAMBURLAINE. Not all the world shall ransom Bajazeth.

     BAJAZETH. Ah, fair Zabina! we have lost the field;
     And never had the Turkish emperor
     So great a foil by any foreign foe.
     Now will the Christian miscreants be glad,
     Ringing with joy their superstitious bells,
     And making bonfires for my overthrow:
     But, ere I die, those foul idolaters
     Shall make me bonfires with their filthy bones;
     For, though the glory of this day be lost,
     Afric and Greece have garrisons enough
     To make me sovereign of the earth again.

     TAMBURLAINE. Those walled garrisons will I subdue,
     And write myself great lord of Africa:
     So from the East unto the furthest West
     Shall Tamburlaine extend his puissant arm.
     The galleys and those pilling [183] brigandines,
     That yearly sail to the Venetian gulf,
     And hover in the Straits for Christians' wreck,
     Shall lie at anchor in the Isle Asant,
     Until the Persian fleet and men-of-war,
     Sailing along the oriental sea,
     Have fetch'd about the Indian continent,
     Even from Persepolis to Mexico,
     And thence unto the Straits of Jubalter;
     Where they shall meet and join their force in one.
     Keeping in awe the Bay of Portingale,
     And all the ocean by the British [184] shore;
     And by this means I'll win the world at last.

     BAJAZETH. Yet set a ransom on me, Tamburlaine.

     TAMBURLAINE. What, think'st thou Tamburlaine esteems thy gold?
     I'll make the kings of India, ere I die,
     Offer their mines, to sue for peace, to me,
     And dig for treasure to appease my wrath.--
     Come, bind them both, and one lead in the Turk;
     The Turkess let my love's maid lead away,

          [They bind them.]

     BAJAZETH. Ah, villains, dare you touch my sacred arms?--
     O Mahomet!  O sleepy Mahomet!

     ZABINA. O cursed Mahomet, that mak'st us thus
     The slaves to Scythians rude and barbarous!

     TAMBURLAINE. Come, bring them in; and for this happy conquest
     Triumph, and solemnize a martial [185] feast.

          [Exeunt.]




ACT IV.




SCENE I.

          Enter the SOLDAN OF EGYPT, CAPOLIN, LORDS, and a MESSENGER.

     SOLDAN. Awake, ye men of Memphis! [186] hear the clang
     Of Scythian trumpets; hear the basilisks, [187]
     That, roaring, shake Damascus' turrets down!
     The rogue of Volga holds Zenocrate,
     The Soldan's daughter, for his concubine,
     And, with a troop of thieves and vagabonds,
     Hath spread his colours to our high disgrace,
     While you, faint-hearted base Egyptians,
     Lie slumbering on the flowery banks of Nile,
     As crocodiles that unaffrighted rest
     While thundering cannons rattle on their skins.

     MESSENGER. Nay, mighty Soldan, did your greatness see
     The frowning looks of fiery Tamburlaine,
     That with his terror and imperious eyes
     Commands the hearts of his associates,
     It might amaze your royal majesty.

     SOLDAN. Villain, I tell thee, were that Tamburlaine
     As monstrous [188] as Gorgon prince of hell,
     The Soldan would not start a foot from him.
     But speak, what power hath he?

     MESSENGER. Mighty lord,
     Three hundred thousand men in armour clad,
     Upon their prancing steeds, disdainfully
     With wanton paces trampling on the ground;
     Five hundred thousand footmen threatening shot,
     Shaking their swords, their spears, and iron bills,
     Environing their standard round, that stood
     As bristle-pointed as a thorny wood;
     Their warlike engines and munition
     Exceed the forces of their martial men.

     SOLDAN. Nay, could their numbers countervail the stars,
     Or ever-drizzling [189] drops of April showers,
     Or wither'd leaves that autumn shaketh down,
     Yet would the Soldan by his conquering power
     So scatter and consume them in his rage,
     That not a man should [190] live to rue their fall.

     CAPOLIN. So might your highness, had you time to sort
     Your fighting men, and raise your royal host;
     But Tamburlaine by expedition
     Advantage takes of your unreadiness.

     SOLDAN. Let him take all th' advantages he can:
     Were all the world conspir'd to fight for him,
     Nay, were he devil, [191] as he is no man,
     Yet in revenge of fair Zenocrate,
     Whom he detaineth in despite of us,
     This arm should send him down to Erebus,
     To shroud his shame in darkness of the night.

     MESSENGER. Pleaseth your mightiness to understand,
     His resolution far exceedeth all.
     The first day when he pitcheth down his tents,
     White is their hue, and on his silver crest
     A snowy feather spangled-white he bears,
     To signify the mildness of his mind,
     That, satiate with spoil, refuseth blood:
     But, when Aurora mounts the second time,
     As red as scarlet is his furniture;
     Then must his kindled wrath be quench'd with blood,
     Not sparing any that can manage arms:
     But, if these threats move not submission,
     Black are his colours, black pavilion;
     His spear, his shield, his horse, his armour, plumes,
     And jetty feathers, menace death and hell;
     Without respect of sex, degree, or age,
     He razeth all his foes with fire and sword.

     SOLDAN. Merciless villain, peasant, ignorant
     Of lawful arms or martial discipline!
     Pillage and murder are his usual trades:
     The slave usurps the glorious name of war.
     See, Capolin, the fair Arabian king, [192]
     That hath been disappointed by this slave
     Of my fair daughter and his princely love,
     May have fresh warning to go war with us,
     And be reveng'd for her disparagement.

          [Exeunt.]




SCENE II.

          Enter TAMBURLAINE, TECHELLES, THERIDAMAS, USUMCASANE,
          ZENOCRATE, ANIPPE, two MOORS drawing BAJAZETH in a cage,
          and ZABINA following him.

     TAMBURLAINE. Bring out my footstool.

          [They take BAJAZETH out of the cage.]

     BAJAZETH. Ye holy priests of heavenly Mahomet,
     That, sacrificing, slice and cut your flesh,
     Staining his altars with your purple blood,
     Make heaven to frown, and every fixed star
     To suck up poison from the moorish fens,
     And pour it [193] in this glorious tyrant's throat!

     TAMBURLAINE. The chiefest god, first mover of that sphere
     Enchas'd with thousands ever-shining lamps,
     Will sooner burn the glorious frame of heaven
     Than it should [194] so conspire my overthrow.
     But, villain, thou that wishest this [195] to me,
     Fall prostrate on the low disdainful earth,
     And be the footstool of great Tamburlaine,
     That I may rise into [196] my royal throne.

     BAJAZETH. First shalt thou rip my bowels with thy sword,
     And sacrifice my heart [197] to death and hell,
     Before I yield to such a slavery.

     TAMBURLAINE. Base villain, vassal, slave to Tamburlaine,
     Unworthy to embrace or touch the ground
     That bears the honour of my royal weight;
     Stoop, villain, stoop! stoop; [198] for so he bids
     That may command thee piecemeal to be torn,
     Or scatter'd like the lofty cedar-trees
     Struck with the voice of thundering Jupiter.

     BAJAZETH. Then, as I look down to the damned fiends,
     Fiends, look on me! and thou, dread god of hell,
     With ebon sceptre strike this hateful earth,
     And make it swallow both of us at once!

          [TAMBURLAINE gets up on him into his chair.]

     TAMBURLAINE. Now clear the triple region of the air,
     And let the Majesty of Heaven behold
     Their scourge and terror tread on emperors.
     Smile, stars that reign'd at my nativity,
     And dim the brightness of your [199] neighbour lamps;
     Disdain to borrow light of Cynthia!
     For I, the chiefest lamp of all the earth,
     First rising in the east with mild aspect,
     But fixed now in the meridian line,
     Will send up fire to your turning spheres,
     And cause the sun to borrow light of you.
     My sword struck fire from his coat of steel,
     Even in Bithynia, when I took this Turk;
     As when a fiery exhalation,
     Wrapt in the bowels of a freezing cloud,
     Fighting for passage, make[s] the welkin crack,
     And casts a flash of lightning to [200] the earth:
     But, ere I march to wealthy Persia,
     Or leave Damascus and th' Egyptian fields,
     As was the fame of Clymene's brain-sick son
     That almost brent [201] the axle-tree of heaven,
     So shall our swords, our lances, and our shot
     Fill all the air with fiery meteors;
     Then, when the sky shall wax as red as blood,
     It shall be said I made it red myself,
     To make me think of naught but blood and war.

     ZABINA. Unworthy king, that by thy cruelty
     Unlawfully usurp'st the Persian seat,
     Dar'st thou, that never saw an emperor
     Before thou met my husband in the field,
     Being thy captive, thus abuse his state,
     Keeping his kingly body in a cage,
     That roofs of gold and sun-bright palaces
     Should have prepar'd to entertain his grace?
     And treading him beneath thy loathsome feet,
     Whose feet the kings [202] of Africa have kiss'd?

     TECHELLES. You must devise some torment worse, my lord,
     To make these captives rein their lavish tongues.

     TAMBURLAINE. Zenocrate, look better to your slave.

     ZENOCRATE. She is my handmaid's slave, and she shall look
     That these abuses flow not from [203] her tongue.--
     Chide her, Anippe.

     ANIPPE. Let these be warnings, then, for you, [204] my slave,
     How you abuse the person of the king;
     Or else I swear to have you whipt stark nak'd. [205]

     BAJAZETH. Great Tamburlaine, great in my overthrow,
     Ambitious pride shall make thee fall as low,
     For treading on the back of Bajazeth,
     That should be horsed on four mighty kings.

     TAMBURLAINE. Thy names, and titles, and thy dignities [206]
     Are fled from Bajazeth, and remain with me,
     That will maintain it 'gainst a world of kings.--
     Put him in again.

          [They put him into the cage.]

     BAJAZETH. Is this a place for mighty Bajazeth?
     Confusion light on him that helps thee thus!

     TAMBURLAINE. There, whiles [207] he lives, shall Bajazeth be kept;
     And, where I go, be thus in triumph drawn;
     And thou, his wife, shalt [208] feed him with the scraps
     My servitors shall bring thee from my board;
     For he that gives him other food than this,
     Shall sit by him, and starve to death himself:
     This is my mind, and I will have it so.
     Not all the kings and emperors of the earth,
     If they would lay their crowne before my feet,
     Shall ransom him, or take him from his cage:
     The ages that shall talk of Tamburlaine,
     Even from this day to Plato's wondrous year,
     Shall talk how I have handled Bajazeth:
     These Moors, that drew him from Bithynia
     To fair Damascus, where we now remain,
     Shall lead him with us wheresoe'er we go.--
     Techelles, and my loving followers,
     Now may we see Damascus' lofty towers,
     Like to the shadows of Pyramides
     That with their beauties grace [209] the Memphian fields.
     The golden stature [210] of their feather'd bird, [211]
     That spreads her wings upon the city-walls,
     Shall not defend it from our battering shot:
     The townsmen mask in silk and cloth of gold,
     And every house is as a treasury;
     The men, the treasure, and the town are [212] ours.

     THERIDAMAS. Your tents of white now pitch'd before the gates,
     And gentle flags of amity display'd,
     I doubt not but the governor will yield,
     Offering Damascus to your majesty.

     TAMBURLAINE. So shall he have his life, and all the rest:
     But, if he stay until the bloody flag
     Be once advanc'd on my vermilion tent,
     He dies, and those that kept us out so long;
     And, when they see me march in black array,
     With mournful streamers hanging down their heads,
     Were in that city all the world contain'd,
     Not one should scape, but perish by our swords.

     ZENOCRATE. Yet would you have some pity for my sake,
     Because it is my country [213] and my father's.

     TAMBURLAINE. Not for the world, Zenocrate, if I have sworn.--
     Come; bring in the Turk.

          [Exeunt.]




SCENE III.

          Enter SOLDAN, KING OF ARABIA, [214] CAPOLIN, and SOLDIERS,
          with streaming colours.

     SOLDAN. Methinks we march as Meleager did,
     Environed with brave Argolian knights,
     To chase the savage Calydonian [215] boar,
     Or Cephalus, with lusty [216] Theban youths,
     Against the wolf that angry Themis sent
     To waste and spoil the sweet Aonian fields.
     A monster of five hundred thousand heads,
     Compact of rapine, piracy, and spoil,
     The scum of men, the hate and scourge of God,
     Raves in Aegyptia, and annoyeth us:
     My lord, it is the bloody Tamburlaine,
     A sturdy felon, and [217] a base-bred thief,
     By murder raised to the Persian crown,
     That dare control us in our territories.
     To tame the pride of this presumptuous beast,
     Join your Arabians with the Soldan's power;
     Let us unite our royal bands in one,
     And hasten to remove Damascus' siege.
     It is a blemish to the majesty
     And high estate of mighty emperors,
     That such a base usurping vagabond
     Should brave a king, or wear a princely crown.

     KING OF ARABIA. Renowmed [218] Soldan, have you lately heard
     The overthrow of mighty Bajazeth
     About the confines of Bithynia?
     The slavery wherewith he persecutes
     The noble Turk and his great emperess?

     SOLDAN. I have, and sorrow for his bad success;
     But, noble lord of great Arabia,
     Be so persuaded that the Soldan is
     No more dismay'd with tidings of his fall,
     Than in the haven when the pilot stands,
     And views a stranger's ship rent in the winds,
     And shivered against a craggy rock:
     Yet in compassion to his wretched state,
     A sacred vow to heaven and him I make,
     Confirming it with Ibis' holy name, [219]
     That Tamburlaine shall rue the day, the [220] hour,
     Wherein he wrought such ignominious wrong
     Unto the hallow'd person of a prince,
     Or kept the fair Zenocrate so long,
     As concubine, I fear, to feed his lust.

     KING OF ARABIA. Let grief and fury hasten on revenge;
     Let Tamburlaine for his offences feel
     Such plagues as heaven and we can pour on him:
     I long to break my spear upon his crest,
     And prove the weight of his victorious arm;
     For fame, I fear, hath been too prodigal
     In sounding through the world his partial praise.

     SOLDAN. Capolin, hast thou survey'd our powers?

     CAPOLIN. Great emperors of Egypt and Arabia,
     The number of your hosts united is,
     A hundred and fifty thousand horse,
     Two hundred thousand foot, brave men-at-arms,
     Courageous and [221] full of hardiness,
     As frolic as the hunters in the chase
     Of savage beasts amid the desert woods.

     KING OF ARABIA. My mind presageth fortunate success;
     And, Tamburlaine, my spirit doth foresee
     The utter ruin of thy men and thee.

     SOLDAN. Then rear your standards; let your sounding drums
     Direct our soldiers to Damascus' walls.--
     Now, Tamburlaine, the mighty Soldan comes,
     And leads with him the great Arabian king,
     To dim thy baseness and [222] obscurity,
     Famous for nothing but for theft and spoil;
     To raze and scatter thy inglorious crew
     Of Scythians and slavish Persians.

          [Exeunt.]




SCENE IV.

          A banquet set out; and to it come TAMBURLAINE all in
          scarlet, ZENOCRATE, THERIDAMAS, TECHELLES, USUMCASANE,
          BAJAZETH drawn in his cage, ZABINA, and others.

     TAMBURLAINE. Now hang our bloody colours by Damascus,
     Reflexing hues of blood upon their heads,
     While they walk quivering on their city-walls,
     Half-dead for fear before they feel my wrath.
     Then let us freely banquet, and carouse
     Full bowls of wine unto the god of war,
     That means to fill your helmets full of gold,
     And make Damascus' spoils as rich to you
     As was to Jason Colchos' golden fleece.--
     And now, Bajazeth, hast thou any stomach?

     BAJAZETH. Ay, such a stomach, cruel Tamburlaine, as I could
     willingly feed upon thy blood-raw heart.

     TAMBURLAINE. Nay, thine own is easier to come by:  pluck out
     that; and 'twill serve thee and thy wife.--Well, Zenocrate,
     Techelles, and the rest, fall to your victuals.

     BAJAZETH. Fall to, and never may your meat digest!--
     Ye Furies, that can mask [223] invisible,
     Dive to the bottom of Avernus' pool,
     And in your hands bring hellish poison up,
     And squeeze it in the cup of Tamburlaine!
     Or, winged snakes of Lerna, cast your stings,
     And leave your venoms in this tyrant's dish?

     ZABINA. And may this banquet prove as ominous
     As Progne's to th' adulterous Thracian king
     That fed upon the substance of his child!

     ZENOCRATE. My lord, [224] how can you suffer these
     Outrageous curses by these slaves of yours?

     TAMBURLAINE. To let them see, divine Zenocrate,
     I glory in the curses of my foes,
     Having the power from the empyreal heaven
     To turn them all upon their proper heads.

     TECHELLES. I pray you, give them leave, madam; this speech
     is a goodly refreshing for them. [225]

     THERIDAMAS. But, if his highness would let them be fed,
     it would do them more good.

     TAMBURLAINE. Sirrah, why fall you not to? are you so daintily
     brought up, you cannot eat your own flesh?

     BAJAZETH. First, legions of devils shall tear thee in pieces.

     USUMCASANE. Villain, knowest thou to whom thou speakest?

     TAMBURLAINE. O, let him alone.--Here; [226] eat, sir; take it
     from [227] my sword's point, or I'll thrust it to thy heart.

          [BAJAZETH takes the food, and stamps upon it.]

     THERIDAMAS. He stamps it under his feet, my lord.

     TAMBURLAINE. Take it up, villain, and eat it; or I will make thee
     slice [228] the brawns of thy arms into carbonadoes and eat them.

     USUMCASANE. Nay, 'twere better he killed his wife, and then she
     shall be sure not to be starved, and he be provided for a month's
     victual beforehand.

     TAMBURLAINE. Here is my dagger:  despatch her while she is fat;
     for, if she live but a while longer, she will fall [229] into a
     consumption with fretting, and then she will not be worth the
     eating.

     THERIDAMAS. Dost thou think that Mahomet will suffer this?

     TECHELLES. 'Tis like he will, when he cannot let [230] it.

     TAMBURLAINE. Go to; fall to your meat.  What, not a bit!--Belike
     he hath not been watered to-day:  give him some drink.

          [They give BAJAZETH water to drink, and he flings it on
          the ground.]

     Fast, and welcome, sir, while [231] hunger make you eat.--How now,
     Zenocrate! doth not the Turk and his wife make a goodly show at a
     banquet?

     ZENOCRATE. Yes, my lord.

     THERIDAMAS.
     Methinks 'tis a great deal better than a consort [232] of music.

     TAMBURLAINE. Yet music would do well to cheer up Zenocrate.
     Pray thee, tell why art thou so sad? if thou wilt have a song,
     the Turk shall strain his voice:  but why is it?

     ZENOCRATE. My lord, to see my father's town besieg'd,
     The country wasted where myself was born,
     How can it but afflict my very soul?
     If any love remain in you, my lord,
     Or if my love unto your majesty
     May merit favour at your highness' hands,
     Then raise your siege from fair Damascus' walls,
     And with my father take a friendly truce.

     TAMBURLAINE. Zenocrate, were Egypt Jove's own land,
     Yet would I with my sword make Jove to stoop.
     I will confute those blind geographers
     That make a triple region in the world,
     Excluding regions which I mean to trace,
     And with this pen [233] reduce them to a map,
     Calling the provinces, cities, and towns,
     After my name and thine, Zenocrate:
     Here at Damascus will I make the point
     That shall begin the perpendicular:
     And wouldst thou have me buy thy father's love
     With such a loss? tell me, Zenocrate.

     ZENOCRATE. Honour still wait on happy Tamburlaine!
     Yet give me leave to plead for him, my lord.

     TAMBURLAINE. Content thyself:  his person shall be safe,
     And all the friends of fair Zenocrate,
     If with their lives they will be pleas'd to yield,
     Or may be forc'd to make me emperor;
     For Egypt and Arabia must be mine.--
     Feed, you slave; thou mayst think thyself happy to be fed from
     my trencher.

     BAJAZETH. My empty stomach, full of idle heat,
     Draws bloody humours from my feeble parts,
     Preserving life by hastening [234] cruel death.
     My veins are pale; my sinews hard and dry;
     My joints benumb'd; unless I eat, I die.

     ZABINA. Eat, Bajazeth; let us live in spite of them, looking
     some happy power will pity and enlarge us.

     TAMBURLAINE. Here, Turk; wilt thou have a clean trencher?

     BAJAZETH. Ay, tyrant, and more meat.

     TAMBURLAINE. Soft, sir! you must be dieted; too much eating
     will make you surfeit.

     THERIDAMAS. So it would, my lord, 'specially [235] having so small
     a walk and so little exercise.

          [A second course is brought in of crowns.]

     TAMBURLAINE. Theridamas, Techelles, and Casane, here are the
     cates you desire to finger, are they not?

     THERIDAMAS. Ay, my lord:  but none save kings must feed with
     these.

     TECHELLES. 'Tis enough for us to see them, and for Tamburlaine
     only to enjoy them.

     TAMBURLAINE. Well; here is now to the Soldan of Egypt, the King
     of Arabia, and the Governor of Damascus.   Now, take these three
     crowns, and pledge me, my contributory kings.  I crown you here,
     Theridamas, king of Argier; Techelles, king of Fez; and
     Usumcasane, king of Morocco. [236]--How say you to this, Turk? these are
     not your contributory kings.

     BAJAZETH. Nor shall they long be thine, I warrant them.

     TAMBURLAINE. Kings of Argier, Morocco, and of Fez,
     You that have march'd with happy Tamburlaine
     As far as from the frozen plage [237] of heaven
     Unto the watery Morning's ruddy bower,
     And thence by land unto the torrid zone,
     Deserve these titles I endow you with
     By valour [238] and by magnanimity.
     Your births shall be no blemish to your fame;
     For virtue is the fount whence honour springs,
     And they are worthy she investeth kings.

     THERIDAMAS. And, since your highness hath so well vouchsaf'd,
     If we deserve them not with higher meeds
     Than erst our states and actions have retain'd,
     Take them away again, [239] and make us slaves.

     TAMBURLAINE. Well said, Theridamas:  when holy Fates
     Shall stablish me in strong Aegyptia,
     We mean to travel to th' antarctic pole,
     Conquering the people underneath our feet,
     And be renowm'd [240] as never emperors were.--
     Zenocrate, I will not crown thee yet,
     Until with greater honours I be grac'd.

          [Exeunt.]




ACT V.




SCENE I.

          Enter the GOVERNOR OF DAMASCUS [241] with three or four
          CITIZENS, and four VIRGINS with branches of laurel in
          their hands.

     GOVERNOR. Still doth this man, or rather god of war,
     Batter our walls and beat our turrets down;
     And to resist with longer stubbornness,
     Or hope of rescue from the Soldan's power,
     Were but to bring our wilful overthrow,
     And make us desperate of our threaten'd lives.
     We see his tents have now been altered
     With terrors to the last and cruel'st hue;
     His coal-black colours, every where advanc'd,
     Threaten our city with a general spoil;
     And, if we should with common rites of arms
     Offer our safeties to his clemency,
     I fear the custom proper to his sword,
     Which he observes as parcel of his fame,
     Intending so to terrify the world,
     By any innovation or remorse [242]
     Will never be dispens'd with till our deaths.
     Therefore, for these our harmless virgins' sakes, [243]
     Whose honours and whose lives rely on him,
     Let us have hope that their unspotted prayers,
     Their blubber'd [244] cheeks, and hearty humble moans,
     Will melt his fury into some remorse,
     And use us like a loving conqueror. [245]

     FIRST VIRGIN. If humble suite or imprecations
     (Utter'd with tears of wretchedness and blood
     Shed from the heads and hearts of all our sex,
     Some made your wives, and some your children,)
     Might have entreated your obdurate breasts
     To entertain some care [246] of our securities
     Whiles only danger beat upon our walls,
     These more than dangerous warrants of our death
     Had never been erected as they be,
     Nor you depend on such weak helps [247] as we.

     GOVERNOR. Well, lovely virgins, think our country's care,
     Our love of honour, loath to be enthrall'd
     To foreign powers and rough imperious yokes,
     Would not with too much cowardice or [248] fear,
     Before all hope of rescue were denied,
     Submit yourselves and us to servitude.
     Therefore, in that your safeties and our own,
     Your honours, liberties, and lives were weigh'd
     In equal care and balance with our own,
     Endure as we the malice of our stars,
     The wrath of Tamburlaine and power [249] of wars;
     Or be the means the overweighing heavens
     Have kept to qualify these hot extremes,
     And bring us pardon in your cheerful looks.

     SECOND VIRGIN. Then here, before the Majesty of Heaven
     And holy patrons of Aegyptia,
     With knees and hearts submissive we entreat
     Grace to our words and pity to our looks,
     That this device may prove propitious,
     And through the eyes and ears of Tamburlaine
     Convey events of mercy to his heart;
     Grant that these signs of victory we yield
     May bind the temples of his conquering head,
     To hide the folded furrows of his brows,
     And shadow his displeased countenance
     With happy looks of ruth and lenity.
     Leave us, my lord, and loving countrymen:
     What simple virgins may persuade, we will.

     GOVERNOR. Farewell, sweet virgins, on whose safe return
     Depends our city, liberty, and lives.

          [Exeunt all except the VIRGINS.]

          Enter TAMBURLAINE, all in black and very melancholy,
          TECHELLES, THERIDAMAS, USUMCASANE, with others.

     TAMBURLAINE. What, are the turtles fray'd out of their nests?
     Alas, poor fools, must you be first shall feel
     The sworn destruction of Damascus?
     They knew [250] my custom; could they not as well
     Have sent ye out when first my milk-white flags,
     Through which sweet Mercy threw her gentle beams,
     Reflexed [251] them on their [252] disdainful eyes,
     As [253] now when fury and incensed hate
     Flings slaughtering terror from my coal-black tents, [254]
     And tells for truth submission [255] comes too late?

     FIRST VIRGIN. Most happy king and emperor of the earth,
     Image of honour and nobility,
     For whom the powers divine have made the world,
     And on whose throne the holy Graces sit;
     In whose sweet person is compris'd the sum
     Of Nature's skill and heavenly majesty;
     Pity our plights!  O, pity poor Damascus!
     Pity old age, within whose silver hairs
     Honour and reverence evermore have reign'd!
     Pity the marriage-bed, where many a lord,
     In prime and glory of his loving joy,
     Embraceth now with tears of ruth and [256] blood
     The jealous body of his fearful wife,
     Whose cheeks and hearts, so punish'd with conceit, [257]
     To think thy puissant never-stayed arm
     Will part their bodies, and prevent their souls
     From heavens of comfort yet their age might bear,
     Now wax all pale and wither'd to the death,
     As well for grief our ruthless governor
     Hath [258] thus refus'd the mercy of thy hand,
     (Whose sceptre angels kiss and Furies dread,)
     As for their liberties, their loves, or lives!
     O, then, for these, and such as we ourselves,
     For us, for infants, and for all our bloods,
     That never nourish'd [259] thought against thy rule,
     Pity, O, pity, sacred emperor,
     The prostrate service of this wretched town;
     And take in sign thereof this gilded wreath,
     Whereto each man of rule hath given his hand,
     And wish'd, [260] as worthy subjects, happy means
     To be investers of thy royal brows
     Even with the true Egyptian diadem!

     TAMBURLAINE. Virgins, in vain you labour to prevent
     That which mine honour swears shall be perform'd.
     Behold my sword; what see you at the point?

     FIRST VIRGIN. Nothing but fear and fatal steel, my lord.

     TAMBURLAINE. Your fearful minds are thick and misty, then,
     For there sits Death; there sits imperious [261] Death,
     Keeping his circuit by the slicing edge.
     But I am pleas'd you shall not see him there;
     He now is seated on my horsemen's spears,
     And on their points his fleshless body feeds.--
     Techelles, straight go charge a few of them
     To charge these dames, and shew my servant Death,
     Sitting in scarlet on their armed spears.

     VIRGINS. O, pity us!

     TAMBURLAINE. Away with them, I say, and shew them Death!
          [The VIRGINS are taken out by TECHELLES and others.]
     I will not spare these proud Egyptians,
     Nor change my martial observations
     For all the wealth of Gihon's golden waves,
     Or for the love of Venus, would she leave
     The angry god of arms and lie with me.
     They have refus'd the offer of their lives,
     And know my customs are as peremptory
     As wrathful planets, death, or destiny.

          Re-enter TECHELLES.

     What, have your horsemen shown the virgins Death?

     TECHELLES. They have, my lord, and on Damascus' walls
     Have hoisted up their slaughter'd carcasses.

     TAMBURLAINE. A sight as baneful to their souls, I think,
     As are Thessalian drugs or mithridate:
     But go, my lords, put the rest to the sword.

          [Exeunt all except TAMBURLAINE.]

     Ah, fair Zenocrate!--divine Zenocrate!
     Fair is too foul an epithet for thee,--
     That in thy passion [262] for thy country's love,
     And fear to see thy kingly father's harm,
     With hair dishevell'd wip'st thy watery cheeks;
     And, like to Flora in her morning's pride,
     Shaking her silver tresses in the air,
     Rain'st on the earth resolved [263] pearl in showers,
     And sprinklest sapphires on thy shining face,
     Where Beauty, mother to the Muses, sits,
     And comments volumes with her ivory pen,
     Taking instructions from thy flowing eyes;
     Eyes, when that Ebena steps to heaven, [264]
     In silence of thy solemn evening's walk,
     Making the mantle of the richest night,
     The moon, the planets, and the meteors, light;
     There angels in their crystal armours fight [265]
     A doubtful battle with my tempted thoughts
     For Egypt's freedom and the Soldan's life,
     His life that so consumes Zenocrate;
     Whose sorrows lay more siege unto my soul
     Than all my army to Damascus' walls;
     And neither Persia's [266] sovereign nor the Turk
     Troubled my senses with conceit of foil
     So much by much as doth Zenocrate.
     What is beauty, saith my sufferings, then?
     If all the pens that ever poets held
     Had fed the feeling of their masters' thoughts,
     And every sweetness that inspir'd their hearts,
     Their minds, and muses on admired themes;
     If all the heavenly quintessence they still [267]
     From their immortal flowers of poesy,
     Wherein, as in a mirror, we perceive
     The highest reaches of a human wit;
     If these had made one poem's period,
     And all combin'd in beauty's worthiness,
     Yet should there hover in their restless heads
     One thought, one grace, one wonder, at the least,
     Which into words no virtue can digest.
     But how unseemly is it for my sex,
     My discipline of arms and chivalry,
     My nature, and the terror of my name,
     To harbour thoughts effeminate and faint!
     Save only that in beauty's just applause,
     With whose instinct the soul of man is touch'd;
     And every warrior that is rapt with love
     Of fame, of valour, and of victory,
     Must needs have beauty beat on his conceits:
     I thus conceiving, [268] and subduing both,
     That which hath stoop'd the chiefest of the gods,
     Even from the fiery-spangled veil of heaven,
     To feel the lovely warmth of shepherds' flames,
     And mask in cottages of strowed reeds,
     Shall give the world to note, for all my birth,
     That virtue solely is the sum of glory,
     And fashions men with true nobility.--
     Who's within there?

          Enter ATTENDANTS.

     Hath Bajazeth been fed to-day?

     ATTEND. [269] Ay, my lord.

     TAMBURLAINE. Bring him forth; and let us know if the town be
     ransacked.

          [Exeunt ATTENDANTS.]

          Enter TECHELLES, THERIDAMAS, USUMCASANE, and others.

     TECHELLES. The town is ours, my lord, and fresh supply
     Of conquest and of spoil is offer'd us.

     TAMBURLAINE. That's well, Techelles.  What's the news?

     TECHELLES. The Soldan and the Arabian king together
     March on us with [270] such eager violence
     As if there were no way but one with us. [271]

     TAMBURLAINE. No more there is not, I warrant thee, Techelles.

          ATTENDANTS bring in BAJAZETH in his cage, followed by
          ZABINA.
          Exeunt ATTENDANTS.

     THERIDAMAS. We know the victory is ours, my lord;
     But let us save the reverend Soldan's life
     For fair Zenocrate that so laments his state.

     TAMBURLAINE. That will we chiefly see unto, Theridamas,
     For sweet Zenocrate, whose worthiness
     Deserves a conquest over every heart.--
     And now, my footstool, if I lose the field,
     You hope of liberty and restitution?--
     Here let him stay, my masters, from the tents,
     Till we have made us ready for the field.--
     Pray for us, Bajazeth; we are going.
          [Exeunt all except BAJAZETH and ZABINA.]

     BAJAZETH. Go, never to return with victory!
     Millions of men encompass thee about,
     And gore thy body with as many wounds!
     Sharp forked arrows light upon thy horse!
     Furies from the black Cocytus' lake,
     Break up the earth, and with their fire-brands
     Enforce thee run upon the baneful pikes!
     Vollies of shot pierce through thy charmed skin,
     And every bullet dipt in poison'd drugs!
     Or roaring cannons sever all thy joints,
     Making thee mount as high as eagles soar!

     ZABINA. Let all the swords and lances in the field
     Stick in his breast as in their proper rooms!
     At every pore [272] let blood come dropping forth,
     That lingering pains may massacre his heart,
     And madness send his damned soul to hell!

     BAJAZETH. Ah, fair Zabina! we may curse his power,
     The heavens may frown, the earth for anger quake;
     But such a star hath influence in [273] his sword
     As rules the skies and countermands the gods
     More than Cimmerian Styx or Destiny:
     And then shall we in this detested guise,
     With shame, with hunger, and with horror stay, [274]
     Griping our bowels with retorqued [275] thoughts,
     And have no hope to end our ecstasies.

     ZABINA. Then is there left no Mahomet, no God,
     No fiend, no fortune, nor no hope of end
     To our infamous, monstrous slaveries.
     Gape, earth, and let the fiends infernal view
     A [276] hell as hopeless and as full of fear
     As are the blasted banks of Erebus,
     Where shaking ghosts with ever-howling groans
     Hover about the ugly ferryman,
     To get a passage to Elysium! [277]
     Why should we live?--O, wretches, beggars, slaves!--
     Why live we, Bajazeth, and build up nests
     So high within the region of the air,
     By living long in this oppression,
     That all the world will see and laugh to scorn
     The former triumphs of our mightiness
     In this obscure infernal servitude?

     BAJAZETH. O life, more loathsome to my vexed thoughts [278]
     Than noisome parbreak [279] of the Stygian snakes,
     Which fills the nooks of hell with standing air,
     Infecting all the ghosts with cureless griefs!
     O dreary engines of my loathed sight,
     That see my crown, my honour, and my name
     Thrust under yoke and thraldom of a thief,
     Why feed ye still on day's accursed beams,
     And sink not quite into my tortur'd soul?
     You see my wife, my queen, and emperess,
     Brought up and propped by the hand of Fame,
     Queen of fifteen contributory queens,
     Now thrown to rooms of black abjection, [280]
     Smeared with blots of basest drudgery,
     And villainess [281] to shame, disdain, and misery.
     Accursed Bajazeth, whose words of ruth, [282]
     That would with pity cheer Zabina's heart,
     And make our souls resolve [283] in ceaseless tears,
     Sharp hunger bites upon and gripes the root
     From whence the issues of my thoughts do break!
     O poor Zabina!  O my queen, my queen!
     Fetch me some water for my burning breast,
     To cool and comfort me with longer date,
     That, in the shorten'd sequel of my life,
     I may pour forth my soul into thine arms
     With words of love, whose moaning intercourse
     Hath hitherto been stay'd with wrath and hate
     Of our expressless bann'd [284] inflictions.

     ZABINA. Sweet Bajazeth, I will prolong thy life
     As long as any blood or spark of breath
     Can quench or cool the torments of my grief.

          [Exit.]

     BAJAZETH. Now, Bajazeth, abridge thy baneful days,
     And beat the [285] brains out of thy conquer'd head,
     Since other means are all forbidden me,
     That may be ministers of my decay.
     O highest lamp of ever-living [286] Jove,
     Accursed day, infected with my griefs,
     Hide now thy stained face in endless night,
     And shut the windows of the lightsome heavens!
     Let ugly Darkness with her rusty coach,
     Engirt with tempests, wrapt in pitchy clouds,
     Smother the earth with never-fading mists,
     And let her horses from their nostrils breathe
     Rebellious winds and dreadful thunder-claps,
     That in this terror Tamburlaine may live,
     And my pin'd soul, resolv'd in liquid air,
     May still excruciate his tormented thoughts!
     Then let the stony dart of senseless cold
     Pierce through the centre of my wither'd heart,
     And make a passage for my loathed life!

          [He brains himself against the cage.]

          Re-enter ZABINA.

     ZABINA. What do mine eyes behold? my husband dead!
     His skull all riven in twain! his brains dash'd out,
     The brains of Bajazeth, my lord and sovereign!
     O Bajazeth, my husband and my lord!
     O Bajazeth!  O Turk!  O emperor!
     Give him his liquor? not I.  Bring milk and fire, and my blood
     I bring him again.--Tear me in pieces--give [287] me the sword
     with a ball of wild-fire upon it.--Down with him! down with
     him!--Go to my child; away, away, away! ah, save that infant!
     save him, save him!--I, even I, speak to her. [288]--The sun was
     down--streamers white, red, black--Here, here, here!--Fling the
     meat in his face--Tamburlaine, Tamburlaine!--Let the soldiers be
     buried.--Hell, death, Tamburlaine, [289] hell!--Make ready my
     coach, [290] my chair, my jewels.--I come, I come, I come! [291]

          [She runs against the cage, and brains herself.]

          Enter ZENOCRATE with ANIPPE.

     ZENOCRATE. Wretched Zenocrate! that liv'st to see
     Damascus' walls dy'd with Egyptians' [292] blood,
     Thy father's subjects and thy countrymen;
     The [293] streets strow'd with dissever'd joints of men,
     And wounded bodies gasping yet for life;
     But most accurs'd, to see the sun-bright troop
     Of heavenly virgins and unspotted maids
     (Whose looks might make the angry god of arms
     To break his sword and mildly treat of love)
     On horsemen's lances to be hoisted up,
     And guiltlessly endure a cruel death;
     For every fell and stout Tartarian steed,
     That stamp'd on others with their thundering hoofs,
     When all their riders charg'd their quivering spears,
     Began to check the ground and rein themselves,
     Gazing upon the beauty of their looks.
     Ah, Tamburlaine, wert thou the cause of this,
     That term'st Zenocrate thy dearest love?
     Whose lives were dearer to Zenocrate
     Than her own life, or aught save thine own love.
     But see, another bloody spectacle!
     Ah, wretched eyes, the enemies of my heart,
     How are ye glutted with these grievous objects,
     And tell my soul more tales of bleeding ruth!--
     See, see, Anippe, if they breathe or no.

     ANIPPE. No breath, nor sense, nor motion, in them both:
     Ah, madam, this their slavery hath enforc'd,
     And ruthless cruelty of Tamburlaine!

     ZENOCRATE. Earth, cast up fountains from thy [294] entrails,
     And wet thy cheeks for their untimely deaths;
     Shake with their weight in sign of fear and grief!
     Blush, heaven, that gave them honour at their birth,
     And let them die a death so barbarous!
     Those that are proud of fickle empery
     And place their chiefest good in earthly pomp,
     Behold the Turk and his great emperess!
     Ah, Tamburlaine my love, sweet Tamburlaine,
     That fight'st for sceptres and for slippery crowns,
     Behold the Turk and his great emperess!
     Thou that, in conduct of thy happy stars,
     Sleep'st every night with conquest on thy brows,
     And yet wouldst shun the wavering turns of war, [295]
     In fear and feeling of the like distress
     Behold the Turk and his great emperess!
     Ah, mighty Jove and holy Mahomet,
     Pardon my love!  O, pardon his contempt
     Of earthly fortune and respect of pity;
     And let not conquest, ruthlessly pursu'd,
     Be equally against his life incens'd
     In this great Turk and hapless emperess!
     And pardon me that was not mov'd with ruth
     To see them live so long in misery!--
     Ah, what may chance to thee, Zenocrate?

     ANIPPE. Madam, content yourself, and be resolv'd
     Your love hath Fortune so at his command,
     That she shall stay, and turn her wheel no more,
     As long as life maintains his mighty arm
     That fights for honour to adorn your head.

          Enter PHILEMUS.

     ZENOCRATE. What other heavy news now brings Philemus?

     PHILEMUS. Madam, your father, and the Arabian king,
     The first affecter of your excellence,
     Come [296] now, as Turnus 'gainst Aeneas did,
     Armed [297] with lance into the Aegyptian fields,
     Ready for battle 'gainst my lord the king.

     ZENOCRATE. Now shame and duty, love and fear present
     A thousand sorrows to my martyr'd soul.
     Whom should I wish the fatal victory,
     When my poor pleasures are divided thus,
     And rack'd by duty from my cursed heart?
     My father and my first-betrothed love
     Must fight against my life and present love;
     Wherein the change I use condemns my faith,
     And makes my deeds infamous through the world:
     But, as the gods, to end the Trojans' toil,
     Prevented Turnus of Lavinia,
     And fatally enrich'd Aeneas' love,
     So, for a final [298] issue to my griefs,
     To pacify my country and my love,
     Must Tamburlaine by their resistless powers,
     With virtue of a gentle victory,
     Conclude a league of honour to my hope;
     Then, as the powers divine have pre-ordain'd,
     With happy safety of my father's life
     Send like defence of fair Arabia

          [They sound to the battle within; and TAMBURLAINE enjoys
          the victory:  after which, the KING OF ARABIA [299] enters
          wounded.]

     KING OF ARABIA. What cursed power guides the murdering hands
     Of this infamous tyrant's soldiers,
     That no escape may save their enemies,
     Nor fortune keep themselves from victory?
     Lie down, Arabia, wounded to the death,
     And let Zenocrate's fair eyes behold,
     That, as for her thou bear'st these wretched arms,
     Even so for her thou diest in these arms,
     Leaving thy [300] blood for witness of thy love.

     ZENOCRATE. Too dear a witness for such love, my lord!
     Behold Zenocrate, the cursed object
     Whose fortunes never mastered her griefs;
     Behold her wounded in conceit [301] for thee,
     As much as thy fair body is for me!

     KING OF ARABIA. Then shall I die with full contented heart,
     Having beheld divine Zenocrate,
     Whose sight with joy would take away my life
     As now it bringeth sweetness to my wound,
     If I had not been wounded as I am.
     Ah, that the deadly pangs I suffer now
     Would lend an hour's licence to my tongue,
     To make discourse of some sweet accidents
     Have chanc'd thy merits in this worthless bondage,
     And that I might be privy to the state
     Of thy deserv'd contentment and thy love!
     But, making now a virtue of thy sight,
     To drive all sorrow from my fainting soul,
     Since death denies me further cause of joy,
     Depriv'd of care, my heart with comfort dies,
     Since thy desired hand shall close mine eyes.

          [Dies.]

          Re-enter TAMBURLAINE, leading the SOLDAN; TECHELLES,
          THERIDAMAS, USUMCASANE, with others.

     TAMBURLAINE. Come, happy father of Zenocrate,
     A title higher than thy Soldan's name.
     Though my right hand have [302] thus enthralled thee,
     Thy princely daughter here shall set thee free;
     She that hath calm'd the fury of my sword,
     Which had ere this been bath'd in streams of blood
     As vast and deep as Euphrates [303] or Nile.

     ZENOCRATE. O sight thrice-welcome to my joyful soul,
     To see the king, my father, issue safe
     From dangerous battle of my conquering love!

     SOLDAN. Well met, my only dear Zenocrate,
     Though with the loss of Egypt and my crown!

     TAMBURLAINE. 'Twas I, my lord, that gat the victory;
     And therefore grieve not at your overthrow,
     Since I shall render all into your hands,
     And add more strength to your dominions
     Than ever yet confirm'd th' Egyptian crown.
     The god of war resigns his room to me,
     Meaning to make me general of the world:
     Jove, viewing me in arms, looks pale and wan,
     Fearing my power should [304] pull him from his throne:
     Where'er I come the Fatal Sisters sweat, [305]
     And grisly Death, by running to and fro,
     To do their ceaseless homage to my sword:
     And here in Afric, where it seldom rains,
     Since I arriv'd with my triumphant host,
     Have swelling clouds, drawn from wide-gaping [306] wounds,
     Been oft resolv'd [307] in bloody purple showers,
     A meteor that might terrify the earth,
     And make it quake at every drop it drinks:
     Millions [308] of souls sit on the banks of Styx,
     Waiting the back-return of Charon's boat;
     Hell and Elysium [309] swarm with ghosts of men
     That I have sent from sundry foughten fields
     To spread my fame through hell and up to heaven:
     And see, my lord, a sight of strange import,--
     Emperors and kings lie breathless at my feet;
     The Turk and his great empress, as it seems,
     Left to themselves while we were at the fight,
     Have desperately despatch'd their slavish lives:
     With them Arabia, too, hath left his life:
     All sights of power to grace my victory;
     And such are objects fit for Tamburlaine,
     Wherein, as in a mirror, may be seen
     His honour, that consists in shedding blood
     When men presume to manage arms with him.

     SOLDAN. Mighty hath God and Mahomet made thy hand,
     Renowmed [310] Tamburlaine, to whom all kings
     Of force must yield their crowns and emperies;
     And I am pleas'd with this my overthrow,
     If, as beseems a person of thy state,
     Thou hast with honour us'd Zenocrate.

     TAMBURLAINE. Her state and person want no pomp, you see;
     And for all blot of foul inchastity,
     I record [311] heaven, her heavenly self is clear:
     Then let me find no further time [312] to grace
     Her princely temples with the Persian crown;
     But here these kings that on my fortunes wait,
     And have been crown'd for proved worthiness
     Even by this hand that shall establish them,
     Shall now, adjoining all their hands with mine,
     Invest her here the [313] Queen of Persia
     What saith the noble Soldan, and Zenocrate?

     SOLDAN. I yield with thanks and protestations
     Of endless honour to thee for her love.

     TAMBURLAINE. Then doubt I not [314] but fair Zenocrate
     Will soon consent to satisfy us both.

     ZENOCRATE. Else [315] should I much forget myself, my lord.

     THERIDAMAS. Then let us set the crown upon her head,
     That long hath linger'd for so high a seat.

     TECHELLES. My hand is ready to perform the deed;
     For now her marriage-time shall work us rest.

     USUMCASANE. And here's the crown, my lord; help set it on. [316]

     TAMBURLAINE. Then sit thou down, divine Zenocrate;
     And here we crown thee Queen of Persia,
     And all the kingdoms and dominions
     That late the power of Tamburlaine subdu'd.
     As Juno, when the giants were suppress'd,
     That darted mountains at her brother Jove,
     So looks my love, shadowing in her brows
     Triumphs and trophies for my victories;
     Or as Latona's daughter, bent to arms,
     Adding more courage to my conquering mind.
     To gratify the[e], sweet Zenocrate,
     Egyptians, Moors, and men of Asia,
     From Barbary unto the Western India,
     Shall pay a yearly tribute to thy sire;
     And from the bounds of Afric to the banks
     Of Ganges shall his mighty arm extend.--
     And now, my lords and loving followers,
     That purchas'd kingdoms by your martial deeds,
     Cast off your armour, put on scarlet robes,
     Mount up your royal places of estate,
     Environed with troops of noblemen,
     And there make laws to rule your provinces:
     Hang up your weapons on Alcides' post[s];
     For Tamburlaine takes truce with all the world.--
     Thy first-betrothed love, Arabia,
     Shall we with honour, as beseems, [317] entomb
     With this great Turk and his fair emperess.
     Then, after all these solemn exequies,
     We will our rites [318] of marriage solemnize.

          [Exeunt.]






FOOTNOTES:

[Footnote 1: To the Gentlemen-readers, &c.] From the 8vo of 1592:  in the
4tos this address is worded here and there differently.  I have
not thought it necessary to mark the varioe lectiones of the
worthy printer's composition.]

[Footnote 2: histories] i.e. dramas so called,--plays founded on history.]

[Footnote 3: fond] i.e. foolish.--Concerning the omissions here alluded
to, some remarks will be found in the ACCOUNT OF MARLOWE AND
HIS WRITINGS.]

   The "Account of Marlowe and His Writings," is the
     introduction to this book of 'The Works of Christopher
     Marlowe.'  That is, the book from which this play has been
     transcribed.  The following is from pages xvi and xvii of
     that introduction.

   "This tragedy, which was entered in the Stationers' Books,
     14th August, 1590,[a] and printed during the same year, has
     not come down to us in its original fulness; and probably we
     have no cause to lament the curtailments which it suffered
     from the publisher of the first edition.  "I have
     purposely,"
     he says, "omitted and left out some fond and frivolous
     gestures, digressing, and, in my poor opinion, far unmeet
     for the matter, which I thought might seem more tedious unto
     the wise than any way else to be regarded, though haply they
     have been of some vain-conceited fondlings greatly gaped at,
     what time they were shewed upon the stage in their graced
     deformities:  nevertheless now to be mixtured in print with
     such matter of worth, it would prove a great disgrace to so
     honourable and stately a history."[b]  By the words, "fond
     and frivolous gestures," we are to understand those of the
     "clown;" who very frequently figured, with more or less
     prominence, even in the most serious dramas of the time.
     The introduction of such buffooneries into tragedy[c] is
     censured by Hall towards the conclusion of a passage which,
     as it mentions "the Turkish Tamberlaine," would seem to be
     partly levelled at Marlowe:[d]

       "One higher-pitch'd doth set his soaring thought
        On crowned kings that Fortune hath low brought,
        Or some vpreared high-aspiring swaine,
        As it might be THE TURKISH TAMBERLAINE.
        Then weeneth he his base drink-drowned spright
        Rapt to the three-fold loft of heauen hight,
        When he conceiues vpon his fained stage
        The stalking steps of his greate personage,
        Graced with huf-cap termes and thundring threats,
        That his poore hearers' hayre quite vpright sets.

                * * * * * * * * *

        NOW, LEAST SUCH FRIGHTFULL SHOWES OF FORTUNE'S FALL
        AND BLOUDY TYRANTS' RAGE SHOULD CHANCE APALL
        THE DEAD-STROKE AUDIENCE, MIDST THE SILENT ROUT
        COMES LEAPING IN A SELFE-MISFORMED LOUT,
        AND LAUGHES, AND GRINS, AND FRAMES HIS MIMIK FACE,
        AND IUSTLES STRAIGHT INTO THE PRINCE'S PLACE:
        THEN DOTH THE THEATRE ECCHO ALL ALOUD
        WITH GLADSOME NOYSE OF THAT APPLAUDING CROWD:
        A GOODLY HOCH-POCH, WHEN VILE RUSSETTINGS
        ARE MATCH['D] WITH MONARCHS AND WITH MIGHTIE KINGS!"[e]

     But Hall's taste was more refined and classical than that
     of his age; and the success of TAMBURLAINE, in which the
     celebrated Alleyn represented the hero,[f] was adequate to
     the most sanguine expectations which its author could have
     formed.]

    [a] "A ballad entituled the storye of Tamburlayne the
         greate," &c. (founded, I suppose, on Marlowe's play)
         was entered in the Stationers' Books, 5th Nov. 1594.

    [b] P. 4 of the present volume.

    [c] In Italy, at the commencement of the 18th century
         (and probably much later), it was not unusual to
         introduce "the Doctor," "Harlequin," "Pantalone," and
         "Coviello," into deep tragedies.  "I have seen," says
         Addison, "a translation of THE CID acted at Bolonia,
         which would never have taken, had they not found a
         place in it for these buffoons." REMARKS ON SEVERAL
         PARTS OF ITALY, &C. IN THE YEARS 1701, 1702, 1703,
         p. 68, ed. 1745.

    [d] Perhaps I ought to add, that Marlowe was dead when
         (in 1597) the satire, from which these lines are quoted,
         was first given to the press.

[Footnote 81: Sprung] Here, and in the next speech, both the old eds.
"Sprong":  but in p. 18, l. 3, first col., the 4to has "sprung",
and in the SEC. PART of the play, act iv. sc. 4, they both give
"SPRUNG from a tyrants loynes."

[Footnote 95: into] Used here (as the word was formerly often used) for
UNTO.]

[Footnote 96: sure] A dissyllable here.  In the next line "assure" is a
trisyllable.]

[Footnote 97: with his crown in his hand] The old eds. add "offering
to hide it;" but THAT he does presently after.]

[Footnote 98: those were] i.e. those who were, who have been.]

[Footnote 99: Stand staggering] So the 8vo.--The 4to "Stand THOSE

[Footnote 100: For kings are clouts that every man shoots at,

      Our crown the pin, &c.

CLOUT means the white mark in the butts; PIN, the peg in the

[Footnote 121: Resolve] Seems to mean--dissolve (compare "our bodies turn
to elements," p. 12, sec. col.):  but I suspect some corruption
here.

   "TAMBURLAINE. . . . .
    Until our bodies turn to elements,
    And both our souls aspire celestial thrones.--"
    etc.]]

[Footnote 122: Barbarous] Qy. "O barbarous"? in the next line but one,
"O treacherous"? and in the last line of the speech, "O bloody"?
But we occasionally find in our early dramatists lines which are
defective in the first syllable; and in some of these instances
at least it would almost seem that nothing has been omitted by
the transcriber or printer.]

[Footnote 123: artier] i.e. artery.  This form occurs again in the SEC.
PART of the present play:  so too in a copy of verses by Day;]

   "Hid in the vaines and ARTIERS of the earthe."
        SHAKESPEARE SOC. PAPERS, vol. i. 19.

The word indeed was variously written of old:

   "The ARTER strynge is the conduyt of the lyfe spiryte."
        Hormanni VULGARIA, sig. G iii. ed. 1530.

   "Riche treasures serue for th'ARTERS of the war."

[Footnote 125: fruit] So the 4to.--The 8vo "fruites."]

[Footnote 126: are] Old eds. "Is."]

[Footnote 127: talents] Was often used by our early writers for TALONS,
as many passages might be adduced to shew.  Hence the quibble in
Shakespeare's LOVE'S LABOUR<K\OST, act iv. sc. 2., "If a TALENT
be a claw," &c.]

[Footnote 128: harpy] So the 8vo.--The 4to "Harper;" and with that
reading the line is cited, in a note on MACBETH, act iv. sc. 1,
by Steevens, who also gives "tires UPON my life;" but "TIRES"
(a well-known term in falconry, and equivalent here to--preys)
is to be pronounced as a dissyllable.  (In the 4to it in spelt
"tyers."]

[Footnote 131: Christians renied] i.e. Christians who have denied, or
renounced their faith.--In THE GENT. MAGAZINE for Jan. 1841,
J. M. would read "Christians RENEGADENS" or "CHRISTIAN
RENEGADES:"

but the old text is right; among many passages that might be
cited, compare the following;

   "And that Ydole is the God of false Cristene, that han
    RENEYED hire FEYTHE."
        THE VOIAGE AND TRAVAILE OF SIR JOHN MAUNDEVILE,

[Footnote 162: Morocco] Here the old eds. "Moroccus,"--a barbarism which
I have not retained, because previously, in the stage-direction
at the commencement of this act, p. 19, they agree in reading
"Morocco."]

[Footnote 163: titles] So the 8vo.--The 4to "title."]

[Footnote 164: sarell] i.e. seraglio.]

[Footnote 165: I'll] So the 8vo.--The 4to "I will."]

[Footnote 174: them] Old eds. "thee."]

[Footnote 175: the] Has perhaps crept in by a mistake of the transcriber
or printer.]

[Footnote 176: And make your strokes to wound the senseless light] The
old eds. have,

   "And make OUR strokes to wound the sencelesse LURE."

(the last word being, perhaps, in the 8vo "lute.") Here "light"
is a very questionable reading:  qy. "air"? (though the third
line above ends with that word).)]

[Footnote 177: boss] In the GENT. MAG. for Jan. 1841, J. M. proposed
to alter "boss" to "Bassa."  But Cotgrave, in his DICT., has;
"A fat BOSSE. Femme bien grasse et grosse; une coche."]

have,

   "Bajazeth flies, and he pursues him.  The battell short
  (Qto. is short), and they enter, Bajazeth is ouercome."

This not very intelligible stage-direction means perhaps that,
after Bajazeth and Tamburlaine had entered, a short combat was
to take place between them.]

mouth of Judas, in Fletcher's BONDUCA, at the commencement of
act ii.; and in Fletcher's WIT WITHOUT MONEY, act v. sc. 2. we
find "thou man of Memphis."]

[Footnote 187: basilisks] Pieces of ordnance so called.  They were of
immense size; see Douce's ILLUST. OF SHAKESPEARE, i. 425.]

    Lay me STARK NAK'D, and let the water-flies

SECOND PART of this play, act ii. sc. 4, we have, according to
the 8vo--

   "And here will I set up her STATURE."

and, among many passages that might be cited from our early
authors, compare the following;

   "The STATURES huge, of Porphyrie and costlier matters made."
        Warner's ALBIONS ENGLAND, p. 303. ed. 1596.

   "By them shal Isis STATURE gently stand."

the lines (p. 27, sec. col.),--

   "The golden stature of their feather'd bird,
    That spreads her wings upon the city-walls";

and it is well known to have been a sacred bird among the
Egyptians (see Cicero DE NAT. DEORUM, I. 36).  Compare the old
play of THE TAMING OF A SHREW;

   "Father, I SWEARE BY IBIS' GOLDEN BEAKE,
    More faire and radiente is my bonie Kate
    Then siluer Zanthus," &c.
        p. 22. ed. Shakespeare Soc.

[Footnote 244: blubber'd] That this word formerly conveyed no ludicrous
idea, appears from many passages of our early writers.]

[Footnote 263: resolved] i.e. dissolved.]

[Footnote 264: Eyes, when that Ebena steps to heaven, &c.] Either the
transcriber or the printer has made sad work with this
passage; nor am I able to suggest any probable emendation.]

[Footnote 265: fight] So the 8vo.--The 4to "fights."]

[Footnote 266: Persia's] Old eds. "Perseans," and "Persians."]

[Footnote 267: still] i.e. distil.]

[Footnote 268: I thus conceiving, and subduing both,
That which hath stoop'd the chiefest of the gods,

And mask in cottages of strowed reeds, &c.

i.e. I thus feeling, and also subduing, the power of Beauty,
which has drawn down the chiefest of the gods even from, &c.

The 8vo has,
   "I thus conceiuing and subduing both.
    That which hath STOPT the TEMPEST of the Gods,
    Euen from the fiery spangled vaile of heauen,
    To feele the louely warmth of shepheards flames,

    Euen from the SPANGLED FIRIE vaile of heauen,
    To feele the louely warmth of Shepheardes flames,
    And MARCH in COATCHES of strowed WEEDES," &c.

The alterations which I have made in this corrupted passage are
supported by the following lines of the play;

   "See now, ye slaves, my children STOOP YOUR PRIDE (i.e. make
      your pride to stoop),
    And lead your bodies sheep-like to the sword."
        Part Second,--act iv. sc. 1.

   "The chiefest god, FIRST MOVER OF THAT SPHERE", &c.
        Part First,--act iv. sc. 2.

   "Jove SOMETIME masked IN A SHEPHERD'S WEED", &c.
        Part First,--act i. sc. 2.

Perhaps in the third line of the present passage "fiery-spangled"
should be "FIRE-YSPANGLED."]

modern editors understand as "Anippe" (the waiting-maid of
Zenocrate).]

THE JEW OF MALTA.



By Christopher Marlowe

Edited By The Rev. Alexander Dyce.



The Famous Tragedy of The Rich Iew of Malta.  As it was playd before the
King and Qveene, in His Majesties Theatre at White-Hall, by her
Majesties Servants at the Cock-pit.  Written by Christopher Marlo.
London; Printed by I. B. for Nicholas Vavasour, and are to be sold at
his Shop in the Inner-Temple, neere the Church.  1633.  4to.



TO MY WORTHY FRIEND, MASTER THOMAS HAMMON, of GRAY'S INN, ETC.

This play, composed by so worthy an author as Master Marlowe, and the
part of the Jew presented by so unimitable an actor as Master Alleyn,
being in this later age commended to the stage; as I ushered it unto the
court, and presented it to the Cock-pit, with these Prologues and
Epilogues here inserted, so now being newly brought to the press, I was
loath it should be published without the ornament of an Epistle; making
choice of you unto whom to devote it; than whom (of all those gentlemen
and acquaintance within the compass of my long knowledge) there is none
more able to tax ignorance, or attribute right to merit. Sir, you have
been pleased to grace some of mine own works [1] with your courteous
patronage:  I hope this will not be the worse accepted, because
commended by me; over whom none can claim more power or privilege than
yourself.  I had no better a new-year's gift to present you with;
receive it therefore as a continuance of that inviolable obligement, by
which he rests still engaged, who, as he ever hath, shall always remain,

     Tuissimus,
          Tho. Heywood. [2]





THE PROLOGUE SPOKEN AT COURT.

     Gracious and great, that we so boldly dare
     ('Mongst other plays that now in fashion are)
     To present this, writ many years agone,
     And in that age thought second unto none,
     We humbly crave your pardon.  We pursue
     The story of a rich and famous Jew
     Who liv'd in Malta:  you shall find him still,
     In all his projects, a sound Machiavill;
     And that's his character.  He that hath past
     So many censures [3] is now come at last
     To have your princely ears:  grace you him; then
     You crown the action, and renown the pen.




EPILOGUE SPOKEN AT COURT.

     It is our fear, dread sovereign, we have bin [4]
     Too tedious; neither can't be less than sin
     To wrong your princely patience:  if we have,
     Thus low dejected, we your pardon crave;
     And, if aught here offend your ear or sight,
     We only act and speak what others write.




THE PROLOGUE TO THE STAGE, AT THE COCK-PIT.

     We know not how our play may pass this stage,
     But by the best of poets [5] in that age
     THE MALTA-JEW had being and was made;
     And he then by the best of actors [6] play'd:
     In HERO AND LEANDER [7] one did gain
     A lasting memory; in Tamburlaine,
     This Jew, with others many, th' other wan
     The attribute of peerless, being a man
     Whom we may rank with (doing no one wrong)
     Proteus for shapes, and Roscius for a tongue,--
     So could he speak, so vary; nor is't hate
     To merit in him [8] who doth personate
     Our Jew this day; nor is it his ambition
     To exceed or equal, being of condition
     More modest:  this is all that he intends,
     (And that too at the urgence of some friends,)
     To prove his best, and, if none here gainsay it,
     The part he hath studied, and intends to play it.




EPILOGUE TO THE STAGE, AT THE COCK-PIT.

     In graving with Pygmalion to contend,
     Or painting with Apelles, doubtless the end
     Must be disgrace:  our actor did not so,--
     He only aim'd to go, but not out-go.
     Nor think that this day any prize was play'd; [9]
     Here were no bets at all, no wagers laid: [10]
     All the ambition that his mind doth swell,
     Is but to hear from you (by me) 'twas well.

          Scene, Malta.





THE JEW OF MALTA.

          Enter MACHIAVEL.

     MACHIAVEL. Albeit the world think Machiavel is dead,
     Yet was his soul but flown beyond the Alps;
     And, now the Guise [11] is dead, is come from France,
     To view this land, and frolic with his friends.
     To some perhaps my name is odious;
     But such as love me, guard me from their tongues,
     And let them know that I am Machiavel,
     And weigh not men, and therefore not men's words.
     Admir'd I am of those that hate me most:
     Though some speak openly against my books,
     Yet will they read me, and thereby attain
     To Peter's chair; and, when they cast me off,
     Are poison'd by my climbing followers.
     I count religion but a childish toy,
     And hold there is no sin but ignorance.
     Birds of the air will tell of murders past!
     I am asham'd to hear such fooleries.
     Many will talk of title to a crown:
     What right had Caesar to the empery? [12]
     Might first made kings, and laws were then most sure
     When, like the Draco's, [13] they were writ in blood.
     Hence comes it that a strong-built citadel
     Commands much more than letters can import:
     Which maxim had [14] Phalaris observ'd,
     H'ad never bellow'd, in a brazen bull,
     Of great ones' envy:  o' the poor petty wights
     Let me be envied and not pitied.
     But whither am I bound?  I come not, I,
     To read a lecture here [15] in Britain,
     But to present the tragedy of a Jew,
     Who smiles to see how full his bags are cramm'd;
     Which money was not got without my means.
     I crave but this,--grace him as he deserves,
     And let him not be entertain'd the worse
     Because he favours me.
          [Exit.]




ACT I. [16]

          BARABAS discovered in his counting-house, with heaps
          of gold before him.

     BARABAS. So that of thus much that return was made;
     And of the third part of the Persian ships
     There was the venture summ'd and satisfied.
     As for those Samnites, [17] and the men of Uz,
     That bought my Spanish oils and wines of Greece,
     Here have I purs'd their paltry silverlings. [18]
     Fie, what a trouble 'tis to count this trash!
     Well fare the Arabians, who so richly pay
     The things they traffic for with wedge of gold,
     Whereof a man may easily in a day
     Tell [19] that which may maintain him all his life.
     The needy groom, that never finger'd groat,
     Would make a miracle of thus much coin;
     But he whose steel-barr'd coffers are cramm'd full,
     And all his life-time hath been tired,
     Wearying his fingers' ends with telling it,
     Would in his age be loath to labour so,
     And for a pound to sweat himself to death.
     Give me the merchants of the Indian mines,
     That trade in metal of the purest mould;
     The wealthy Moor, that in the eastern rocks
     Without control can pick his riches up,
     And in his house heap pearl like pebble-stones,
     Receive them free, and sell them by the weight;
     Bags of fiery opals, sapphires, amethysts,
     Jacinths, hard topaz, grass-green emeralds,
     Beauteous rubies, sparkling diamonds,
     And seld-seen [20] costly stones of so great price,
     As one of them, indifferently rated,
     And of a carat of this quantity,
     May serve, in peril of calamity,
     To ransom great kings from captivity.
     This is the ware wherein consists my wealth;
     And thus methinks should men of judgment frame
     Their means of traffic from the vulgar trade,
     And, as their wealth increaseth, so inclose
     Infinite riches in a little room.
     But now how stands the wind?
     Into what corner peers my halcyon's bill? [21]
     Ha! to the east? yes.  See how stand the vanes--
     East and by south:  why, then, I hope my ships
     I sent for Egypt and the bordering isles
     Are gotten up by Nilus' winding banks;
     Mine argosy from Alexandria,
     Loaden with spice and silks, now under sail,
     Are smoothly gliding down by Candy-shore
     To Malta, through our Mediterranean sea.--
     But who comes here?

          Enter a MERCHANT.

                         How now!

     MERCHANT. Barabas, thy ships are safe,
     Riding in Malta-road; and all the merchants
     With other merchandise are safe arriv'd,
     And have sent me to know whether yourself
     Will come and custom them. [22]

     BARABAS. The ships are safe thou say'st, and richly fraught?

     MERCHANT. They are.

     BARABAS. Why, then, go bid them come ashore,
     And bring with them their bills of entry:
     I hope our credit in the custom-house
     Will serve as well as I were present there.
     Go send 'em threescore camels, thirty mules,
     And twenty waggons, to bring up the ware.
     But art thou master in a ship of mine,
     And is thy credit not enough for that?

     MERCHANT. The very custom barely comes to more
     Than many merchants of the town are worth,
     And therefore far exceeds my credit, sir.

     BARABAS. Go tell 'em the Jew of Malta sent thee, man:
     Tush, who amongst 'em knows not Barabas?

     MERCHANT. I go.

     BARABAS. So, then, there's somewhat come.--
     Sirrah, which of my ships art thou master of?

     MERCHANT. Of the Speranza, sir.

     BARABAS. And saw'st thou not
     Mine argosy at Alexandria?
     Thou couldst not come from Egypt, or by Caire,
     But at the entry there into the sea,
     Where Nilus pays his tribute to the main,
     Thou needs must sail by Alexandria.

     MERCHANT. I neither saw them, nor inquir'd of them:
     But this we heard some of our seamen say,
     They wonder'd how you durst with so much wealth
     Trust such a crazed vessel, and so far.

     BARABAS. Tush, they are wise!  I know her and her strength.
     But [23] go, go thou thy ways, discharge thy ship,
     And bid my factor bring his loading in.
          [Exit MERCHANT.]
     And yet I wonder at this argosy.

          Enter a Second MERCHANT.

     SECOND MERCHANT. Thine argosy from Alexandria,
     Know, Barabas, doth ride in Malta-road,
     Laden with riches, and exceeding store
     Of Persian silks, of gold, and orient pearl.

     BARABAS. How chance you came not with those other ships
     That sail'd by Egypt?

     SECOND MERCHANT. Sir, we saw 'em not.

     BARABAS. Belike they coasted round by Candy-shore
     About their oils or other businesses.
     But 'twas ill done of you to come so far
     Without the aid or conduct of their ships.

     SECOND MERCHANT. Sir, we were wafted by a Spanish fleet,
     That never left us till within a league,
     That had the galleys of the Turk in chase.

     BARABAS. O, they were going up to Sicily.
     Well, go,
     And bid the merchants and my men despatch,
     And come ashore, and see the fraught [24] discharg'd.

     SECOND MERCHANT. I go.
          [Exit.]

     BARABAS. Thus trolls our fortune in by land and sea,
     And thus are we on every side enrich'd:
     These are the blessings promis'd to the Jews,
     And herein was old Abraham's happiness:
     What more may heaven do for earthly man
     Than thus to pour out plenty in their laps,
     Ripping the bowels of the earth for them,
     Making the sea[s] their servants, and the winds
     To drive their substance with successful blasts?
     Who hateth me but for my happiness?
     Or who is honour'd now but for his wealth?
     Rather had I, a Jew, be hated thus,
     Than pitied in a Christian poverty;
     For I can see no fruits in all their faith,
     But malice, falsehood, and excessive pride,
     Which methinks fits not their profession.
     Haply some hapless man hath conscience,
     And for his conscience lives in beggary.
     They say we are a scatter'd nation:
     I cannot tell; but we have scambled [25] up
     More wealth by far than those that brag of faith:
     There's Kirriah Jairim, the great Jew of Greece,
     Obed in Bairseth, Nones in Portugal,
     Myself in Malta, some in Italy,
     Many in France, and wealthy every one;
     Ay, wealthier far than any Christian.
     I must confess we come not to be kings:
     That's not our fault:  alas, our number's few!
     And crowns come either by succession,
     Or urg'd by force; and nothing violent,
     Oft have I heard tell, can be permanent.
     Give us a peaceful rule; make Christians kings,
     That thirst so much for principality.
     I have no charge, nor many children,
     But one sole daughter, whom I hold as dear
     As Agamemnon did his Iphigen;
     And all I have is hers.--But who comes here?

          Enter three JEWS. [26]

     FIRST JEW. Tush, tell not me; 'twas done of policy.

     SECOND JEW. Come, therefore, let us go to Barabas;
     For he can counsel best in these affairs:
     And here he comes.

     BARABAS. Why, how now, countrymen!
     Why flock you thus to me in multitudes?
     What accident's betided to the Jews?

     FIRST JEW. A fleet of warlike galleys, Barabas,
     Are come from Turkey, and lie in our road:
     And they this day sit in the council-house
     To entertain them and their embassy.

     BARABAS. Why, let 'em come, so they come not to war;
     Or let 'em war, so we be conquerors.--
     Nay, let 'em combat, conquer, and kill all,
     So they spare me, my daughter, and my wealth.
          [Aside.]

     FIRST JEW. Were it for confirmation of a league,
     They would not come in warlike manner thus.

     SECOND JEW. I fear their coming will afflict us all.

     BARABAS. Fond [27] men, what dream you of their multitudes?
     What need they treat of peace that are in league?
     The Turks and those of Malta are in league:
     Tut, tut, there is some other matter in't.

     FIRST JEW. Why, Barabas, they come for peace or war.

     BARABAS. Haply for neither, but to pass along,
     Towards Venice, by the Adriatic sea,
     With whom they have attempted many times,
     But never could effect their stratagem.

     THIRD JEW. And very wisely said; it may be so.

     SECOND JEW. But there's a meeting in the senate-house,
     And all the Jews in Malta must be there.

     BARABAS. Hum,--all the Jews in Malta must be there!
     Ay, like enough:  why, then, let every man
     Provide him, and be there for fashion-sake.
     If any thing shall there concern our state,
     Assure yourselves I'll look--unto myself.
          [Aside.] [28]

     FIRST JEW. I know you will.--Well, brethren, let us go.

     SECOND JEW. Let's take our leaves.--Farewell, good Barabas.

     BARABAS. [29] Farewell, Zaareth; farewell, Temainte.
          [Exeunt JEWS.]
     And, Barabas, now search this secret out;
     Summon thy senses, call thy wits together:
     These silly men mistake the matter clean.
     Long to the Turk did Malta contribute;
     Which tribute all in policy, I fear,
     The Turk has [30] let increase to such a sum
     As all the wealth of Malta cannot pay;
     And now by that advantage thinks, belike,
     To seize upon the town; ay, that he seeks.
     Howe'er the world go, I'll make sure for one,
     And seek in time to intercept the worst,
     Warily guarding that which I ha' got:
     Ego mihimet sum semper proximus: [31]
     Why, let 'em enter, let 'em take the town.
          [Exit.] [32]

          Enter FERNEZE governor of Malta, KNIGHTS, and OFFICERS;
          met by CALYMATH, and BASSOES of the TURK.

     FERNEZE. Now, bassoes, [33] what demand you at our hands?

     FIRST BASSO. Know, knights of Malta, that we came from Rhodes,
     ]From Cyprus, Candy, and those other isles
     That lie betwixt the Mediterranean seas.

     FERNEZE. What's Cyprus, Candy, and those other isles
     To us or Malta? what at our hands demand ye?

     CALYMATH. The ten years' tribute that remains unpaid.

     FERNEZE. Alas, my lord, the sum is over-great!
     I hope your highness will consider us.

     CALYMATH. I wish, grave governor, [34] 'twere in my power
     To favour you; but 'tis my father's cause,
     Wherein I may not, nay, I dare not dally.

     FERNEZE. Then give us leave, great Selim Calymath.

     CALYMATH. Stand all aside, [35] and let the knights determine;
     And send to keep our galleys under sail,
     For happily [36] we shall not tarry here.--
     Now, governor, how are you resolv'd?

     FERNEZE. Thus; since your hard conditions are such
     That you will needs have ten years' tribute past,
     We may have time to make collection
     Amongst the inhabitants of Malta for't.

     FIRST BASSO. That's more than is in our commission.

     CALYMATH. What, Callapine! a little courtesy:
     Let's know their time; perhaps it is not long;
     And 'tis more kingly to obtain by peace
     Than to enforce conditions by constraint.--
     What respite ask you, governor?

     FERNEZE. But a month.

     CALYMATH. We grant a month; but see you keep your promise.
     Now launch our galleys back again to sea,
     Where we'll attend the respite you have ta'en,
     And for the money send our messenger.
     Farewell, great governor, and brave knights of Malta.

     FERNEZE. And all good fortune wait on Calymath!
          [Exeunt CALYMATH and BASSOES.]
     Go one and call those Jews of Malta hither:
     Were they not summon'd to appear to-day?

     FIRST OFFICER. They were, my lord; and here they come.

          Enter BARABAS and three JEWS.

     FIRST KNIGHT. Have you determin'd what to say to them?

     FERNEZE. Yes; give me leave:--and, Hebrews, now come near.
     ]From the Emperor of Turkey is arriv'd
     Great Selim Calymath, his highness' son,
     To levy of us ten years' tribute past:
     Now, then, here know that it concerneth us.

     BARABAS. Then, good my lord, to keep your quiet still,
     Your lordship shall do well to let them have it.

     FERNEZE. Soft, Barabas! there's more 'longs to't than so.
     To what this ten years' tribute will amount,
     That we have cast, but cannot compass it
     By reason of the wars, that robb'd our store;
     And therefore are we to request your aid.

     BARABAS. Alas, my lord, we are no soldiers!
     And what's our aid against so great a prince?

     FIRST KNIGHT. Tut, Jew, we know thou art no soldier:
     Thou art a merchant and a money'd man,
     And 'tis thy money, Barabas, we seek.

     BARABAS. How, my lord! my money!

     FERNEZE. Thine and the rest;
     For, to be short, amongst you't must be had.

     FIRST JEW. Alas, my lord, the most of us are poor!

     FERNEZE. Then let the rich increase your portions.

     BARABAS. Are strangers with your tribute to be tax'd?

     SECOND KNIGHT. Have strangers leave with us to get their wealth?
     Then let them with us contribute.

     BARABAS. How! equally?

     FERNEZE. No, Jew, like infidels;
     For through our sufferance of your hateful lives,
     Who stand accursed in the sight of heaven,
     These taxes and afflictions are befall'n,
     And therefore thus we are determined.--
     Read there the articles of our decrees.

     OFFICER. [37] [reads] FIRST, THE TRIBUTE-MONEY OF THE TURKS
     SHALL ALL BE LEVIED AMONGST THE JEWS, AND EACH OF THEM TO PAY
     ONE HALF OF HIS ESTATE.

     BARABAS. How! half his estate!--I hope you mean not mine.
          [Aside.]

     FERNEZE. Read on.

     OFFICER. [reads] SECONDLY, HE THAT DENIES [38] TO PAY, SHALL
     STRAIGHT-BECOME A CHRISTIAN.

     BARABAS. How! a Christian!--Hum,--what's here to do?
          [Aside.]

     OFFICER. [reads] LASTLY, HE THAT DENIES THIS, SHALL ABSOLUTELY
     LOSE ALL HE HAS.

     THREE JEWS. O my lord, we will give half!

     BARABAS. O earth-mettled villains, and no Hebrews born!
     And will you basely thus submit yourselves
     To leave your goods to their arbitrement?

     FERNEZE. Why, Barabas, wilt thou be christened?

     BARABAS. No, governor, I will be no convertite. [39]

     FERNEZE. Then pay thy half.

     BARABAS. Why, know you what you did by this device?
     Half of my substance is a city's wealth.
     Governor, it was not got so easily;
     Nor will I part so slightly therewithal.

     FERNEZE. Sir, half is the penalty of our decree;
     Either pay that, or we will seize on all.

     BARABAS. Corpo di Dio! stay:  you shall have half;
     Let me be us'd but as my brethren are.

     FERNEZE. No, Jew, thou hast denied the articles,
     And now it cannot be recall'd.
          [Exeunt OFFICERS, on a sign from FERNEZE]

     BARABAS. Will you, then, steal my goods?
     Is theft the ground of your religion?

     FERNEZE. No, Jew; we take particularly thine,
     To save the ruin of a multitude:
     And better one want for a common good,
     Than many perish for a private man:
     Yet, Barabas, we will not banish thee,
     But here in Malta, where thou gott'st thy wealth,
     Live still; and, if thou canst, get more.

     BARABAS. Christians, what or how can I multiply?
     Of naught is nothing made.

     FIRST KNIGHT. From naught at first thou cam'st to little wealth,
     ]From little unto more, from more to most:
     If your first curse fall heavy on thy head,
     And make thee poor and scorn'd of all the world,
     'Tis not our fault, but thy inherent sin.

     BARABAS. What, bring you Scripture to confirm your wrongs?
     Preach me not out of my possessions.
     Some Jews are wicked, as all Christians are:
     But say the tribe that I descended of
     Were all in general cast away for sin,
     Shall I be tried by their transgression?
     The man that dealeth righteously shall live;
     And which of you can charge me otherwise?

     FERNEZE. Out, wretched Barabas!
     Sham'st thou not thus to justify thyself,
     As if we knew not thy profession?
     If thou rely upon thy righteousness,
     Be patient, and thy riches will increase.
     Excess of wealth is cause of covetousness;
     And covetousness, O, 'tis a monstrous sin!

     BARABAS. Ay, but theft is worse:  tush! take not from me, then,
     For that is theft; and, if you rob me thus,
     I must be forc'd to steal, and compass more.

     FIRST KNIGHT. Grave governor, list not to his exclaims:
     Convert his mansion to a nunnery;
     His house will harbour many holy nuns.

     FERNEZE. It shall be so.

          Re-enter OFFICERS.

                         Now, officers, have you done?

     FIRST OFFICER. Ay, my lord, we have seiz'd upon the goods
     And wares of Barabas, which, being valu'd,
     Amount to more than all the wealth in Malta:
     And of the other we have seized half.

     FERNEZE. Then we'll take [40] order for the residue.

     BARABAS. Well, then, my lord, say, are you satisfied?
     You have my goods, my money, and my wealth,
     My ships, my store, and all that I enjoy'd;
     And, having all, you can request no more,
     Unless your unrelenting flinty hearts
     Suppress all pity in your stony breasts,
     And now shall move you to bereave my life.

     FERNEZE. No, Barabas; to stain our hands with blood
     Is far from us and our profession.

     BARABAS.  Why, I esteem the injury far less,
     To take the lives of miserable men
     Than be the causers of their misery.
     You have my wealth, the labour of my life,
     The comfort of mine age, my children's hope;
     And therefore ne'er distinguish of the wrong.

     FERNEZE. Content thee, Barabas; thou hast naught but right.

     BARABAS. Your extreme right does me exceeding wrong:
     But take it to you, i'the devil's name!

     FERNEZE. Come, let us in, and gather of these goods
     The money for this tribute of the Turk.

     FIRST KNIGHT. 'Tis necessary that be look'd unto;
     For, if we break our day, we break the league,
     And that will prove but simple policy.
          [Exeunt all except BARABAS and the three JEWS.]

     BARABAS. Ay, policy! that's their profession,
     And not simplicity, as they suggest.--
     The plagues of Egypt, and the curse of heaven,
     Earth's barrenness, and all men's hatred,
     Inflict upon them, thou great Primus Motor!
     And here upon my knees, striking the earth,
     I ban their souls to everlasting pains,
     And extreme tortures of the fiery deep,
     That thus have dealt with me in my distress!

     FIRST JEW. O, yet be patient, gentle Barabas!

     BARABAS. O silly brethren, born to see this day,
     Why stand you thus unmov'd with my laments?
     Why weep you not to think upon my wrongs?
     Why pine not I, and die in this distress?

     FIRST JEW. Why, Barabas, as hardly can we brook
     The cruel handling of ourselves in this:
     Thou seest they have taken half our goods.

     BARABAS. Why did you yield to their extortion?
     You were a multitude, and I but one;
     And of me only have they taken all.

     FIRST JEW. Yet, brother Barabas, remember Job.

     BARABAS. What tell you me of Job? I wot his wealth
     Was written thus; he had seven thousand sheep,
     Three thousand camels, and two hundred yoke
     Of labouring oxen, and five hundred
     She-asses:  but for every one of those,
     Had they been valu'd at indifferent rate,
     I had at home, and in mine argosy,
     And other ships that came from Egypt last,
     As much as would have bought his beasts and him,
     And yet have kept enough to live upon;
     So that not he, but I, may curse the day,
     Thy fatal birth-day, forlorn Barabas;
     And henceforth wish for an eternal night,
     That clouds of darkness may inclose my flesh,
     And hide these extreme sorrows from mine eyes;
     For only I have toil'd to inherit here
     The months of vanity, and loss of time,
     And painful nights, have been appointed me.

     SECOND JEW. Good Barabas, be patient.

     BARABAS. Ay, I pray, leave me in my patience.  You, that
     Were ne'er possess'd of wealth, are pleas'd with want;
     But give him liberty at least to mourn,
     That in a field, amidst his enemies,
     Doth see his soldiers slain, himself disarm'd,
     And knows no means of his recovery:
     Ay, let me sorrow for this sudden chance;
     'Tis in the trouble of my spirit I speak:
     Great injuries are not so soon forgot.

     FIRST JEW. Come, let us leave him; in his ireful mood
     Our words will but increase his ecstasy. [41]

     SECOND JEW. On, then:  but, trust me, 'tis a misery
     To see a man in such affliction.--
     Farewell, Barabas.

     BARABAS. Ay, fare you well.
          [Exeunt three JEWS.] [42]
     See the simplicity of these base slaves,
     Who, for the villains have no wit themselves,
     Think me to be a senseless lump of clay,
     That will with every water wash to dirt!
     No, Barabas is born to better chance,
     And fram'd of finer mould than common men,
     That measure naught but by the present time.
     A reaching thought will search his deepest wits,
     And cast with cunning for the time to come;
     For evils are apt to happen every day.

          Enter ABIGAIL.

     But whither wends my beauteous Abigail?
     O, what has made my lovely daughter sad?
     What, woman! moan not for a little loss;
     Thy father has enough in store for thee.

     ABIGAIL. Nor for myself, but aged Barabas,
     Father, for thee lamenteth Abigail:
     But I will learn to leave these fruitless tears;
     And, urg'd thereto with my afflictions,
     With fierce exclaims run to the senate-house,
     And in the senate reprehend them all,
     And rent their hearts with tearing of my hair,
     Till they reduce [43] the wrongs done to my father.

     BARABAS. No, Abigail; things past recovery
     Are hardly cur'd with exclamations:
     Be silent, daughter; sufferance breeds ease,
     And time may yield us an occasion,
     Which on the sudden cannot serve the turn.
     Besides, my girl, think me not all so fond [44]
     As negligently to forgo so much
     Without provision for thyself and me:
     Ten thousand portagues, [45] besides great pearls,
     Rich costly jewels, and stones infinite,
     Fearing the worst of this before it fell,
     I closely hid.

     ABIGAIL. Where, father?

     BARABAS. In my house, my girl.

     ABIGAIL. Then shall they ne'er be seen of Barabas;
     For they have seiz'd upon thy house and wares.

     BARABAS. But they will give me leave once more, I trow,
     To go into my house.

     ABIGAIL. That may they not;
     For there I left the governor placing nuns,
     Displacing me; and of thy house they mean
     To make a nunnery, where none but their own sect [46]
     Must enter in; men generally barr'd.

     BARABAS. My gold, my gold, and all my wealth is gone!--
     You partial heavens, have I deserv'd this plague?
     What, will you thus oppose me, luckless stars,
     To make me desperate in my poverty?
     And, knowing me impatient in distress,
     Think me so mad as I will hang myself,
     That I may vanish o'er the earth in air,
     And leave no memory that e'er I was?
     No, I will live; nor loathe I this my life:
     And, since you leave me in the ocean thus
     To sink or swim, and put me to my shifts,
     I'll rouse my senses, and awake myself.--
     Daughter, I have it:  thou perceiv'st the plight
     Wherein these Christians have oppressed me:
     Be rul'd by me, for in extremity
     We ought to make bar of no policy.

     ABIGAIL. Father, whate'er it be, to injure them
     That have so manifestly wronged us,
     What will not Abigail attempt?

     BARABAS. Why, so.
     Then thus:  thou told'st me they have turn'd my house
     Into a nunnery, and some nuns are there?

     ABIGAIL. I did.

     BARABAS. Then, Abigail, there must my girl
     Entreat the abbess to be entertain'd.

     ABIGAIL. How! as a nun?

     BARABAS. Ay, daughter; for religion
     Hides many mischiefs from suspicion.

     ABIGAIL. Ay, but, father, they will suspect me there.

     BARABAS. Let 'em suspect; but be thou so precise
     As they may think it done of holiness:
     Entreat 'em fair, and give them friendly speech,
     And seem to them as if thy sins were great,
     Till thou hast gotten to be entertain'd.

     ABIGAIL. Thus, father, shall I much dissemble.

     BARABAS. Tush!
     As good dissemble that thou never mean'st,
     As first mean truth and then dissemble it:
     A counterfeit profession is better
     Than unseen hypocrisy.

     ABIGAIL. Well, father, say I be entertain'd,
     What then shall follow?

     BARABAS. This shall follow then.
     There have I hid, close underneath the plank
     That runs along the upper-chamber floor,
     The gold and jewels which I kept for thee:--
     But here they come:  be cunning, Abigail.

     ABIGAIL. Then, father, go with me.

     BARABAS. No, Abigail, in this
     It is not necessary I be seen;
     For I will seem offended with thee for't:
     Be close, my girl, for this must fetch my gold.
          [They retire.]

          Enter FRIAR JACOMO, [47] FRIAR BARNARDINE, ABBESS, and a NUN.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Sisters,
     We now are almost at the new-made nunnery.

     ABBESS. [48] The better; for we love not to be seen:
     'Tis thirty winters long since some of us
     Did stray so far amongst the multitude.

     FRIAR JACOMO. But, madam, this house
     And waters of this new-made nunnery
     Will much delight you.

     ABBESS. It may be so.--But who comes here?

          [ABIGAIL comes forward.]

     ABIGAIL. Grave abbess, and you happy virgins' guide,
     Pity the state of a distressed maid!

     ABBESS. What art thou, daughter?

     ABIGAIL. The hopeless daughter of a hapless Jew,
     The Jew of Malta, wretched Barabas,
     Sometimes [49] the owner of a goodly house,
     Which they have now turn'd to a nunnery.

     ABBESS. Well, daughter, say, what is thy suit with us?

     ABIGAIL. Fearing the afflictions which my father feels
     Proceed from sin or want of faith in us,
     I'd pass away my life in penitence,
     And be a novice in your nunnery,
     To make atonement for my labouring soul.

     FRIAR JACOMO. No doubt, brother, but this proceedeth of
     the spirit.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE.
     Ay, and of a moving spirit too, brother:  but come,
     Let us entreat she may be entertain'd.

     ABBESS. Well, daughter, we admit you for a nun.

     ABIGAIL. First let me as a novice learn to frame
     My solitary life to your strait laws,
     And let me lodge where I was wont to lie:
     I do not doubt, by your divine precepts
     And mine own industry, but to profit much.

     BARABAS. As much, I hope, as all I hid is worth.
          [Aside.]

     ABBESS. Come, daughter, follow us.

     BARABAS. [coming forward] Why, how now, Abigail!
     What mak'st thou 'mongst these hateful Christians?

     FRIAR JACOMO. Hinder her not, thou man of little faith,
     For she has mortified herself.

     BARABAS. How! mortified!

     FRIAR JACOMO. And is admitted to the sisterhood.

     BARABAS. Child of perdition, and thy father's shame!
     What wilt thou do among these hateful fiends?
     I charge thee on my blessing that thou leave
     These devils and their damned heresy!

     ABIGAIL. Father, forgive me-- [50]

     BARABAS. Nay, back, Abigail,
     And think upon the jewels and the gold;
     The board is marked thus that covers it.--
          [Aside to ABIGAIL in a whisper.]
     Away, accursed, from thy father's sight!

     FRIAR JACOMO. Barabas, although thou art in misbelief,
     And wilt not see thine own afflictions,
     Yet let thy daughter be no longer blind.

     BARABAS. Blind friar, I reck not thy persuasions,--
     The board is marked thus [51] that covers it--
          [Aside to ABIGAIL in a whisper.]
     For I had rather die than see her thus.--
     Wilt thou forsake me too in my distress,
     Seduced daughter?--Go, forget not.-- [52]
          [Aside to her in a whisper.]
     Becomes it Jews to be so credulous?--
     To-morrow early I'll be at the door.--
          [Aside to her in a whisper.]
     No, come not at me; if thou wilt be damn'd,
     Forget me, see me not; and so, be gone!--
     Farewell; remember to-morrow morning.--
          [Aside to her in a whisper.]
     Out, out, thou wretch!
          [Exit, on one side, BARABAS.  Exeunt, on the other side,
          FRIARS, ABBESS, NUN, and ABIGAIL:  and, as they are going
          out,]

          Enter MATHIAS.

     MATHIAS. Who's this? fair Abigail, the rich Jew's daughter,
     Become a nun! her father's sudden fall
     Has humbled her, and brought her down to this:
     Tut, she were fitter for a tale of love,
     Than to be tired out with orisons;
     And better would she far become a bed,
     Embraced in a friendly lover's arms,
     Than rise at midnight to a solemn mass.

          Enter LODOWICK.

     LODOWICK. Why, how now, Don Mathias! in a dump?

     MATHIAS. Believe me, noble Lodowick, I have seen
     The strangest sight, in my opinion,
     That ever I beheld.

     LODOWICK. What was't, I prithee?

     MATHIAS. A fair young maid, scarce fourteen years of age,
     The sweetest flower in Cytherea's field,
     Cropt from the pleasures of the fruitful earth,
     And strangely metamorphos'd [to a] nun.

     LODOWICK. But say, what was she?

     MATHIAS. Why, the rich Jew's daughter.

     LODOWICK. What, Barabas, whose goods were lately seiz'd?
     Is she so fair?

     MATHIAS. And matchless beautiful,
     As, had you seen her, 'twould have mov'd your heart,
     Though countermin'd with walls of brass, to love,
     Or, at the least, to pity.

     LODOWICK. An if she be so fair as you report,
     'Twere time well spent to go and visit her:
     How say you? shall we?

     MATHIAS. I must and will, sir; there's no remedy.

     LODOWICK. And so will I too, or it shall go hard.
     Farewell, Mathias.

     MATHIAS. Farewell, Lodowick.
          [Exeunt severally.]




ACT II.

          Enter BARABAS, with a light. [53]

     BARABAS. Thus, like the sad-presaging raven, that tolls
     The sick man's passport in her hollow beak, [54]
     And in the shadow of the silent night
     Doth shake contagion from her sable wings,
     Vex'd and tormented runs poor Barabas
     With fatal curses towards these Christians.
     The incertain pleasures of swift-footed time
     Have ta'en their flight, and left me in despair;
     And of my former riches rests no more
     But bare remembrance; like a soldier's scar,
     That has no further comfort for his maim.--
     O Thou, that with a fiery pillar ledd'st
     The sons of Israel through the dismal shades,
     Light Abraham's offspring; and direct the hand
     Of Abigail this night! or let the day
     Turn to eternal darkness after this!--
     No sleep can fasten on my watchful eyes,
     Nor quiet enter my distemper'd thoughts,
     Till I have answer of my Abigail.

          Enter ABIGAIL above.

     ABIGAIL. Now have I happily espied a time
     To search the plank my father did appoint;
     And here, behold, unseen, where I have found
     The gold, the pearls, and jewels, which he hid.

     BARABAS. Now I remember those old women's words,
     Who in my wealth would tell me winter's tales,
     And speak of spirits and ghosts that glide by night
     About the place where treasure hath been hid:
     And now methinks that I am one of those;
     For, whilst I live, here lives my soul's sole hope,
     And, when I die, here shall my spirit walk.

     ABIGAIL. Now that my father's fortune were so good
     As but to be about this happy place!
     'Tis not so happy:  yet, when we parted last,
     He said he would attend me in the morn.
     Then, gentle Sleep, where'er his body rests,
     Give charge to Morpheus that he may dream
     A golden dream, and of [55] the sudden wake, [56]
     Come and receive the treasure I have found.

     BARABAS. Bueno para todos mi ganado no era: [57]
     As good go on, as sit so sadly thus.--
     But stay:  what star shines yonder in the east? [58]
     The loadstar of my life, if Abigail.--
     Who's there?

     ABIGAIL. Who's that?

     BARABAS. Peace, Abigail! 'tis I.

     ABIGAIL. Then, father, here receive thy happiness.

     BARABAS. Hast thou't?

     ABIGAIL. Here.[throws down bags]  Hast thou't?
     There's more, and more, and more.

     BARABAS. O my girl,
     My gold, my fortune, my felicity,
     Strength to my soul, death to mine enemy;
     Welcome the first beginner of my bliss!
     O Abigail, Abigail, that I had thee here too!
     Then my desires were fully satisfied:
     But I will practice thy enlargement thence:
     O girl! O gold! O beauty! O my bliss!
          [Hugs the bags.]

     ABIGAIL. Father, it draweth towards midnight now,
     And 'bout this time the nuns begin to wake;
     To shun suspicion, therefore, let us part.

     BARABAS. Farewell, my joy, and by my fingers take
     A kiss from him that sends it from his soul.
          [Exit ABIGAIL above.]
     Now, Phoebus, ope the eye-lids of the day.
     And, for the raven, wake the morning lark,
     That I may hover with her in the air,
     Singing o'er these, as she does o'er her young.
     Hermoso placer de los dineros. [59]
          [Exit.]

          Enter FERNEZE, [60] MARTIN DEL BOSCO, KNIGHTS, and OFFICERS.

     FERNEZE. Now, captain, tell us whither thou art bound?
     Whence is thy ship that anchors in our road?
     And why thou cam'st ashore without our leave?

     MARTIN DEL BOSCO. Governor of Malta, hither am I bound;
     My ship, the Flying Dragon, is of Spain,
     And so am I; Del Bosco is my name,
     Vice-admiral unto the Catholic King.

     FIRST KNIGHT. 'Tis true, my lord; therefore entreat [61] him well.

     MARTIN DEL BOSCO.
     Our fraught is Grecians, Turks, and Afric Moors;
     For late upon the coast of Corsica,
     Because we vail'd not [62] to the Turkish [63] fleet,
     Their creeping galleys had us in the chase:
     But suddenly the wind began to rise,
     And then we luff'd and tack'd, [64] and fought at ease:
     Some have we fir'd, and many have we sunk;
     But one amongst the rest became our prize:
     The captain's slain; the rest remain our slaves,
     Of whom we would make sale in Malta here.

     FERNEZE. Martin del Bosco, I have heard of thee:
     Welcome to Malta, and to all of us!
     But to admit a sale of these thy Turks,
     We may not, nay, we dare not give consent,
     By reason of a tributary league.

     FIRST KNIGHT. Del Bosco, as thou lov'st and honour'st us,
     Persuade our governor against the Turk:
     This truce we have is but in hope of gold,
     And with that sum he craves might we wage war.

     MARTIN DEL BOSCO. Will knights of Malta be in league with Turks,
     And buy it basely too for sums of gold?
     My lord, remember that, to Europe's shame,
     The Christian isle of Rhodes, from whence you came,
     Was lately lost, and you were stated [65] here
     To be at deadly enmity with Turks.

     FERNEZE. Captain, we know it; but our force is small.

     MARTIN DEL BOSCO. What is the sum that Calymath requires?

     FERNEZE. A hundred thousand crowns.

     MARTIN DEL BOSCO. My lord and king hath title to this isle,
     And he means quickly to expel you hence;
     Therefore be rul'd by me, and keep the gold:
     I'll write unto his majesty for aid,
     And not depart until I see you free.

     FERNEZE. On this condition shall thy Turks be sold.--
     Go, officers, and set them straight in show.--
          [Exeunt OFFICERS.]
     Bosco, thou shalt be Malta's general;
     We and our warlike knights will follow thee
     Against these barbarous misbelieving Turks.

     MARTIN DEL BOSCO. So shall you imitate those you succeed;
     For, when their hideous force environ'd Rhodes,
     Small though the number was that kept the town,
     They fought it out, and not a man surviv'd
     To bring the hapless news to Christendom.

     FERNEZE. So will we fight it out:  come, let's away.
     Proud daring Calymath, instead of gold,
     We'll send thee bullets wrapt in smoke and fire:
     Claim tribute where thou wilt, we are resolv'd,--
     Honour is bought with blood, and not with gold.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter OFFICERS, [66] with ITHAMORE and other SLAVES.

     FIRST OFFICER. This is the market-place; here let 'em stand:
     Fear not their sale, for they'll be quickly bought.

     SECOND OFFICER. Every one's price is written on his back,
     And so much must they yield, or not be sold.

     FIRST OFFICER.
     Here comes the Jew:  had not his goods been seiz'd,
     He'd give us present money for them all.

          Enter BARABAS.

     BARABAS. In spite of these swine-eating Christians,
     (Unchosen nation, never circumcis'd,
     Poor villains, such as were [67] ne'er thought upon
     Till Titus and Vespasian conquer'd us,)
     Am I become as wealthy as I was.
     They hop'd my daughter would ha' been a nun;
     But she's at home, and I have bought a house
     As great and fair as is the governor's:
     And there, in spite of Malta, will I dwell,
     Having Ferneze's hand; whose heart I'll have,
     Ay, and his son's too, or it shall go hard.
     I am not of the tribe of Levi, I,
     That can so soon forget an injury.
     We Jews can fawn like spaniels when we please;
     And when we grin we bite; yet are our looks
     As innocent and harmless as a lamb's.
     I learn'd in Florence how to kiss my hand,
     Heave up my shoulders when they call me dog,
     And duck as low as any bare-foot friar;
     Hoping to see them starve upon a stall,
     Or else be gather'd for in our synagogue,
     That, when the offering-basin comes to me,
     Even for charity I may spit into't.--
     Here comes Don Lodowick, the governor's son,
     One that I love for his good father's sake.

          Enter LODOWICK.

     LODOWICK. I hear the wealthy Jew walked this way:
     I'll seek him out, and so insinuate,
     That I may have a sight of Abigail,
     For Don Mathias tells me she is fair.

     BARABAS. Now will I shew myself to have more of the serpent than
     the dove; that is, more knave than fool.
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. Yond' walks the Jew:  now for fair Abigail.

     BARABAS. Ay, ay, no doubt but she's at your command.
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. Barabas, thou know'st I am the governor's son.

     BARABAS.
     I would you were his father too, sir! that's all the harm
     I wish you.--The slave looks like a hog's cheek new-singed.
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. Whither walk'st thou, Barabas?

     BARABAS. No further:  'tis a custom held with us,
     That when we speak with Gentiles like to you,
     We turn into [68] the air to purge ourselves;
     For unto us the promise doth belong.

     LODOWICK. Well, Barabas, canst help me to a diamond?

     BARABAS. O, sir, your father had my diamonds:
     Yet I have one left that will serve your turn.--
     I mean my daughter; but, ere he shall have her,
     I'll sacrifice her on a pile of wood:
     I ha' the poison of the city [69] for him,
     And the white leprosy.
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. What sparkle does it give without a foil?

     BARABAS. The diamond that I talk of ne'er was foil'd:--
     But, when he touches it, it will be foil'd.-- [70]
          [Aside.]
     Lord Lodowick, it sparkles bright and fair.

     LODOWICK. Is it square or pointed? pray, let me know.

     BARABAS. Pointed it is, good sir,--but not for you.
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. I like it much the better.

     BARABAS. So do I too.

     LODOWICK. How shews it by night?

     BARABAS. Outshines Cynthia's rays:--
     You'll like it better far o' nights than days.
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. And what's the price?

     BARABAS. Your life, an if you have it [Aside].--O my lord,
     We will not jar about the price:  come to my house,
     And I will give't your honour--with a vengeance.
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. No, Barabas, I will deserve it first.

     BARABAS. Good sir,
     Your father has deserv'd it at my hands,
     Who, of mere charity and Christian ruth,
     To bring me to religious purity,
     And, as it were, in catechising sort,
     To make me mindful of my mortal sins,
     Against my will, and whether I would or no,
     Seiz'd all I had, and thrust me out o' doors,
     And made my house a place for nuns most chaste.

     LODOWICK. No doubt your soul shall reap the fruit of it.

     BARABAS. Ay, but, my lord, the harvest is far off:
     And yet I know the prayers of those nuns
     And holy friars, having money for their pains,
     Are wondrous;--and indeed do no man good;--
          [Aside.]
     And, seeing they are not idle, but still doing,
     'Tis likely they in time may reap some fruit,
     I mean, in fullness of perfection.

     LODOWICK. Good Barabas, glance not at our holy nuns.

     BARABAS. No, but I do it through a burning zeal,--
     Hoping ere long to set the house a-fire;
     For, though they do a while increase and multiply,
     I'll have a saying to that nunnery.-- [71]
          [Aside.]
     As for the diamond, sir, I told you of,
     Come home, and there's no price shall make us part,
     Even for your honourable father's sake,--
     It shall go hard but I will see your death.--
          [Aside.]
     But now I must be gone to buy a slave.

     LODOWICK. And, Barabas, I'll bear thee company.

     BARABAS. Come, then; here's the market-place.--
     What's the price of this slave? two hundred crowns! do the Turks
     weigh so much?

     FIRST OFFICER. Sir, that's his price.

     BARABAS. What, can he steal, that you demand so much?
     Belike he has some new trick for a purse;
     An if he has, he is worth three hundred plates, [72]
     So that, being bought, the town-seal might be got
     To keep him for his life-time from the gallows:
     The sessions-day is critical to thieves,
     And few or none scape but by being purg'd.

     LODOWICK. Rat'st thou this Moor but at two hundred plates?

     FIRST OFFICER. No more, my lord.

     BARABAS. Why should this Turk be dearer than that Moor?

     FIRST OFFICER. Because he is young, and has more qualities.

     BARABAS. What, hast the philosopher's stone? an thou hast, break
     my head with it, I'll forgive thee.

     SLAVE. [73] No, sir; I can cut and shave.

     BARABAS. Let me see, sirrah; are you not an old shaver?

     SLAVE. Alas, sir, I am a very youth!

     BARABAS. A youth! I'll buy you, and marry you to Lady Vanity, [74]
     if you do well.

     SLAVE. I will serve you, sir.

     BARABAS. Some wicked trick or other:  it may be, under colour
     of shaving, thou'lt cut my throat for my goods.  Tell me,
     hast thou thy health well?

     SLAVE. Ay, passing well.

     BARABAS. So much the worse:  I must have one that's sickly, an't
     be but for sparing victuals:  'tis not a stone of beef a-day
     will maintain you in these chops.--Let me see one that's
     somewhat leaner.

     FIRST OFFICER. Here's a leaner; how like you him?

     BARABAS. Where wast thou born?

     ITHAMORE. In Thrace; brought up in Arabia.

     BARABAS. So much the better; thou art for my turn.
     An hundred crowns?  I'll have him; there's the coin.
          [Gives money.]

     FIRST OFFICER. Then mark him, sir, and take him hence.

     BARABAS. Ay, mark him, you were best; for this is he
     That by my help shall do much villany.--
          [Aside.]
     My lord, farewell.--Come, sirrah; you are mine.--
     As for the diamond, it shall be yours:
     I pray, sir, be no stranger at my house;
     All that I have shall be at your command.

          Enter MATHIAS and KATHARINE. [75]

     MATHIAS. What make the Jew and Lodowick so private?
     I fear me 'tis about fair Abigail.
          [Aside.]

     BARABAS. [to LODOWICK.] Yonder comes Don Mathias; let us stay: [76]
     He loves my daughter, and she holds him dear;
     But I have sworn to frustrate both their hopes,
     And be reveng'd upon the--governor.
          [Aside.]
          [Exit LODOWICK.]

     KATHARINE. This Moor is comeliest, is he not? speak, son.

     MATHIAS. No, this is the better, mother, view this well.

     BARABAS. Seem not to know me here before your mother,
     Lest she mistrust the match that is in hand:
     When you have brought her home, come to my house;
     Think of me as thy father:  son, farewell.

     MATHIAS. But wherefore talk'd Don Lodowick with you?

     BARABAS. Tush, man! we talk'd of diamonds, not of Abigail.

     KATHARINE. Tell me, Mathias, is not that the Jew?

     BARABAS. As for the comment on the Maccabees,
     I have it, sir, and 'tis at your command.

     MATHIAS. Yes, madam, and my talk with him was [77]
     About the borrowing of a book or two.

     KATHARINE. Converse not with him; he is cast off from heaven.--
     Thou hast thy crowns, fellow.--Come, let's away.

     MATHIAS. Sirrah Jew, remember the book.

     BARABAS. Marry, will I, sir.
          [Exeunt KATHARlNE and MATHIAS.]

     FIRST OFFICER. Come, I have made a reasonable market; let's away.
          [Exeunt OFFICERS with SLAVES.]

     BARABAS. Now let me know thy name, and therewithal
     Thy birth, condition, and profession.

     ITHAMORE. Faith, sir, my birth is but mean; my name's Ithamore;
     my profession what you please.

     BARABAS. Hast thou no trade? then listen to my words,
     And I will teach [thee] that shall stick by thee:
     First, be thou void of these affections,
     Compassion, love, vain hope, and heartless fear;
     Be mov'd at nothing, see thou pity none,
     But to thyself smile when the Christians moan.

     ITHAMORE. O, brave, master! [78] I worship your nose [79] for this.

     BARABAS. As for myself, I walk abroad o' nights,
     And kill sick people groaning under walls:
     Sometimes I go about and poison wells;
     And now and then, to cherish Christian thieves,
     I am content to lose some of my crowns,
     That I may, walking in my gallery,
     See 'em go pinion'd along by my door.
     Being young, I studied physic, and began
     To practice first upon the Italian;
     There I enrich'd the priests with burials,
     And always kept the sexton's arms in ure [80]
     With digging graves and ringing dead men's knells:
     And, after that, was I an engineer,
     And in the wars 'twixt France and Germany,
     Under pretence of helping Charles the Fifth,
     Slew friend and enemy with my stratagems:
     Then, after that, was I an usurer,
     And with extorting, cozening, forfeiting,
     And tricks belonging unto brokery,
     I fill'd the gaols with bankrupts in a year,
     And with young orphans planted hospitals;
     And every moon made some or other mad,
     And now and then one hang himself for grief,
     Pinning upon his breast a long great scroll
     How I with interest tormented him.
     But mark how I am blest for plaguing them;--
     I have as much coin as will buy the town.
     But tell me now, how hast thou spent thy time?

     ITHAMORE. Faith, master,
     In setting Christian villages on fire,
     Chaining of eunuchs, binding galley-slaves.
     One time I was an hostler in an inn,
     And in the night-time secretly would I steal
     To travellers' chambers, and there cut their throats:
     Once at Jerusalem, where the pilgrims kneel'd,
     I strewed powder on the marble stones,
     And therewithal their knees would rankle so,
     That I have laugh'd a-good [81] to see the cripples
     Go limping home to Christendom on stilts.

     BARABAS. Why, this is something:  make account of me
     As of thy fellow; we are villains both;
     Both circumcised; we hate Christians both:
     Be true and secret; thou shalt want no gold.
     But stand aside; here comes Don Lodowick.

          Enter LODOWICK. [82]

     LODOWICK. O, Barabas, well met;
     Where is the diamond you told me of?

     BARABAS. I have it for you, sir:  please you walk in with me.--
     What, ho, Abigail! open the door, I say!

          Enter ABIGAIL, with letters.

     ABIGAIL. In good time, father; here are letters come
     ]From Ormus, and the post stays here within.

     BARABAS. Give me the letters.--Daughter, do you hear?
     Entertain Lodowick, the governor's son,
     With all the courtesy you can afford,
     Provided that you keep your maidenhead:
     Use him as if he were a Philistine;
     Dissemble, swear, protest, vow love to him: [83]
     He is not of the seed of Abraham.--
          [Aside to her.]
     I am a little busy, sir; pray, pardon me.--
     Abigail, bid him welcome for my sake.

     ABIGAIL. For your sake and his own he's welcome hither.

     BARABAS. Daughter, a word more:  kiss him, speak him fair,
     And like a cunning Jew so cast about,
     That ye be both made sure [84] ere you come out.
          [Aside to her.]

     ABIGAIL. O father, Don Mathias is my love!

     BARABAS. I know it:  yet, I say, make love to him;
     Do, it is requisite it should be so.--
          [Aside to her.]
     Nay, on my life, it is my factor's hand;
     But go you in, I'll think upon the account.
          [Exeunt ABIGAIL and LODOWICK into the house.]
     The account is made, for Lodovico [85] dies.
     My factor sends me word a merchant's fled
     That owes me for a hundred tun of wine:
     I weigh it thus much[snapping his fingers]!  I have wealth enough;
     For now by this has he kiss'd Abigail,
     And she vows love to him, and he to her.
     As sure as heaven rain'd manna for the Jews,
     So sure shall he and Don Mathias die:
     His father was my chiefest enemy.

          Enter MATHIAS.

     Whither goes Don Mathias? stay a while.

     MATHIAS. Whither, but to my fair love Abigail?

     BARABAS. Thou know'st, and heaven can witness it is true,
     That I intend my daughter shall be thine.

     MATHIAS. Ay, Barabas, or else thou wrong'st me much.

     BARABAS. O, heaven forbid I should have such a thought!
     Pardon me though I weep:  the governor's son
     Will, whether I will or no, have Abigail;
     He sends her letters, bracelets, jewels, rings.

     MATHIAS. Does she receive them?

     BARABAS. She! no, Mathias, no, but sends them back;
     And, when he comes, she locks herself up fast;
     Yet through the key-hole will he talk to her,
     While she runs to the window, looking out
     When you should come and hale him from the door.

     MATHIAS. O treacherous Lodowick!

     BARABAS. Even now, as I came home, he slipt me in,
     And I am sure he is with Abigail.

     MATHIAS. I'll rouse him thence.

     BARABAS. Not for all Malta; therefore sheathe your sword;
     If you love me, no quarrels in my house;
     But steal you in, and seem to see him not:
     I'll give him such a warning ere he goes,
     As he shall have small hopes of Abigail.
     Away, for here they come.

          Re-enter LODOWICK and ABIGAIL.

     MATHIAS. What, hand in hand! I cannot suffer this.

     BARABAS. Mathias, as thou lov'st me, not a word.

     MATHIAS. Well, let it pass; another time shall serve.
          [Exit into the house.]

     LODOWICK. Barabas, is not that the widow's son?

     BARABAS. Ay, and take heed, for he hath sworn your death.

     LODOWICK. My death! what, is the base-born peasant mad?

     BARABAS. No, no; but happily [86] he stands in fear
     Of that which you, I think, ne'er dream upon,--
     My daughter here, a paltry silly girl.

     LODOWICK. Why, loves she Don Mathias?

     BARABAS. Doth she not with her smiling answer you?

     ABIGAIL. He has my heart; I smile against my will.
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. Barabas, thou know'st I have lov'd thy daughter long.

     BARABAS. And so has she done you, even from a child.

     LODOWICK. And now I can no longer hold my mind.

     BARABAS. Nor I the affection that I bear to you.

     LODOWICK. This is thy diamond; tell me, shall I have it?

     BARABAS. Win it, and wear it; it is yet unsoil'd. [87]
     O, but I know your lordship would disdain
     To marry with the daughter of a Jew:
     And yet I'll give her many a golden cross [88]
     With Christian posies round about the ring.

     LODOWICK. 'Tis not thy wealth, but her that I esteem;
     Yet crave I thy consent.

     BARABAS. And mine you have; yet let me talk to her.--
     This offspring of Cain, this Jebusite,
     That never tasted of the Passover,
     Nor e'er shall see the land of Canaan,
     Nor our Messias that is yet to come;
     This gentle maggot, Lodowick, I mean,
     Must be deluded:  let him have thy hand,
     But keep thy heart till Don Mathias comes.
          [Aside to her.]

     ABIGAIL. What, shall I be betroth'd to Lodowick?

     BARABAS. It's no sin to deceive a Christian;
     For they themselves hold it a principle,
     Faith is not to be held with heretics:
     But all are heretics that are not Jews;
     This follows well, and therefore, daughter, fear not.--
          [Aside to her.]
     I have entreated her, and she will grant.

     LODOWICK. Then, gentle Abigail, plight thy faith to me.

     ABIGAIL. I cannot choose, seeing my father bids:
     Nothing but death shall part my love and me.

     LODOWICK. Now have I that for which my soul hath long'd.

     BARABAS. So have not I; but yet I hope I shall.
          [Aside.]

     ABIGAIL. O wretched Abigail, what hast thou [89] done?
          [Aside.]

     LODOWICK. Why on the sudden is your colour chang'd?

     ABIGAIL. I know not:  but farewell; I must be gone.

     BARABAS. Stay her, but let her not speak one word more.

     LODOWICK. Mute o' the sudden! here's a sudden change.

     BARABAS. O, muse not at it; 'tis the Hebrews' guise,
     That maidens new-betroth'd should weep a while:
     Trouble her not; sweet Lodowick, depart:
     She is thy wife, and thou shalt be mine heir.

     LODOWICK. O, is't the custom? then I am resolv'd: [90]
     But rather let the brightsome heavens be dim,
     And nature's beauty choke with stifling clouds,
     Than my fair Abigail should frown on me.--
     There comes the villain; now I'll be reveng'd.

          Re-enter MATHIAS.

     BARABAS. Be quiet, Lodowick; it is enough
     That I have made thee sure to Abigail.

     LODOWICK. Well, let him go.
          [Exit.]

     BARABAS. Well, but for me, as you went in at doors
     You had been stabb'd:  but not a word on't now;
     Here must no speeches pass, nor swords be drawn.

     MATHIAS. Suffer me, Barabas, but to follow him.

     BARABAS. No; so shall I, if any hurt be done,
     Be made an accessary of your deeds:
     Revenge it on him when you meet him next.

     MATHIAS. For this I'll have his heart.

     BARABAS. Do so.  Lo, here I give thee Abigail!

     MATHIAS. What greater gift can poor Mathias have?
     Shall Lodowick rob me of so fair a love?
     My life is not so dear as Abigail.

     BARABAS. My heart misgives me, that, to cross your love,
     He's with your mother; therefore after him.

     MATHIAS. What, is he gone unto my mother?

     BARABAS. Nay, if you will, stay till she comes herself.

     MATHIAS. I cannot stay; for, if my mother come,
     She'll die with grief.
          [Exit.]

     ABIGAIL. I cannot take my leave of him for tears.
     Father, why have you thus incens'd them both?

     BARABAS. What's that to thee?

     ABIGAIL. I'll make 'em friends again.

     BARABAS.
     You'll make 'em friends! are there not Jews enow in Malta,
     But thou must dote upon a Christian?

     ABIGAIL. I will have Don Mathias; he is my love.

     BARABAS. Yes, you shall have him.--Go, put her in.

     ITHAMORE. Ay, I'll put her in.
          [Puts in ABIGAIL.]

     BARABAS. Now tell me, Ithamore, how lik'st thou this?

     ITHAMORE. Faith, master, I think by this
     You purchase both their lives:  is it not so?

     BARABAS. True; and it shall be cunningly perform'd.

     ITHAMORE. O, master, that I might have a hand in this!

     BARABAS. Ay, so thou shalt; 'tis thou must do the deed:
     Take this, and bear it to Mathias straight,
          [Giving a letter.]
     And tell him that it comes from Lodowick.

     ITHAMORE. 'Tis poison'd, is it not?

     BARABAS. No, no; and yet it might be done that way:
     It is a challenge feign'd from Lodowick.

     ITHAMORE. Fear not; I will so set his heart a-fire,
     That he shall verily think it comes from him.

     BARABAS. I cannot choose but like thy readiness:
     Yet be not rash, but do it cunningly.

     ITHAMORE. As I behave myself in this, employ me hereafter.

     BARABAS. Away, then!
          [Exit ITHAMORE.]
     So; now will I go in to Lodowick,
     And, like a cunning spirit, feign some lie,
     Till I have set 'em both at enmity.
          [Exit.]




ACT III.

          Enter BELLAMIRA. [91]

     BELLAMIRA. Since this town was besieg'd, my gain grows cold:
     The time has been, that but for one bare night
     A hundred ducats have been freely given;
     But now against my will I must be chaste:
     And yet I know my beauty doth not fail.
     ]From Venice merchants, and from Padua
     Were wont to come rare-witted gentlemen,
     Scholars I mean, learned and liberal;
     And now, save Pilia-Borza, comes there none,
     And he is very seldom from my house;
     And here he comes.

          Enter PILIA-BORZA.

     PILIA-BORZA.
     Hold thee, wench, there's something for thee to spend.
          [Shewing a bag of silver.]

     BELLAMIRA. 'Tis silver; I disdain it.

     PILIA-BORZA. Ay, but the Jew has gold,
     And I will have it, or it shall go hard.

     BELLAMIRA. Tell me, how cam'st thou by this?

     PILIA-BORZA. Faith, walking the back-lanes, through the gardens,
     I chanced to cast mine eye up to the Jew's counting-house, where
     I saw some bags of money, and in the night I clambered up with
     my hooks; and, as I was taking my choice, I heard a rumbling in
     the house; so I took only this, and run my way.--But here's the
     Jew's man.

     BELLAMIRA. Hide the bag.

          Enter ITHAMORE.

     PILIA-BORZA. Look not towards him, let's away.  Zoons, what a
     looking thou keepest! thou'lt betray's anon.
          [Exeunt BELLAMIRA and PILIA-BORZA.]

     ITHAMORE. O, the sweetest face that ever I beheld!  I know she
     is a courtezan by her attire:  now would I give a hundred of
     the Jew's crowns that I had such a concubine.
     Well, I have deliver'd the challenge in such sort,
     As meet they will, and fighting die,--brave sport!
          [Exit.]

          Enter MATHIAS.

     MATHIAS. This is the place: [92]  now Abigail shall see
     Whether Mathias holds her dear or no.

          Enter LODOWICK.

     What, dares the villain write in such base terms?
          [Looking at a letter.]

     LODOWICK. I did it; and revenge it, if thou dar'st!
          [They fight.]

          Enter BARABAS above.

     BARABAS. O, bravely fought! and yet they thrust not home.
     Now, Lodovico! [93] now, Mathias!--So;
          [Both fall.]
     So, now they have shew'd themselves to be tall [94] fellows.

          [Cries within] Part 'em, part 'em!

     BARABAS. Ay, part 'em now they are dead.  Farewell, farewell!
          [Exit above.]

          Enter FERNEZE, KATHARINE, and ATTENDANTS.

     FERNEZE. What sight is this! [95] my Lodovico [96] slain!
     These arms of mine shall be thy sepulchre. [97]

     KATHARINE. Who is this? my son Mathias slain!

     FERNEZE. O Lodowick, hadst thou perish'd by the Turk,
     Wretched Ferneze might have veng'd thy death!

     KATHARINE. Thy son slew mine, and I'll revenge his death.

     FERNEZE. Look, Katharine, look! thy son gave mine these wounds.

     KATHARINE. O, leave to grieve me!  I am griev'd enough.

     FERNEZE. O, that my sighs could turn to lively breath,
     And these my tears to blood, that he might live!

     KATHARINE. Who made them enemies?

     FERNEZE. I know not; and that grieves me most of all.

     KATHARINE. My son lov'd thine.

     FERNEZE. And so did Lodowick him.

     KATHARINE. Lend me that weapon that did kill my son,
     And it shall murder me.

     FERNEZE. Nay, madam, stay; that weapon was my son's,
     And on that rather should Ferneze die.

     KATHARINE. Hold; let's inquire the causers of their deaths,
     That we may venge their blood upon their heads.

     FERNEZE. Then take them up, and let them be interr'd
     Within one sacred monument of stone;
     Upon which altar I will offer up
     My daily sacrifice of sighs and tears,
     And with my prayers pierce impartial heavens,
     Till they [reveal] the causers of our smarts,
     Which forc'd their hands divide united hearts.
     Come, Katharine; [98] our losses equal are;
     Then of true grief let us take equal share.
          [Exeunt with the bodies.]

          Enter ITHAMORE. [99]

     ITHAMORE. Why, was there ever seen such villany,
     So neatly plotted, and so well perform'd?
     Both held in hand, [100] and flatly both beguil'd?

          Enter ABIGAIL.

     ABIGAIL. Why, how now, Ithamore! why laugh'st thou so?

     ITHAMORE. O mistress! ha, ha, ha!

     ABIGAIL. Why, what ail'st thou?

     ITHAMORE. O, my master!

     ABIGAIL. Ha!

     ITHAMORE. O mistress, I have the bravest, gravest, secret,
     subtle, bottle-nosed [101] knave to my master, that ever
     gentleman had!

     ABIGAIL. Say, knave, why rail'st upon my father thus?

     ITHAMORE. O, my master has the bravest policy!

     ABIGAIL. Wherein?

     ITHAMORE. Why, know you not?

     ABIGAIL. Why, no.

     ITHAMORE.
     Know you not of Mathia[s'] and Don Lodowick['s] disaster?

     ABIGAIL. No:  what was it?

     ITHAMORE. Why, the devil inverted a challenge, my master
     writ it, and I carried it, first to Lodowick, and imprimis
     to Mathia[s];
     And then they met, [and], as the story says,
     In doleful wise they ended both their days.

     ABIGAIL. And was my father furtherer of their deaths?

     ITHAMORE. Am I Ithamore?

     ABIGAIL. Yes.

     ITHAMORE.
     So sure did your father write, and I carry the challenge.

     ABIGAIL. Well, Ithamore, let me request thee this;
     Go to the new-made nunnery, and inquire
     For any of the friars of Saint Jaques, [102]
     And say, I pray them come and speak with me.

     ITHAMORE. I pray, mistress, will you answer me to one question?

     ABIGAIL. Well, sirrah, what is't?

     ITHAMORE. A very feeling one:  have not the nuns fine sport with
     the friars now and then?

     ABIGAIL. Go to, Sirrah Sauce! is this your question? get ye gone.

     ITHAMORE. I will, forsooth, mistress.
          [Exit.]

     ABIGAIL. Hard-hearted father, unkind Barabas!
     Was this the pursuit of thy policy,
     To make me shew them favour severally,
     That by my favour they should both be slain?
     Admit thou lov'dst not Lodowick for his sire, [103]
     Yet Don Mathias ne'er offended thee:
     But thou wert set upon extreme revenge,
     Because the prior dispossess'd thee once,
     And couldst not venge it but upon his son;
     Nor on his son but by Mathias' means;
     Nor on Mathias but by murdering me:
     But I perceive there is no love on earth,
     Pity in Jews, nor piety in Turks.--
     But here comes cursed Ithamore with the friar.

          Re-enter ITHAMORE with FRIAR JACOMO.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Virgo, salve.

     ITHAMORE. When duck you?

     ABIGAIL. Welcome, grave friar.--Ithamore, be gone.
          [Exit ITHAMORE.]
     Know, holy sir, I am bold to solicit thee.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Wherein?

     ABIGAIL. To get me be admitted for a nun.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Why, Abigail, it is not yet long since
     That I did labour thy admission,
     And then thou didst not like that holy life.

     ABIGAIL. Then were my thoughts so frail and unconfirm'd
     As [104] I was chain'd to follies of the world:
     But now experience, purchased with grief,
     Has made me see the difference of things.
     My sinful soul, alas, hath pac'd too long
     The fatal labyrinth of misbelief,
     Far from the sun that gives eternal life!

     FRIAR JACOMO. Who taught thee this?

     ABIGAIL. The abbess of the house,
     Whose zealous admonition I embrace:
     O, therefore, Jacomo, let me be one,
     Although unworthy, of that sisterhood!

     FRIAR JACOMO. Abigail, I will:  but see thou change no more,
     For that will be most heavy to thy soul.

     ABIGAIL. That was my father's fault.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Thy father's! how?

     ABIGAIL. Nay, you shall pardon me.--O Barabas,
     Though thou deservest hardly at my hands,
     Yet never shall these lips bewray thy life!
          [Aside.]

     FRIAR JACOMO. Come, shall we go?

     ABIGAIL. My duty waits on you.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter BARABAS, [105] reading a letter.

     BARABAS. What, Abigail become a nun again!
     False and unkind! what, hast thou lost thy father?
     And, all unknown and unconstrain'd of me,
     Art thou again got to the nunnery?
     Now here she writes, and wills me to repent:
     Repentance! Spurca! what pretendeth [106] this?
     I fear she knows--'tis so--of my device
     In Don Mathias' and Lodovico's deaths:
     If so, 'tis time that it be seen into;
     For she that varies from me in belief,
     Gives great presumption that she loves me not,
     Or, loving, doth dislike of something done.--
     But who comes here?

          Enter ITHAMORE.

                         O Ithamore, come near;
     Come near, my love; come near, thy master's life,
     My trusty servant, nay, my second self; [107]
     For I have now no hope but even in thee,
     And on that hope my happiness is built.
     When saw'st thou Abigail?

     ITHAMORE. To-day.

     BARABAS. With whom?

     ITHAMORE. A friar.

     BARABAS. A friar! false villain, he hath done the deed.

     ITHAMORE. How, sir!

     BARABAS. Why, made mine Abigail a nun.

     ITHAMORE. That's no lie; for she sent me for him.

     BARABAS. O unhappy day!
     False, credulous, inconstant Abigail!
     But let 'em go:  and, Ithamore, from hence
     Ne'er shall she grieve me more with her disgrace;
     Ne'er shall she live to inherit aught of mine,
     Be bless'd of me, nor come within my gates,
     But perish underneath my bitter curse,
     Like Cain by Adam for his brother's death.

     ITHAMORE. O master--

     BARABAS. Ithamore, entreat not for her; I am mov'd,
     And she is hateful to my soul and me:
     And, 'less [108] thou yield to this that I entreat,
     I cannot think but that thou hat'st my life.

     ITHAMORE. Who, I, master? why, I'll run to some rock,
     And throw myself headlong into the sea;
     Why, I'll do any thing for your sweet sake.

     BARABAS. O trusty Ithamore! no servant, but my friend!
     I here adopt thee for mine only heir:
     All that I have is thine when I am dead;
     And, whilst I live, use half; spend as myself;
     Here, take my keys,--I'll give 'em thee anon;
     Go buy thee garments; but thou shalt not want:
     Only know this, that thus thou art to do--
     But first go fetch me in the pot of rice
     That for our supper stands upon the fire.

     ITHAMORE. I hold my head, my master's hungry [Aside].--I go, sir.
          [Exit.]

     BARABAS. Thus every villain ambles after wealth,
     Although he ne'er be richer than in hope:--
     But, husht!

          Re-enter ITHAMORE with the pot.

     ITHAMORE. Here 'tis, master.

     BARABAS. Well said, [109] Ithamore!  What, hast thou brought
     The ladle with thee too?

     ITHAMORE. Yes, sir; the proverb says, [110] he that eats with the
     devil had need of a long spoon; I have brought you a ladle.

     BARABAS. Very well, Ithamore; then now be secret;
     And, for thy sake, whom I so dearly love,
     Now shalt thou see the death of Abigail,
     That thou mayst freely live to be my heir.

     ITHAMORE. Why, master, will you poison her with a mess of rice-
     porridge? that will preserve life, make her round and plump, and
     batten [111] more than you are aware.

     BARABAS. Ay, but, Ithamore, seest thou this?
     It is a precious powder that I bought
     Of an Italian, in Ancona, once,
     Whose operation is to bind, infect,
     And poison deeply, yet not appear
     In forty hours after it is ta'en.

     ITHAMORE. How, master?

     BARABAS. Thus, Ithamore:
     This even they use in Malta here,--'tis call'd
     Saint Jaques' Even,--and then, I say, they use
     To send their alms unto the nunneries:
     Among the rest, bear this, and set it there:
     There's a dark entry where they take it in,
     Where they must neither see the messenger,
     Nor make inquiry who hath sent it them.

     ITHAMORE. How so?

     BARABAS. Belike there is some ceremony in't.
     There, Ithamore, must thou go place this pot: [112]
     Stay; let me spice it first.

     ITHAMORE. Pray, do, and let me help you, master.
     Pray, let me taste first.

     BARABAS. Prithee, do.[ITHAMORE tastes.]  What say'st thou now?

     ITHAMORE. Troth, master, I'm loath such a pot of pottage should
     be spoiled.

     BARABAS. Peace, Ithamore! 'tis better so than spar'd.
          [Puts the powder into the pot.]
     Assure thyself thou shalt have broth by the eye: [113]
     My purse, my coffer, and myself is thine.

     ITHAMORE. Well, master, I go.

     BARABAS. Stay; first let me stir it, Ithamore.
     As fatal be it to her as the draught
     Of which great Alexander drunk, and died;
     And with her let it work like Borgia's wine,
     Whereof his sire the Pope was poisoned!
     In few, [114] the blood of Hydra, Lerna's bane,
     The juice of hebon, [115] and Cocytus' breath,
     And all the poisons of the Stygian pool,
     Break from the fiery kingdom, and in this
     Vomit your venom, and envenom her
     That, like a fiend, hath left her father thus!

     ITHAMORE. What a blessing has he given't! was ever pot of
     rice-porridge so sauced? [Aside].--What shall I do with it?

     BARABAS. O my sweet Ithamore, go set it down;
     And come again so soon as thou hast done,
     For I have other business for thee.

     ITHAMORE. Here's a drench to poison a whole stable of Flanders
     mares:  I'll carry't to the nuns with a powder.

     BARABAS. And the horse-pestilence to boot:  away!

     ITHAMORE. I am gone:
     Pay me my wages, for my work is done.
          [Exit with the pot.]

     BARABAS. I'll pay thee with a vengeance, Ithamore!
          [Exit.]

          Enter FERNEZE, [116] MARTIN DEL BOSCO, KNIGHTS, and BASSO.

     FERNEZE. Welcome, great basso: [117]  how fares Calymath?
     What wind drives you thus into Malta-road?

     BASSO. The wind that bloweth all the world besides,
     Desire of gold.

     FERNEZE. Desire of gold, great sir!
     That's to be gotten in the Western Inde:
     In Malta are no golden minerals.

     BASSO. To you of Malta thus saith Calymath:
     The time you took for respite is at hand
     For the performance of your promise pass'd;
     And for the tribute-money I am sent.

     FERNEZE. Basso, in brief, shalt have no tribute here,
     Nor shall the heathens live upon our spoil:
     First will we raze the city-walls ourselves,
     Lay waste the island, hew the temples down,
     And, shipping off our goods to Sicily,
     Open an entrance for the wasteful sea,
     Whose billows, beating the resistless banks, [118]
     Shall overflow it with their refluence.

     BASSO. Well, governor, since thou hast broke the league
     By flat denial of the promis'd tribute,
     Talk not of razing down your city-walls;
     You shall not need trouble yourselves so far,
     For Selim Calymath shall come himself,
     And with brass bullets batter down your towers,
     And turn proud Malta to a wilderness,
     For these intolerable wrongs of yours:
     And so, farewell.

     FERNEZE. Farewell.
          [Exit BASSO.]
     And now, you men of Malta, look about,
     And let's provide to welcome Calymath:
     Close your port-cullis, charge your basilisks, [119]
     And, as you profitably take up arms,
     So now courageously encounter them,
     For by this answer broken is the league,
     And naught is to be look'd for now but wars,
     And naught to us more welcome is than wars.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter FRIAR JACOMO [120] and FRIAR BARNARDINE.

     FRIAR JACOMO. O brother, brother, all the nuns are sick,
     And physic will not help them! they must die.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. The abbess sent for me to be confess'd:
     O, what a sad confession will there be!

     FRIAR JACOMO. And so did fair Maria send for me:
     I'll to her lodging; hereabouts she lies.
          [Exit.]

          Enter ABIGAIL.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. What, all dead, save only Abigail!

     ABIGAIL. And I shall die too, for I feel death coming.
     Where is the friar that convers'd with me? [121]

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. O, he is gone to see the other nuns.

     ABIGAIL. I sent for him; but, seeing you are come,
     Be you my ghostly father:  and first know,
     That in this house I liv'd religiously,
     Chaste, and devout, much sorrowing for my sins;
     But, ere I came--

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. What then?

     ABIGAIL. I did offend high heaven so grievously
     As I am almost desperate for my sins;
     And one offense torments me more than all.
     You knew Mathias and Don Lodowick?

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Yes; what of them?

     ABIGAIL. My father did contract me to 'em both;
     First to Don Lodowick:  him I never lov'd;
     Mathias was the man that I held dear,
     And for his sake did I become a nun.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. So:  say how was their end?

     ABIGAIL. Both, jealous of my love, envied [122] each other;
     And by my father's practice, [123] which is there
          [Gives writing.]
     Set down at large, the gallants were both slain.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. O, monstrous villany!

     ABIGAIL. To work my peace, this I confess to thee:
     Reveal it not; for then my father dies.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Know that confession must not be reveal'd;
     The canon-law forbids it, and the priest
     That makes it known, being degraded first,
     Shall be condemn'd, and then sent to the fire.

     ABIGAIL. So I have heard; pray, therefore, keep it close.
     Death seizeth on my heart:  ah, gentle friar,
     Convert my father that he may be sav'd,
     And witness that I die a Christian!
          [Dies.]

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Ay, and a virgin too; that grieves me most.
     But I must to the Jew, and exclaim on him,
     And make him stand in fear of me.

          Re-enter FRIAR JACOMO.

     FRIAR JACOMO. O brother, all the nuns are dead! let's bury them.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. First help to bury this; then go with me,
     And help me to exclaim against the Jew.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Why, what has he done?

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. A thing that makes me tremble to unfold.

     FRIAR JACOMO. What, has he crucified a child? [124]

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. No, but a worse thing: 'twas told me in shrift;
     Thou know'st 'tis death, an if it be reveal'd.
     Come, let's away.
          [Exeunt.]




ACT IV.

          Enter BARABAS [125] and ITHAMORE.  Bells within.

     BARABAS. There is no music to [126] a Christian's knell:
     How sweet the bells ring, now the nuns are dead,
     That sound at other times like tinkers' pans!
     I was afraid the poison had not wrought,
     Or, though it wrought, it would have done no good,
     For every year they swell, and yet they live:
     Now all are dead, not one remains alive.

     ITHAMORE.
     That's brave, master:  but think you it will not be known?

     BARABAS. How can it, if we two be secret?

     ITHAMORE. For my part, fear you not.

     BARABAS. I'd cut thy throat, if I did.

     ITHAMORE. And reason too.
     But here's a royal monastery hard by;
     Good master, let me poison all the monks.

     BARABAS. Thou shalt not need; for, now the nuns are dead,
     They'll die with grief.

     ITHAMORE. Do you not sorrow for your daughter's death?

     BARABAS. No, but I grieve because she liv'd so long,
     An Hebrew born, and would become a Christian:
     Cazzo, [127] diabolo!

     ITHAMORE.
     Look, look, master; here come two religious caterpillars.

          Enter FRIAR JACOMO and FRIAR BARNARDINE.

     BARABAS. I smelt 'em ere they came.

     ITHAMORE. God-a-mercy, nose! [128] Come, let's begone.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Stay, wicked Jew; repent, I say, and stay.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Thou hast offended, therefore must be damn'd.

     BARABAS. I fear they know we sent the poison'd broth.

     ITHAMORE. And so do I, master; therefore speak 'em fair.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Barabas, thou hast--

     FRIAR JACOMO. Ay, that thou hast--

     BARABAS. True, I have money; what though I have?

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Thou art a--

     FRIAR JACOMO. Ay, that thou art, a--

     BARABAS. What needs all this? I know I am a Jew.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Thy daughter--

     FRIAR JACOMO. Ay, thy daughter--

     BARABAS. O, speak not of her! then I die with grief.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Remember that--

     FRIAR JACOMO. Ay, remember that--

     BARABAS. I must needs say that I have been a great usurer.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Thou hast committed--

     BARABAS. Fornication:  but that was in another country;
     And besides, the wench is dead.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Ay, but, Barabas,
     Remember Mathias and Don Lodowick.

     BARABAS. Why, what of them?

     FRIAR BARNARDINE.
     I will not say that by a forged challenge they met.

     BARABAS. She has confess'd, and we are both undone,
     My bosom inmate! [129] but I must dissemble.--
          [Aside to ITHAMORE.]
     O holy friars, the burden of my sins
     Lie heavy [130] on my soul! then, pray you, tell me,
     Is't not too late now to turn Christian?
     I have been zealous in the Jewish faith,
     Hard-hearted to the poor, a covetous wretch,
     That would for lucre's sake have sold my soul;
     A hundred for a hundred I have ta'en;
     And now for store of wealth may I compare
     With all the Jews in Malta:  but what is wealth?
     I am a Jew, and therefore am I lost.
     Would penance serve [to atone] for this my sin,
     I could afford to whip myself to death,--

     ITHAMORE. And so could I; but penance will not serve.

     BARABAS. To fast, to pray, and wear a shirt of hair,
     And on my knees creep to Jerusalem.
     Cellars of wine, and sollars [131] full of wheat,
     Warehouses stuff'd with spices and with drugs,
     Whole chests of gold in bullion and in coin,
     Besides, I know not how much weight in pearl
     Orient and round, have I within my house;
     At Alexandria merchandise untold; [132]
     But yesterday two ships went from this town,
     Their voyage will be worth ten thousand crowns;
     In Florence, Venice, Antwerp, London, Seville,
     Frankfort, Lubeck, Moscow, and where not,
     Have I debts owing; and, in most of these,
     Great sums of money lying in the banco;
     All this I'll give to some religious house,
     So I may be baptiz'd, and live therein.

     FRIAR JACOMO. O good Barabas, come to our house!

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. O, no, good Barabas, come to our house!
     And, Barabas, you know--

     BARABAS. I know that I have highly sinn'd:
     You shall convert me, you shall have all my wealth.

     FRIAR JACOMO. O Barabas, their laws are strict!

     BARABAS. I know they are; and I will be with you.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. They wear no shirts, and they go bare-foot too.

     BARABAS. Then 'tis not for me; and I am resolv'd
     You shall confess me, and have all my goods.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Good Barabas, come to me.

     BARABAS. You see I answer him, and yet he stays;
     Rid him away, and go you home with me.

     FRIAR JACOMO. I'll be with you to-night.

     BARABAS. Come to my house at one o'clock this night.

     FRIAR JACOMO. You hear your answer, and you may be gone.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Why, go, get you away.

     FRIAR JACOMO. I will not go for thee.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. Not! then I'll make thee go.

     FRIAR JACOMO. How! dost call me rogue?

          [They fight.]

     ITHAMORE. Part 'em, master, part 'em.

     BARABAS. This is mere frailty:  brethren, be content.--
     Friar Barnardine, go you with Ithamore:
     You know my mind; let me alone with him.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Why does he go to thy house? let him be gone. [133]

     BARABAS. I'll give him something, and so stop his mouth.
          [Exit ITHAMORE with Friar BARNARDINE.]
     I never heard of any man but he
     Malign'd the order of the Jacobins:
     But do you think that I believe his words?
     Why, brother, you converted Abigail;
     And I am bound in charity to requite it,
     And so I will.  O Jacomo, fail not, but come.

     FRIAR JACOMO. But, Barabas, who shall be your godfathers?
     For presently you shall be shriv'd.

     BARABAS. Marry, the Turk [134] shall be one of my godfathers,
     But not a word to any of your covent. [135]

     FRIAR JACOMO. I warrant thee, Barabas.
          [Exit.]

     BARABAS. So, now the fear is past, and I am safe;
     For he that shriv'd her is within my house:
     What, if I murder'd him ere Jacomo comes?
     Now I have such a plot for both their lives,
     As never Jew nor Christian knew the like:
     One turn'd my daughter, therefore he shall die;
     The other knows enough to have my life,
     Therefore 'tis not requisite he should live. [136]
     But are not both these wise men, to suppose
     That I will leave my house, my goods, and all,
     To fast and be well whipt?  I'll none of that.
     Now, Friar Barnardine, I come to you:
     I'll feast you, lodge you, give you fair [137] words,
     And, after that, I and my trusty Turk--
     No more, but so:  it must and shall be done. [138]

          Enter ITHAMORE.

     Ithamore, tell me, is the friar asleep?

     ITHAMORE. Yes; and I know not what the reason is,
     Do what I can, he will not strip himself,
     Nor go to bed, but sleeps in his own clothes:
     I fear me he mistrusts what we intend.

     BARABAS. No; 'tis an order which the friars use:
     Yet, if he knew our meanings, could he scape?

     ITHAMORE. No, none can hear him, cry he ne'er so loud.

     BARABAS. Why, true; therefore did I place him there:
     The other chambers open towards the street.

     ITHAMORE. You loiter, master; wherefore stay we thus?
     O, how I long to see him shake his heels!

     BARABAS. Come on, sirrah:
     Off with your girdle; make a handsome noose.--
          [ITHAMORE takes off his girdle, and ties a noose on it.]
     Friar, awake! [139]
          [They put the noose round the FRIAR'S neck.]

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. What, do you mean to strangle me?

     ITHAMORE. Yes, 'cause you use to confess.

     BARABAS. Blame not us, but the proverb,--Confess and be
     hanged.--Pull hard.

     FRIAR BARNARDINE. What, will you have [140] my life?

     BARABAS. Pull hard, I say.--You would have had my goods.

     ITHAMORE. Ay, and our lives too:--therefore pull amain.
          [They strangle the FRIAR.]
     'Tis neatly done, sir; here's no print at all.

     BARABAS. Then is it as it should be.  Take him up.

     ITHAMORE. Nay, master, be ruled by me a little.  [Takes the body,
     sets it upright against the wall, and puts a staff in its hand.]
     So, let him lean upon his staff; excellent! he stands as if he
     were begging of bacon.

     BARABAS. Who would not think but that this friar liv'd?
     What time o' night is't now, sweet Ithamore?

     ITHAMORE. Towards one. [141]

     BARABAS. Then will not Jacomo be long from hence.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter FRIAR JACOMO. [142]

     FRIAR JACOMO. This is the hour wherein I shall proceed; [143]
     O happy hour, wherein I shall convert
     An infidel, and bring his gold into our treasury!
     But soft! is not this Barnardine? it is;
     And, understanding I should come this way,
     Stands here o' purpose, meaning me some wrong,
     And intercept my going to the Jew.--
     Barnardine!
     Wilt thou not speak? thou think'st I see thee not;
     Away, I'd wish thee, and let me go by:
     No, wilt thou not? nay, then, I'll force my way;
     And, see, a staff stands ready for the purpose.
     As thou lik'st that, stop me another time!
          [Takes the staff, and strikes down the body.]

          Enter BARABAS and ITHAMORE.

     BARABAS. Why, how now, Jacomo! what hast thou done?

     FRIAR JACOMO. Why, stricken him that would have struck at me.

     BARABAS. Who is it? Barnardine! now, out, alas, he is slain!

     ITHAMORE. Ay, master, he's slain; look how his brains drop out
     on's [144] nose.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Good sirs, I have done't:  but nobody knows it but
     you two; I may escape.

     BARABAS. So might my man and I hang with you for company.

     ITHAMORE. No; let us bear him to the magistrates.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Good Barabas, let me go.

     BARABAS. No, pardon me; the law must have his course:
     I must be forc'd to give in evidence,
     That, being importun'd by this Barnardine
     To be a Christian, I shut him out,
     And there he sate:  now I, to keep my word,
     And give my goods and substance to your house,
     Was up thus early, with intent to go
     Unto your friary, because you stay'd.

     ITHAMORE. Fie upon 'em! master, will you turn Christian, when
     holy friars turn devils and murder one another?

     BARABAS. No; for this example I'll remain a Jew:
     Heaven bless me! what, a friar a murderer!
     When shall you see a Jew commit the like?

     ITHAMORE. Why, a Turk could ha' done no more.

     BARABAS. To-morrow is the sessions; you shall to it.--
     Come, Ithamore, let's help to take him hence.

     FRIAR JACOMO. Villains, I am a sacred person; touch me not.

     BARABAS. The law shall touch you; we'll but lead you, we:
     'Las, I could weep at your calamity!--
     Take in the staff too, for that must be shown:
     Law wills that each particular be known.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter BELLAMIRA [145] and PILIA-BORZA.

     BELLAMIRA. Pilia-Borza, didst thou meet with Ithamore?

     PILIA-BORZA. I did.

     BELLAMIRA. And didst thou deliver my letter?

     PILIA-BORZA. I did.

     BELLAMIRA. And what thinkest thou? will he come?

     PILIA-BORZA. I think so:  and yet I cannot tell; for, at the
     reading of the letter, he looked like a man of another world.

     BELLAMIRA. Why so?

     PILIA-BORZA. That such a base slave as he should be saluted by
     such a tall [146] man as I am, from such a beautiful dame as you.

     BELLAMIRA. And what said he?

     PILIA-BORZA. Not a wise word; only gave me a nod, as who should
     say, "Is it even so?" and so I left him, being driven to a
     non-plus at the critical aspect of my terrible countenance.

     BELLAMIRA. And where didst meet him?

     PILIA-BORZA. Upon mine own free-hold, within forty foot of the
     gallows, conning his neck-verse, [147] I take it, looking of [148]
     a friar's execution; whom I saluted with an old hempen proverb,
     Hodie tibi, cras mihi, and so I left him to the mercy of the
     hangman:  but, the exercise [149] being done, see where he comes.

          Enter ITHAMORE.

     ITHAMORE. I never knew a man take his death so patiently as
     this friar; he was ready to leap off ere the halter was about
     his neck; and, when the hangman had put on his hempen tippet,
     he made such haste to his prayers, as if he had had another
     cure to serve.  Well, go whither he will, I'll be none of his
     followers in haste:  and, now I think on't, going to the
     execution, a fellow met me with a muschatoes [150] like a raven's
     wing, and a dagger with a hilt like a warming-pan; and he gave
     me a letter from one Madam Bellamira, saluting me in such sort
     as if he had meant to make clean my boots with his lips; the
     effect was, that I should come to her house:  I wonder what the
     reason is; it may be she sees more in me than I can find in
     myself; for she writes further, that she loves me ever since she
     saw me; and who would not requite such love?  Here's her house;
     and here she comes; and now would I were gone!  I am not worthy
     to look upon her.

     PILIA-BORZA. This is the gentleman you writ to.

     ITHAMORE. Gentleman! he flouts me:  what gentry can be in a poor
     Turk of tenpence? [151]  I'll be gone.
          [Aside.]

     BELLAMIRA. Is't not a sweet-faced youth, Pilia?

     ITHAMORE. Again, sweet youth! [Aside.]--Did not you, sir, bring
     the sweet youth a letter?

     PILIA-BORZA. I did, sir, and from this gentlewoman, who, as
     myself and the rest of the family, stand or fall at your service.

     BELLAMIRA. Though woman's modesty should hale me back,
     I can withhold no longer:  welcome, sweet love.

     ITHAMORE. Now am I clean, or rather foully, out of the way.
          [Aside.]

     BELLAMIRA. Whither so soon?

     ITHAMORE. I'll go steal some money from my master to make me
     handsome [Aside].--Pray, pardon me; I must go see a ship
     discharged.

     BELLAMIRA. Canst thou be so unkind to leave me thus?

     PILIA-BORZA. An ye did but know how she loves you, sir!

     ITHAMORE. Nay, I care not how much she loves me.--Sweet
     Bellamira, would I had my master's wealth for thy sake!

     PILIA-BORZA. And you can have it, sir, an if you please.

     ITHAMORE. If 'twere above ground, I could, and would have it;
     but he hides and buries it up, as partridges do their eggs,
     under the earth.

     PILIA-BORZA. And is't not possible to find it out?

     ITHAMORE. By no means possible.

     BELLAMIRA. What shall we do with this base villain, then?
          [Aside to PILIA-BORZA.]

     PILIA-BORZA. Let me alone; do but you speak him fair.--
          [Aside to her.]
     But you know [152] some secrets of the Jew,
     Which, if they were reveal'd, would do him harm.

     ITHAMORE. Ay, and such as--go to, no more! I'll make him [153]
     send me half he has, and glad he scapes so too:  I'll write unto
     him; we'll have money straight.

     PILIA-BORZA. Send for a hundred crowns at least.

     ITHAMORE. Ten hundred thousand crowns.--[writing] MASTER BARABAS,--

     PILIA-BORZA. Write not so submissively, but threatening him.

     ITHAMORE. [writing] SIRRAH BARABAS, SEND ME A HUNDRED CROWNS.

     PILIA-BORZA. Put in two hundred at least.

     ITHAMORE. [writing] I CHARGE THEE SEND ME THREE HUNDRED BY THIS
     BEARER, AND THIS SHALL BE YOUR WARRANT:  IF YOU DO NOT--NO MORE,
     BUT SO.

     PILIA-BORZA. Tell him you will confess.

     ITHAMORE. [writing] OTHERWISE I'LL CONFESS ALL.--
     Vanish, and return in a twinkle.

     PILIA-BORZA. Let me alone; I'll use him in his kind.

     ITHAMORE. Hang him, Jew!
          [Exit PILIA-BORZA with the letter.]

     BELLAMIRA. Now, gentle Ithamore, lie in my lap.--
     Where are my maids? provide a cunning [154] banquet;
     Send to the merchant, bid him bring me silks;
     Shall Ithamore, my love, go in such rags?

     ITHAMORE. And bid the jeweller come hither too.

     BELLAMIRA. I have no husband; sweet, I'll marry thee.

     ITHAMORE. Content:  but we will leave this paltry land,
     And sail from hence to Greece, to lovely Greece;--
     I'll be thy Jason, thou my golden fleece;--
     Where painted carpets o'er the meads are hurl'd,
     And Bacchus' vineyards overspread the world;
     Where woods and forests go in goodly green;--
     I'll be Adonis, thou shalt be Love's Queen;--
     The meads, the orchards, and the primrose-lanes,
     Instead of sedge and reed, bear sugar-canes:
     Thou in those groves, by Dis above,
     Shalt live with me, and be my love. [155]

     BELLAMIRA. Whither will I not go with gentle Ithamore?

          Re-enter PILIA-BORZA.

     ITHAMORE. How now! hast thou the gold [?]

     PILIA-BORZA. Yes.

     ITHAMORE. But came it freely? did the cow give down her milk
     freely?

     PILIA-BORZA. At reading of the letter, he stared and stamped,
     and turned aside:  I took him by the beard, [156] and looked upon
     him thus; told him he were best to send it:  then he hugged and
     embraced me.

     ITHAMORE. Rather for fear than love.

     PILIA-BORZA. Then, like a Jew, he laughed and jeered, and told
     me he loved me for your sake, and said what a faithful servant
     you had been.

     ITHAMORE. The more villain he to keep me thus:  here's goodly
     'parel, is there not?

     PILIA-BORZA. To conclude, he gave me ten crowns.
          [Delivers the money to ITHAMORE.]

     ITHAMORE. But ten? I'll not leave him worth a grey groat.  Give
     me a ream of paper:  we'll have a kingdom of gold for't. [157]

     PILIA-BORZA. Write for five hundred crowns.

     ITHAMORE. [writing] SIRRAH JEW, AS YOU LOVE YOUR LIFE, SEND ME
     FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS, AND GIVE THE BEARER A HUNDRED.--Tell him
     I must have't.

     PILIA-BORZA. I warrant, your worship shall have't.

     ITHAMORE. And, if he ask why I demand so much, tell him I scorn
     to write a line under a hundred crowns.

     PILIA-BORZA. You'd make a rich poet, sir.  I am gone.
          [Exit with the letter.]

     ITHAMORE. Take thou the money; spend it for my sake.

     BELLAMIRA. 'Tis not thy money, but thyself I weigh:
     Thus Bellamira esteems of gold;
          [Throws it aside.]
     But thus of thee.
          [Kisses him.]

     ITHAMORE. That kiss again!--She runs division [158] of my
     lips.  What an eye she casts on me! it twinkles like a star.
          [Aside.]

     BELLAMIRA. Come, my dear love, let's in and sleep together.

     ITHAMORE. O, that ten thousand nights were put in one, that
     we might sleep seven years together afore we wake!

     BELLAMIRA. Come, amorous wag, first banquet, and then sleep.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter BARABAS, [159] reading a letter.

     BARABAS. BARABAS, SEND ME THREE HUNDRED CROWNS;--
     Plain Barabas!  O, that wicked courtezan!
     He was not wont to call me Barabas;--
     OR ELSE I WILL CONFESS;--ay, there it goes:
     But, if I get him, coupe de gorge for that.
     He sent a shaggy, tatter'd, [160] staring slave,
     That, when he speaks, draws out his grisly beard,
     And winds it twice or thrice about his ear;
     Whose face has been a grind-stone for men's swords;
     His hands are hack'd, some fingers cut quite off;
     Who, when he speaks, grunts like a hog, and looks
     Like one that is employ'd in catzery [161]
     And cross-biting; [162] such a rogue
     As is the husband to a hundred whores;
     And I by him must send three hundred crowns.
     Well, my hope is, he will not stay there still;
     And, when he comes--O, that he were but here!

          Enter PILIA-BORZA.

     PILIA-BORZA. Jew, I must ha' more gold.

     BARABAS. Why, want'st thou any of thy tale? [163]

     PILIA-BORZA. No; but three hundred will not serve his turn.

     BARABAS. Not serve his turn, sir!

     PILIA-BORZA.
     No, sir; and therefore I must have five hundred more.

     BARABAS. I'll rather----

     PILIA-BORZA. O, good words, sir, and send it you were best! see,
     there's his letter.
          [Gives letter.]

     BARABAS. Might he not as well come as send? pray, bid him come
     and fetch it:  what he writes for you, [164] ye shall have
     straight.

     PILIA-BORZA. Ay, and the rest too, or else----

     BARABAS. I must make this villain away [Aside].--Please you dine
     with me, sir--and you shall be most heartily poisoned.
          [Aside.]

     PILIA-BORZA. No, God-a-mercy.  Shall I have these crowns?

     BARABAS. I cannot do it; I have lost my keys.

     PILIA-BORZA. O, if that be all, I can pick ope your locks.

     BARABAS.
     Or climb up to my counting-house window:  you know my meaning.

     PILIA-BORZA. I know enough, and therefore talk not to me of
     your counting-house.  The gold! or know, Jew, it is in my power
     to hang thee.

     BARABAS. I am betray'd.--
          [Aside.]
     'Tis not five hundred crowns that I esteem;
     I am not mov'd at that:  this angers me,
     That he, who knows I love him as myself,
     Should write in this imperious vein.  Why, sir,
     You know I have no child, and unto whom
     Should I leave all, but unto Ithamore?

     PILIA-BORZA. Here's many words, but no crowns:  the crowns!

     BARABAS. Commend me to him, sir, most humbly,
     And unto your good mistress as unknown.

     PILIA-BORZA. Speak, shall I have 'em, sir?

     BARABAS. Sir, here they are.--
          [Gives money.]
     O, that I should part [165] with so much gold!--
          [Aside.]
     Here, take 'em, fellow, with as good a will----
     As I would see thee hang'd [Aside].  O, love stops my breath!
     Never lov'd man servant as I do Ithamore.

     PILIA-BORZA. I know it, sir.

     BARABAS. Pray, when, sir, shall I see you at my house?

     PILIA-BORZA. Soon enough to your cost, sir.  Fare you well.
          [Exit.]

     BARABAS. Nay, to thine own cost, villain, if thou com'st!
     Was ever Jew tormented as I am?
     To have a shag-rag knave to come [force from me]
     Three hundred crowns, and then five hundred crowns!
     Well; I must seek a means to rid [166] 'em all,
     And presently; for in his villany
     He will tell all he knows, and I shall die for't.
     I have it:
     I will in some disguise go see the slave,
     And how the villain revels with my gold.
          [Exit.]

          Enter BELLAMIRA, [167] ITHAMORE, and PILIA-BORZA.

     BELLAMIRA. I'll pledge thee, love, and therefore drink it off.

     ITHAMORE. Say'st thou me so? have at it! and do you hear?
          [Whispers to her.]

     BELLAMIRA. Go to, it shall be so.

     ITHAMORE. Of [168] that condition I will drink it up:
     Here's to thee.

     BELLAMIRA. [169] Nay, I'll have all or none.

     ITHAMORE. There, if thou lov'st me, do not leave a drop.

     BELLAMIRA. Love thee! fill me three glasses.

     ITHAMORE. Three and fifty dozen:  I'll pledge thee.

     PILIA-BORZA. Knavely spoke, and like a knight-at-arms.

     ITHAMORE. Hey, Rivo Castiliano! [170] a man's a man.

     BELLAMIRA. Now to the Jew.

     ITHAMORE. Ha! to the Jew; and send me money he [171] were best.

     PILIA-BORZA. What wouldst thou do, if he should send thee none?

     ITHAMORE. Do nothing:  but I know what I know; he's a murderer.

     BELLAMIRA. I had not thought he had been so brave a man.

     ITHAMORE. You knew Mathias and the governor's son; he and I
     killed 'em both, and yet never touched 'em.

     PILIA-BORZA. O, bravely done!

     ITHAMORE. I carried the broth that poisoned the nuns; and he
     and I, snicle hand too fast, strangled a friar. [172]

     BELLAMIRA. You two alone?

     ITHAMORE.
     We two; and 'twas never known, nor never shall be for me.

     PILIA-BORZA. This shall with me unto the governor.
          [Aside to BELLAMIRA.]

     BELLAMIRA. And fit it should:  but first let's ha' more gold.--
          [Aside to PILIA-BORZA.]
     Come, gentle Ithamore, lie in my lap.

     ITHAMORE. Love me little, love me long:  let music rumble,
     Whilst I in thy incony [173] lap do tumble.

          Enter BARABAS, disguised as a French musician, with a lute,
          and a nosegay in his hat.

     BELLAMIRA. A French musician!--Come, let's hear your skill.

     BARABAS. Must tuna my lute for sound, twang, twang, first.

     ITHAMORE. Wilt drink, Frenchman? here's to thee with a--Pox on
     this drunken hiccup!

     BARABAS. Gramercy, monsieur.

     BELLAMIRA. Prithee, Pilia-Borza, bid the fiddler give me the
     posy in his hat there.

     PILIA-BORZA. Sirrah, you must give my mistress your posy.

     BARABAS. A votre commandement, madame.
          [Giving nosegay.]

     BELLAMIRA. How sweet, my Ithamore, the flowers smell!

     ITHAMORE. Like thy breath, sweetheart; no violet like 'em.

     PILIA-BORZA. Foh! methinks they stink like a hollyhock. [174]

     BARABAS. So, now I am reveng'd upon 'em all:
     The scent thereof was death; I poison'd it.
          [Aside.]

     ITHAMORE.
     Play, fiddler, or I'll cut your cat's guts into chitterlings.

     BARABAS.
     Pardonnez moi, be no in tune yet:  so, now, now all be in.

     ITHAMORE. Give him a crown, and fill me out more wine.

     PILIA-BORZA. There's two crowns for thee:  play.
          [Giving money.]

     BARABAS. How liberally the villain gives me mine own gold!
          [Aside, and then plays.]

     PILIA-BORZA. Methinks he fingers very well.

     BARABAS. So did you when you stole my gold.
          [Aside.]

     PILIA-BORZA. How swift he runs!

     BARABAS. You run swifter when you threw my gold out of my window.
          [Aside.]

     BELLAMIRA. Musician, hast been in Malta long?

     BARABAS. Two, three, four month, madam.

     ITHAMORE. Dost not know a Jew, one Barabas?

     BARABAS. Very mush:  monsieur, you no be his man?

     PILIA-BORZA. His man!

     ITHAMORE. I scorn the peasant:  tell him so.

     BARABAS. He knows it already.
          [Aside.]

     ITHAMORE. 'Tis a strange thing of that Jew, he lives upon
     pickled grasshoppers and sauced mushrooms. [175]

     BARABAS. What a slave's this! the governor feeds not as I do.
          [Aside.]

     ITHAMORE. He never put on clean shirt since he was circumcised.

     BARABAS. O rascal! I change myself twice a-day.
          [Aside.]

     ITHAMORE. The hat he wears, Judas left under the elder when he
     hanged himself. [176]

     BARABAS. 'Twas sent me for a present from the Great Cham.
          [Aside.]

     PILIA-BORZA. A nasty [177] slave he is.--Whither now, fiddler?

     BARABAS. Pardonnez moi, monsieur; me [178] be no well.

     PILIA-BORZA. Farewell, fiddler [Exit BARABAS.] One letter more
     to the Jew.

     BELLAMIRA. Prithee, sweet love, one more, and write it sharp.

     ITHAMORE. No, I'll send by word of mouth now.
     --Bid him deliver thee a thousand crowns, by the same token
     that the nuns loved rice, that Friar Barnardine slept in his
     own clothes; any of 'em will do it.

     PILIA-BORZA. Let me alone to urge it, now I know the meaning.

     ITHAMORE. The meaning has a meaning.  Come, let's in:
     To undo a Jew is charity, and not sin.
          [Exeunt.]




ACT V.

          Enter FERNEZE, [179] KNIGHTS, MARTIN DEL BOSCO, and OFFICERS.

     FERNEZE. Now, gentlemen, betake you to your arms,
     And see that Malta be well fortified;
     And it behoves you to be resolute;
     For Calymath, having hover'd here so long,
     Will win the town, or die before the walls.

     FIRST KNIGHT. And die he shall; for we will never yield.

          Enter BELLAMIRA and PILIA-BORZA.

     BELLAMIRA. O, bring us to the governor!

     FERNEZE. Away with her! she is a courtezan.

     BELLAMIRA. Whate'er I am, yet, governor, hear me speak:
     I bring thee news by whom thy son was slain:
     Mathias did it not; it was the Jew.

     PILIA-BORZA. Who, besides the slaughter of these gentlemen,
     Poison'd his own daughter and the nuns,
     Strangled a friar, and I know not what
     Mischief beside.

     FERNEZE. Had we but proof of this----

     BELLAMIRA. Strong proof, my lord:  his man's now at my lodging,
     That was his agent; he'll confess it all.

     FERNEZE. Go fetch him [180] straight [Exeunt OFFICERS].
     I always fear'd that Jew.

          Re-enter OFFICERS with BARABAS and ITHAMORE.

     BARABAS. I'll go alone; dogs, do not hale me thus.

     ITHAMORE.
     Nor me neither; I cannot out-run you, constable.--O, my belly!

     BARABAS. One dram of powder more had made all sure:
     What a damn'd slave was I!
          [Aside.]

     FERNEZE. Make fires, heat irons, let the rack be fetch'd.

     FIRST KNIGHT. Nay, stay, my lord; 't may be he will confess.

     BARABAS. Confess! what mean you, lords? who should confess?

     FERNEZE. Thou and thy Turk; 'twas that slew my son.

     ITHAMORE. Guilty, my lord, I confess.  Your son and Mathias
     were both contracted unto Abigail: [he] forged a counterfeit
     challenge.

     BARABAS. Who carried that challenge?

     ITHAMORE.
     I carried it, I confess; but who writ it? marry, even he that
     strangled Barnardine, poisoned the nuns and his own daughter.

     FERNEZE. Away with him! his sight is death to me.

     BARABAS. For what, you men of Malta? hear me speak.
     She is a courtezan, and he a thief,
     And he my bondman:  let me have law;
     For none of this can prejudice my life.

     FERNEZE. Once more, away with him!--You shall have law.

     BARABAS. Devils, do your worst!--I['ll] live in spite of you.--
          [Aside.]
     As these have spoke, so be it to their souls!--
     I hope the poison'd flowers will work anon.
          [Aside.]
          [Exeunt OFFICERS with BARABAS and ITHAMORE; BELLAMIRA,
          and PILIA-BORZA.]

          Enter KATHARINE.

     KATHARINE. Was my Mathias murder'd by the Jew?
     Ferneze, 'twas thy son that murder'd him.

     FERNEZE. Be patient, gentle madam:  it was he;
     He forg'd the daring challenge made them fight.

     KATHARINE. Where is the Jew? where is that murderer?

     FERNEZE. In prison, till the law has pass'd on him.

          Re-enter FIRST OFFICER.

     FIRST OFFICER. My lord, the courtezan and her man are dead;
     So is the Turk and Barabas the Jew.

     FERNEZE. Dead!

     FIRST OFFICER. Dead, my lord, and here they bring his body.

     MARTIN DEL BOSCO. This sudden death of his is very strange.

          Re-enter OFFICERS, carrying BARABAS as dead.

     FERNEZE. Wonder not at it, sir; the heavens are just;
     Their deaths were like their lives; then think not of 'em.--
     Since they are dead, let them be buried:
     For the Jew's body, throw that o'er the walls,
     To be a prey for vultures and wild beasts.--
     So, now away and fortify the town.

          Exeunt all, leaving BARABAS on the floor. [181]

     BARABAS. [rising] What, all alone! well fare, sleepy drink!
     I'll be reveng'd on this accursed town;
     For by my means Calymath shall enter in:
     I'll help to slay their children and their wives,
     To fire the churches, pull their houses down,
     Take my goods too, and seize upon my lands.
     I hope to see the governor a slave,
     And, rowing in a galley, whipt to death.

          Enter CALYMATH, BASSOES, [182] and TURKS.

     CALYMATH. Whom have we there? a spy?

     BARABAS. Yes, my good lord, one that can spy a place
     Where you may enter, and surprize the town:
     My name is Barabas; I am a Jew.

     CALYMATH. Art thou that Jew whose goods we heard were sold
     For tribute-money?

     BARABAS. The very same, my lord:
     And since that time they have hir'd a slave, my man,
     To accuse me of a thousand villanies:
     I was imprisoned, but scap [']d their hands.

     CALYMATH. Didst break prison?

     BARABAS. No, no:
     I drank of poppy and cold mandrake juice;
     And being asleep, belike they thought me dead,
     And threw me o'er the walls:  so, or how else,
     The Jew is here, and rests at your command.

     CALYMATH. 'Twas bravely done:  but tell me, Barabas,
     Canst thou, as thou report'st, make Malta ours?

     BARABAS. Fear not, my lord; for here, against the trench, [183]
     The rock is hollow, and of purpose digg'd,
     To make a passage for the running streams
     And common channels [184] of the city.
     Now, whilst you give assault unto the walls,
     I'll lead five hundred soldiers through the vault,
     And rise with them i' the middle of the town,
     Open the gates for you to enter in;
     And by this means the city is your own.

     CALYMATH. If this be true, I'll make thee governor.

     BARABAS. And, if it be not true, then let me die.

     CALYMATH. Thou'st doom'd thyself.--Assault it presently.
          [Exeunt.]

          Alarums within.  Enter CALYMATH, [185] BASSOES, TURKS, and
          BARABAS; with FERNEZE and KNIGHTS prisoners.

     CALYMATH. Now vail [186] your pride, you captive Christians,
     And kneel for mercy to your conquering foe:
     Now where's the hope you had of haughty Spain?
     Ferneze, speak; had it not been much better
     To kept [187] thy promise than be thus surpris'd?

     FERNEZE. What should I say? we are captives, and must yield.

     CALYMATH. Ay, villains, you must yield, and under Turkish yokes
     Shall groaning bear the burden of our ire:--
     And, Barabas, as erst we promis'd thee,
     For thy desert we make thee governor;
     Use them at thy discretion.

     BARABAS. Thanks, my lord.

     FERNEZE. O fatal day, to fall into the hands
     Of such a traitor and unhallow'd Jew!
     What greater misery could heaven inflict?

     CALYMATH. 'Tis our command:--and, Barabas, we give,
     To guard thy person, these our Janizaries:
     Entreat [188] them well, as we have used thee.--
     And now, brave bassoes, [189] come; we'll walk about
     The ruin'd town, and see the wreck we made.--
     Farewell, brave Jew, farewell, great Barabas!

     BARABAS. May all good fortune follow Calymath!
          [Exeunt CALYMATH and BASSOES.]
     And now, as entrance to our safety,
     To prison with the governor and these
     Captains, his consorts and confederates.

     FERNEZE. O villain! heaven will be reveng'd on thee.

     BARABAS. Away! no more; let him not trouble me.
          [Exeunt TURKS with FERNEZE and KNIGHTS.]
     Thus hast thou gotten, [190] by thy policy,
     No simple place, no small authority:
     I now am governor of Malta; true,--
     But Malta hates me, and, in hating me,
     My life's in danger; and what boots it thee,
     Poor Barabas, to be the governor,
     Whenas [191] thy life shall be at their command?
     No, Barabas, this must be look'd into;
     And, since by wrong thou gott'st authority,
     Maintain it bravely by firm policy;
     At least, unprofitably lose it not;
     For he that liveth in authority,
     And neither gets him friends nor fills his bags,
     Lives like the ass that Aesop speaketh of,
     That labours with a load of bread and wine,
     And leaves it off to snap on thistle-tops:
     But Barabas will be more circumspect.
     Begin betimes; Occasion's bald behind:
     Slip not thine opportunity, for fear too late
     Thou seek'st for much, but canst not compass it.--
     Within here! [192]

          Enter FERNEZE, with a GUARD.

     FERNEZE. My lord?

     BARABAS. Ay, LORD; thus slaves will learn.
     Now, governor,--stand by there, wait within,--
          [Exeunt GUARD.]
     This is the reason that I sent for thee:
     Thou seest thy life and Malta's happiness
     Are at my arbitrement; and Barabas
     At his discretion may dispose of both:
     Now tell me, governor, and plainly too,
     What think'st thou shall become of it and thee?

     FERNEZE. This, Barabas; since things are in thy power,
     I see no reason but of Malta's wreck,
     Nor hope of thee but extreme cruelty:
     Nor fear I death, nor will I flatter thee.

     BARABAS. Governor, good words; be not so furious
     'Tis not thy life which can avail me aught;
     Yet you do live, and live for me you shall:
     And as for Malta's ruin, think you not
     'Twere slender policy for Barabas
     To dispossess himself of such a place?
     For sith, [193] as once you said, within this isle,
     In Malta here, that I have got my goods,
     And in this city still have had success,
     And now at length am grown your governor,
     Yourselves shall see it shall not be forgot;
     For, as a friend not known but in distress,
     I'll rear up Malta, now remediless.

     FERNEZE. Will Barabas recover Malta's loss?
     Will Barabas be good to Christians?

     BARABAS. What wilt thou give me, governor, to procure
     A dissolution of the slavish bands
     Wherein the Turk hath yok'd your land and you?
     What will you give me if I render you
     The life of Calymath, surprise his men,
     And in an out-house of the city shut
     His soldiers, till I have consum'd 'em all with fire?
     What will you give him that procureth this?

     FERNEZE. Do but bring this to pass which thou pretendest,
     Deal truly with us as thou intimatest,
     And I will send amongst the citizens,
     And by my letters privately procure
     Great sums of money for thy recompense:
     Nay, more, do this, and live thou governor still.

     BARABAS. Nay, do thou this, Ferneze, and be free:
     Governor, I enlarge thee; live with me;
     Go walk about the city, see thy friends:
     Tush, send not letters to 'em; go thyself,
     And let me see what money thou canst make:
     Here is my hand that I'll set Malta free;
     And thus we cast [194] it:  to a solemn feast
     I will invite young Selim Calymath,
     Where be thou present, only to perform
     One stratagem that I'll impart to thee,
     Wherein no danger shall betide thy life,
     And I will warrant Malta free for ever.

     FERNEZE. Here is my hand; believe me, Barabas,
     I will be there, and do as thou desirest.
     When is the time?

     BARABAS. Governor, presently;
     For Calymath, when he hath view'd the town,
     Will take his leave, and sail toward Ottoman.

     FERNEZE. Then will I, Barabas, about this coin,
     And bring it with me to thee in the evening.

     BARABAS. Do so; but fail not:  now farewell, Ferneze:--
          [Exit FERNEZE.]
     And thus far roundly goes the business:
     Thus, loving neither, will I live with both,
     Making a profit of my policy;
     And he from whom my most advantage comes,
     Shall be my friend.
     This is the life we Jews are us'd to lead;
     And reason too, for Christians do the like.
     Well, now about effecting this device;
     First, to surprise great Selim's soldiers,
     And then to make provision for the feast,
     That at one instant all things may be done:
     My policy detests prevention.
     To what event my secret purpose drives,
     I know; and they shall witness with their lives.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter CALYMATH and BASSOES. [195]

     CALYMATH. Thus have we view'd the city, seen the sack,
     And caus'd the ruins to be new-repair'd,
     Which with our bombards' shot and basilisk[s] [196]
     We rent in sunder at our entry:
     And, now I see the situation,
     And how secure this conquer'd island stands,
     Environ'd with the Mediterranean sea,
     Strong-countermin'd with other petty isles,
     And, toward Calabria, [197] back'd by Sicily
     (Where Syracusian Dionysius reign'd),
     Two lofty turrets that command the town,
     I wonder how it could be conquer'd thus.

          Enter a MESSENGER.

     MESSENGER. From Barabas, Malta's governor, I bring
     A message unto mighty Calymath:
     Hearing his sovereign was bound for sea,
     To sail to Turkey, to great Ottoman,
     He humbly would entreat your majesty
     To come and see his homely citadel,
     And banquet with him ere thou leav'st the isle.

     CALYMATH. To banquet with him in his citadel!
     I fear me, messenger, to feast my train
     Within a town of war so lately pillag'd,
     Will be too costly and too troublesome:
     Yet would I gladly visit Barabas,
     For well has Barabas deserv'd of us.

     MESSENGER. Selim, for that, thus saith the governor,--
     That he hath in [his] store a pearl so big,
     So precious, and withal so orient,
     As, be it valu'd but indifferently,
     The price thereof will serve to entertain
     Selim and all his soldiers for a month;
     Therefore he humbly would entreat your highness
     Not to depart till he has feasted you.

     CALYMATH. I cannot feast my men in Malta-walls,
     Except he place his tables in the streets.

     MESSENGER. Know, Selim, that there is a monastery
     Which standeth as an out-house to the town;
     There will he banquet them; but thee at home,
     With all thy bassoes and brave followers.

     CALYMATH. Well, tell the governor we grant his suit;
     We'll in this summer-evening feast with him.

     MESSENGER. I shall, my lord.
          [Exit.]

     CALYMATH. And now, bold bassoes, let us to our tents,
     And meditate how we may grace us best,
     To solemnize our governor's great feast.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter FERNEZE, [198] KNIGHTS, and MARTIN DEL BOSCO.

     FERNEZE. In this, my countrymen, be rul'd by me:
     Have special care that no man sally forth
     Till you shall hear a culverin discharg'd
     By him that bears the linstock, [199] kindled thus;
     Then issue out and come to rescue me,
     For happily I shall be in distress,
     Or you released of this servitude.

     FIRST KNIGHT. Rather than thus to live as Turkish thralls,
     What will we not adventure?

     FERNEZE. On, then; be gone.

     KNIGHTS. Farewell, grave governor.
          [Exeunt, on one side, KNIGHTS and MARTIN DEL BOSCO;
          on the other, FERNEZE.]

          Enter, above, [200] BARABAS, with a hammer, very busy;
          and CARPENTERS.

     BARABAS. How stand the cords? how hang these hinges? fast?
     Are all the cranes and pulleys sure?

     FIRST CARPENTER. [201] All fast.

     BARABAS. Leave nothing loose, all levell'd to my mind.
     Why, now I see that you have art, indeed:
     There, carpenters, divide that gold amongst you;
          [Giving money.]
     Go, swill in bowls of sack and muscadine;
     Down to the cellar, taste of all my wines.

     FIRST CARPENTER. We shall, my lord, and thank you.
          [Exeunt CARPENTERS.]

     BARABAS. And, if you like them, drink your fill and die;
     For, so I live, perish may all the world!
     Now, Selim Calymath, return me word
     That thou wilt come, and I am satisfied.

          Enter MESSENGER.

     Now, sirrah; what, will he come?

     MESSENGER. He will; and has commanded all his men
     To come ashore, and march through Malta-streets,
     That thou mayst feast them in thy citadel.

     BARABAS. Then now are all things as my wish would have 'em;
     There wanteth nothing but the governor's pelf;
     And see, he brings it.

          Enter FERNEZE.

                             Now, governor, the sum?

     FERNEZE. With free consent, a hundred thousand pounds.

     BARABAS. Pounds say'st thou, governor? well, since it is no more,
     I'll satisfy myself with that; nay, keep it still,
     For, if I keep not promise, trust not me:
     And, governor, now partake my policy.
     First, for his army, they are sent before,
     Enter'd the monastery, and underneath
     In several places are field-pieces pitch'd,
     Bombards, whole barrels full of gunpowder,
     That on the sudden shall dissever it,
     And batter all the stones about their ears,
     Whence none can possibly escape alive:
     Now, as for Calymath and his consorts,
     Here have I made a dainty gallery,
     The floor whereof, this cable being cut,
     Doth fall asunder, so that it doth sink
     Into a deep pit past recovery.
     Here, hold that knife; and, when thou seest he comes,
          [Throws down a knife.]
     And with his bassoes shall be blithely set,
     A warning-piece shall be shot off [202] from the tower,
     To give thee knowledge when to cut the cord,
     And fire the house.  Say, will not this be brave?

     FERNEZE. O, excellent! here, hold thee, Barabas;
     I trust thy word; take what I promis'd thee.

     BARABAS. No, governor; I'll satisfy thee first;
     Thou shalt not live in doubt of any thing.
     Stand close, for here they come.
          [FERNEZE retires.]
                                       Why, is not this
     A kingly kind of trade, to purchase towns
     By treachery, and sell 'em by deceit?
     Now tell me, worldlings, underneath the sun [203]
     If greater falsehood ever has been done?

          Enter CALYMATH and BASSOES.

     CALYMATH. Come, my companion-bassoes:  see, I pray,
     How busy Barabas is there above
     To entertain us in his gallery:
     Let us salute him.--Save thee, Barabas!

     BARABAS. Welcome, great Calymath!

     FERNEZE. How the slave jeers at him!
          [Aside.]

     BARABAS. Will't please thee, mighty Selim Calymath,
     To ascend our homely stairs?

     CALYMATH. Ay, Barabas.--
     Come, bassoes, ascend. [204]

     FERNEZE. [coming forward] Stay, Calymath;
     For I will shew thee greater courtesy
     Than Barabas would have afforded thee.

     KNIGHT. [within] Sound a charge there!
          [A charge sounded within:  FERNEZE cuts the cord; the floor
          of the gallery gives way, and BARABAS falls into a caldron
          placed in a pit.

          Enter KNIGHTS and MARTIN DEL BOSCO. [205]

     CALYMATH. How now! what means this?

     BARABAS. Help, help me, Christians, help!

     FERNEZE. See, Calymath! this was devis'd for thee.

     CALYMATH. Treason, treason! bassoes, fly!

     FERNEZE. No, Selim, do not fly:
     See his end first, and fly then if thou canst.

     BARABAS. O, help me, Selim! help me, Christians!
     Governor, why stand you all so pitiless?

     FERNEZE. Should I in pity of thy plaints or thee,
     Accursed Barabas, base Jew, relent?
     No, thus I'll see thy treachery repaid,
     But wish thou hadst behav'd thee otherwise.

     BARABAS. You will not help me, then?

     FERNEZE. No, villain, no.

     BARABAS. And, villains, know you cannot help me now.--
     Then, Barabas, breathe forth thy latest fate,
     And in the fury of thy torments strive
     To end thy life with resolution.--
     Know, governor, 'twas I that slew thy son,--
     I fram'd the challenge that did make them meet:
     Know, Calymath, I aim'd thy overthrow:
     And, had I but escap'd this stratagem,
     I would have brought confusion on you all,
     Damn'd Christian [206] dogs, and Turkish infidels!
     But now begins the extremity of heat
     To pinch me with intolerable pangs:
     Die, life! fly, soul! tongue, curse thy fill, and die!
          [Dies.]

     CALYMATH. Tell me, you Christians, what doth this portend?

     FERNEZE. This train [207] he laid to have entrapp'd thy life;
     Now, Selim, note the unhallow'd deeds of Jews;
     Thus he determin'd to have handled thee,
     But I have rather chose to save thy life.

     CALYMATH. Was this the banquet he prepar'd for us?
     Let's hence, lest further mischief be pretended. [208]

     FERNEZE. Nay, Selim, stay; for, since we have thee here,
     We will not let thee part so suddenly:
     Besides, if we should let thee go, all's one,
     For with thy galleys couldst thou not get hence,
     Without fresh men to rig and furnish them.

     CALYMATH. Tush, governor, take thou no care for that;
     My men are all aboard,
     And do attend my coming there by this.

     FERNEZE. Why, heard'st thou not the trumpet sound a charge?

     CALYMATH. Yes, what of that?

     FERNEZE. Why, then the house was fir'd,
     Blown up, and all thy soldiers massacred.

     CALYMATH. O, monstrous treason!

     FERNEZE. A Jew's courtesy;
     For he that did by treason work our fall,
     By treason hath deliver'd thee to us:
     Know, therefore, till thy father hath made good
     The ruins done to Malta and to us,
     Thou canst not part; for Malta shall be freed,
     Or Selim ne'er return to Ottoman.

     CALYMATH. Nay, rather, Christians, let me go to Turkey,
     In person there to mediate [209] your peace:
     To keep me here will naught advantage you.

     FERNEZE. Content thee, Calymath, here thou must stay,
     And live in Malta prisoner; for come all [210] the world
     To rescue thee, so will we guard us now,
     As sooner shall they drink the ocean dry,
     Than conquer Malta, or endanger us.
     So, march away; and let due praise be given
     Neither to Fate nor Fortune, but to Heaven.
          [Exeunt.]

playing the parts of Tamburlaine, the Jew of Malta, &c.--The
passage happens to be mispointed in the old ed. thus,

    "In Hero and Leander, one did gaine
     A lasting memorie:  in Tamberlaine,
     This Jew, with others many:  th' other wan," &c.

and hence Mr. Collier, in his HIST. OF ENG. DRAM. POET. iii.
114, understood the words,

    "in Tamburlaine,
     This Jew, with others many,"

as applying to Marlowe:  he afterwards, however, in his MEMOIRS
OF ALLEYN, p. 9, suspected that the punctuation of the old ed.
might be wrong,--which it doubtless is.]

[Footnote 8: him: "Perkins."  Marg. note in old ed.--"This was Richard
Perkins, one of the performers belonging to the Cock-pit theatre
in Drury-Lane.  His name is printed among those who acted in
HANNIBAL AND SCIPIO by Nabbes, THE WEDDING by Shirley, and
THE FAIR MAID OF THE WEST by Heywood.  After the play-houses
were shut up on account of the confusion arising from the civil
wars, Perkins and Sumner, who belonged to the same house, lived
together at Clerkenwell, where they died and were buried.  They
both died some years before the Restoration.  See THE DIALOGUE
ON PLAYS AND PLAYERS [Dodsley's OLD PLAYS, 1. clii., last ed.]."
REED (apud Dodsley's O. P.).  Perkins acted a prominent part in
Webster's WHITE DEVIL, when it was first brought on the stage,
--perhaps Brachiano (for Burbadge, who was celebrated in
Brachiano, does not appear to have played it originally):  in a
notice to the reader at the end of that tragedy Webster says;
"In particular I must remember the well-approved industry of my
friend Master Perkins, and confess the worth of his action did
crown both the beginning and end."  About 1622-3 Perkins belonged
to the Red Bull theatre:  about 1637 he joined the company at
Salisbury Court:  see Webster's WORKS, note, p. 51, ed. Dyce,
1857.]

[Footnote 28: Aside: Mr. Collier (apud Dodsley's O. P.), mistaking the
purport of this stage-direction (which, of course, applies only
to the words "UNTO MYSELF"), proposed an alteration of the text.]

[Footnote 29: BARABAS. Farewell, Zaareth, &c.: Old ed. "Iew. DOE SO;
Farewell Zaareth," &c.  But "Doe so" is evidently a stage-
direction which has crept into the text, and which was intended
to signify that the Jews DO "take their leaves" of Barabas:
--here the old ed. has no "EXEUNT."]

writers) to--Sometime.]

perhaps, the motion which Barabas was to make here with his hand.]

house of Barabas, which has been turned into a nunnery.]

Mr. Collier (HIST. OF ENG. DRAM. POET. iii. 136) remarks that
these lines are cited (with some variation, and from memory,
as the present play was not printed till 1633) in an epigram on
T. Deloney, in Guilpin's SKIALETHEIA OR THE SHADOWE OF TRUTH,
1598,--

    "LIKE TO THE FATALL OMINOUS RAVEN, WHICH TOLLS

in Barabas's next speech but one, "And she VOWS LOVE TO HIM," &c.]

figure of a jewel--

     'The diamond that I talk of NE'ER WAS FOIL'D'."
COLLIER (apud Dodsley's O. P.).  But see that passage, p. 155,
sec. col., and note ||. [i.e. note 70.]]

[Footnote 88: cross: i.e. piece of money (many coins being marked with a
cross on one side).]

[Footnote 89: thou: Old ed. "thee."]

[Footnote 90: resolv'd: "i.e. satisfied." GILCHRIST (apud Dodsley's
O. P.).]

[Footnote 91: Enter BELLAMIRA: She appears, we may suppose, in a veranda
or open portico of her house (that the scene is not the interior
of the house, is proved by what follows).]

[Footnote 92:     Enter MATHIAS.
MATHIAS. This is the place, &c.: The scene is some pert of the
town, as Barabas appears "ABOVE,"--in the balcony of a house.
(He stood, of course, on what was termed the upper-stage.)

Old ed. thus;

    "Enter MATHIAS.

Math. This is the place, now Abigail shall see
Whether Mathias holds her deare or no.

Math. What, dares the villain write in such base terms?

Lod. I did it, and reuenge it if thou dar'st."]

writers often omit the article in such exclamations:  compare
Shakespeare's JULIUS CAESAR, act i. sc. 3, where Casca says,

(after which words the modern editors improperly retain the
interrogation-point of the first folio).]

Barabas; but some time is supposed to have elapsed since the
preceding conference between Abigail and Friar Jacomo.]

"life" in the preceding line).]

shalt SEE how the broth that is designed for thee is made, that
no mischievous ingredients enter its composition.  The passage
is, however, obscure." STEEVENS (apud Dodsley's O. P.).--"BY THE
EYE" seems to be equivalent to--in abundance.  Compare THE CREED
of Piers Ploughman:

times as the king was manifestly in great want of money."  REED

[Footnote 136: Therefore 'tis not requisite he should live: Lest the
reader should suspect that the author wrote,

    "Therefore 'tis requisite he should not live,"

   a similar form of expression,--
    "It is not necessary I be seen."]

        And, after that," &c."]

[Footnote 138: shall be done: Here a change of scene is supposed, to the
interior of Barabas's house.]

[Footnote 139: Friar, awake: Here, most probably, Barabas drew a curtain,
and discovered the sleeping Friar.]

[Footnote 140: have: Old ed. "saue."]

[Footnote 141: What time o' night is't now, sweet Ithamore?

      ITHAMORE. Towards one: Might be adduced, among other
passages, to shew that the modern editors are right when they
print in Shakespeare's KING JOHN. act iii. sc. 3,

                          "If the midnight bell
     Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
     Sound ONE into the drowsy ear of NIGHT," &c.]

[Footnote 142: Enter FRIAR JACOMO: The scene is now before Barabas's
house,--the audience having had to SUPPOSE that the body of
Barnardine, which Ithamore had set upright, was standing
outside the door.]

[Footnote 143: proceed: Seems to be used here as equivalent to--succeed.]

[Footnote 144: on's: i.e. of his.]

[Footnote 145: Enter BELLAMIRA, &c.: The scene, as in p. 160, a veranda
or open portico of Bellamira's house.

     BELLAMIRA. Since this town was besieg'd," etc.]

[Footnote 146: tall: Which our early dramatists generally use in the
sense of--bold, brave (see note , p. 161), [i.e. note 94: is
here perhaps equivalent to--handsome. ("Tall or SEMELY." PROMPT.

    "I'le make him send me half he has, & glad he scapes so too.
     PEN AND INKE:

There can be no doubt that the words "Pen and inke" were a
direction to the property-man to have those articles on the
stage.]

(The MAIDS are supposed to hear their mistress' orders WITHIN.)]

[Footnote 155: Shalt live with me, and be my love: A line, slightly
varied, of Marlowe's well-known song.  In the preceding line,
the absurdity of "by Dis ABOVE" is, of course, intentional.]

[Footnote 157: give me a ream of paper:  we'll have a kingdom of gold
for't: A quibble.  REALM was frequently written ream;  and
frequently (as the following passages shew), even when the
former spelling was given, the L was not sounded;

    "Vpon the siluer bosome of the STREAME
     First gan faire Themis shake her amber locks,
     Whom all the Nimphs that waight on Neptunes REALME
     Attended from the hollowe of the rocks."

     How of his glorie fardest to deriue the STREAME."
          A HERINGS TAYLE, &c. 1598, Sig. D 3.

    "Learchus slew his brother for the crowne;
     So did Cambyses fearing much the DREAME;
     Antiochus, of infamous renowne,
     His brother slew, to rule alone the REALME."

[Footnote 158: runs division: "A musical term [of very common
occurrence]."  STEEVENS (apud Dodsley's O. P.).]

[Footnote 159: Enter BARABAS: The scene certainly seems to be now the
interior of Barabas's house, notwithstanding what he presently
says to Pilia-Borza (p. 171, sec. col.), "Pray, when, sir, shall
I see you at my house?"]

[Footnote 160: tatter'd: Old ed. "totter'd":  but in a passage of our
author's EDWARD THE SECOND the two earliest 4tos have "TATTER'D
robes":--and yet Reed in a note on that passage (apud Dodsley's
OLD PLAYS, where the reading of the third 4to, "tottered robes",
is followed) boldly declares that "in every writer of this
period the word was spelt TOTTERED"! The truth is, it was spelt
sometimes one way, sometimes the other.]

[Footnote 161: catzery: i.e. cheating, roguery.  It is formed from CATSO
(CAZZO, see note *, p. 166  i.e. note 127), which our early
writers used, not only as an exclamation, but as an opprobrious
term.]

[Footnote 162: cross-biting: i.e. swindling (a cant term).--Something has
dropt out here.]

[Footnote 163: tale: i.e. reckoning.]

[Footnote 164: what he writes for you: i.e. the hundred crowns to be
given to the bearer:  see p. 170, sec. col.

     p. 170, second column, this play:

     SEND ME FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS, AND GIVE THE BEARER A HUNDRED.
     --Tell him I must have't."]

a veranda or open portico of Bellamira's house:  see note *,
p. 168. [i.e. note 145.]

[Footnote 168: Of: i.e. on.]

[Footnote 169: BELLAMIRA.: Old ed. "Pil."]

[Footnote 170: Rivo Castiliano: The origin of this Bacchanalian
exclamation has not been discovered.  RIVO generally is used
alone; but, among passages parallel to that of our text, is
the following one (which has been often cited),--

    "And RYUO will he cry and CASTILE too."
          LOOKE ABOUT YOU, 1600, Sig. L. 4.

A writer in THE WESTMINSTER REVIEW, vol. xliii. 53, thinks that
it "is a misprint for RICO-CASTELLANO, meaning a Spaniard
belonging to the class of RICOS HOMBRES, and the phrase
therefore is--

    'Hey, NOBLE CASTILIAN, a man's a man!'
'I can pledge like a man and drink like a man, MY WORTHY TROJAN;'
as some of our farce-writers would say." But the frequent
occurrence of RIVO in various authors proves that it is NOT
a misprint.]

[Footnote 171: he: Old ed. "you".]

[Footnote 172: and he and I, snicle hand too fast, strangled a friar]
There is surely some corruption here.  Steevens (apud Dodsley's
O. P.) proposes to read "hand TO FIST".  Gilchrist (ibid.)
observes, "a snicle is a north-country word for a noose, and
when a person is hanged, they say he is snicled."  See too,
in V. SNICKLE, Forby's VOC. OF EAST ANGLIA, and the CRAVEN
DIALECT.--The Rev. J. Mitford proposes the following (very
violent) alteration of this passage;

    "Itha. I carried the broth that poisoned the nuns; and he
   and I--
     Pilia. Two hands snickle-fast--
     Itha. Strangled a friar."]

[Footnote 173: incony: i.e. fine, pretty, delicate.--Old ed. "incoomy."]

[Footnote 174: they stink like a hollyhock: "This flower, however, has
no offensive smell.  STEEVENS (apud Dodsley's O. P.).  Its
odour resembles that of the poppy.]

[Footnote 175: mushrooms: For this word (as, indeed, for most words) our
early writers had no fixed spelling.  Here the old ed. has
"Mushrumbs":  and in our author's EDWARD THE SECOND, the 4tos
have "mushrump."]

[Footnote 176: under the elder when he hanged himself: That Judas hanged
himself on an elder-tree, was a popular legend.  Nay, the very
tree was exhibited to the curious in Sir John Mandeville's days:
"And faste by, is zit the Tree of Eldre, that Judas henge him
self upon, for despeyt that he hadde, whan he solde and betrayed
oure Lorde."  VOIAGE AND TRAVAILE, &c. p. 112. ed. 1725.  But,
according to Pulci, Judas had recourse to a carob-tree:

    "Era di sopra a la fonte UN CARRUBBIO,
     L'ARBOR, SI DICE, OVE S'IMPICCO GIUDA," &c.
          MORGANTE MAG. C. xxv. st. 77.]

[Footnote 178: me: Old ed. "we".]

[Footnote 179: Enter Ferneze, &c.: Scene, the interior of the Council-
house.]

[Footnote 180: him: Qy. "'em"?]

[Footnote 181: Exeunt all, leaving Barabas on the floor: Here the audience
were to suppose that Barabas had been thrown over the walls, and
that the stage now represented the outside of the city.]

here--to the Citadel, the residence of Barabas as governor.]

[Footnote 191: Whenas: i.e. When.

compare THE HOGGE HATH LOST HIS PEARLE (by R. Tailor), 1614;
"What, ho! within HERE!"  Sig. E 2.]

thus:

     I wonder how it could be conquer'd thus?"]

OTHER COMMENTS:
This E-Text of _Doctor Faustus_ is taken from a volume of
_The Works of Christopher Marlowe_.  That volume also contains
an earlier version of the play, based on the text of 1604,
which is available as an E-Text.  Some of the notes to the
earlier version are applicable to, and help explain, this
version.

THE TRAGICAL HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS

FROM THE QUARTO OF 1616.

          Enter CHORUS.

     CHORUS. Not marching in the fields of Thrasymene,
     Where Mars did mate the warlike Carthagens; [1]
     Nor sporting in the dalliance of love,
     In courts of kings where state is overturn'd;
     Nor in the pomp of proud audacious deeds,
     Intends our Muse to vaunt her [2] heavenly verse:
     Only this, gentles,--we must now perform
     The form of Faustus' fortunes, good or bad:
     And now to patient judgments we appeal,
     And speak for Faustus in his infancy.
     Now is he born of parents base of stock,
     In Germany, within a town call'd Rhodes:
     At riper years, to Wittenberg he went,
     Whereas his kinsmen chiefly brought him up.
     So much he profits in divinity,
     That shortly he was grac'd with doctor's name,
     Excelling all, and sweetly can dispute
     In th' heavenly matters of theology;
     Till swoln with cunning, of [3] a self-conceit,
     His waxen wings did mount above his reach,
     And, melting, heavens conspir'd his overthrow;
     For, falling to a devilish exercise,
     And glutted now with learning's golden gifts,
     He surfeits upon [4] cursed necromancy;
     Nothing so sweet as magic is to him,
     Which he prefers before his chiefest bliss:
     And this the man that in his study sits.
          [Exit.]

          FAUSTUS discovered in his study.

     FAUSTUS. Settle thy studies, Faustus, and begin
     To sound the depth of that thou wilt profess:
     Having commenc'd, be a divine in show,
     Yet level at the end of every art,
     And live and die in Aristotle's works.
     Sweet Analytics, 'tis thou hast ravish'd me!
     Bene disserere est finis logices.
     Is, to dispute well, logic's chiefest end?
     Affords this art no greater miracle?
     Then read no more; thou hast attain'd that end:
     A greater subject fitteth Faustus' wit:
     Bid Economy farewell, and Galen come:
     Be a physician, Faustus; heap up gold,
     And be eterniz'd for some wondrous cure:
     Summum bonum medicinoe sanitas,
     The end of physic is our body's health.
     Why, Faustus, hast thou not attain'd that end?
     Are not thy bills hung up as monuments,
     Whereby whole cities have escap'd the plague,
     And thousand [5] desperate maladies been cur'd?
     Yet art thou still but Faustus, and a man.
     Couldst thou make men to live eternally,
     Or, being dead, raise them [6] to life again,
     Then this profession were to be esteem'd.
     Physic, farewell!  Where is Justinian?

          [Reads.]
     Si una eademque res legatur [7] duobus, alter rem,
     alter valorem rei, &c.

     A petty [8] case of paltry legacies!

          [Reads.]
     Exhoereditare filium non potest pater, nisi, &c. [9]

     Such is the subject of the institute,
     And universal body of the law:
     This study fits a mercenary drudge,
     Who aims at nothing but external trash;
     Too servile and illiberal for me.
     When all is done, divinity is best:
     Jerome's Bible, Faustus; view it well.

          [Reads.]
     Stipendium peccati mors est.
                                   Ha!
                                        Stipendium, &c.

     The reward of sin is death:  that's hard.

          [Reads.]
     Si peccasse negamus, fallimur, et nulla est in nobis veritas;

     If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there
     is no truth in us.  Why, then, belike we must sin, and so
     consequently die:
     Ay, we must die an everlasting death.
     What doctrine call you this, Che sera, sera,
     What will be, shall be?  Divinity, adieu!
     These metaphysics of magicians,
     And necromantic books are heavenly;
     Lines, circles, scenes, letters, and characters; [10]
     Ay, these are those that Faustus most desires.
     O, what a world of profit and delight,
     Of power, of honour, and omnipotence,
     Is promis'd to the studious artizan!
     All things that move between the quiet poles
     Shall be at my command:  emperors and kings
     Are but obeyed in their several provinces;
     But his dominion that exceeds in this,
     Stretcheth as far as doth the mind of man;
     A sound magician is a demigod:
     Here tire, my brains, to gain [11] a deity.

          Enter WAGNER.

     Wagner, commend me to my dearest friends,
     The German Valdes and Cornelius;
     Request them earnestly to visit me.

     WAGNER. I will, sir.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. Their conference will be a greater help to me
     Than all my labours, plod I ne'er so fast.

          Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.

     GOOD ANGEL. O, Faustus, lay that damned book aside,
     And gaze not on it, lest it tempt thy soul,
     And heap God's heavy wrath upon thy head!
     Read, read the Scriptures:--that is blasphemy.

     EVIL ANGEL. Go forward, Faustus, in that famous art
     Wherein all Nature's treasure is contain'd:
     Be thou on earth as Jove is in the sky,
     Lord and commander of these [12] elements.
          [Exeunt ANGELS.]

     FAUSTUS. How am I glutted with conceit of this!
     Shall I make spirits fetch me what I please,
     Resolve me of all ambiguities,
     Perform what desperate enterprise [13] I will?
     I'll have them fly to India for gold,
     Ransack the ocean for orient pearl,
     And search all corners of the new-found world
     For pleasant fruits and princely delicates;
     I'll have them read me strange philosophy,
     And tell the secrets of all foreign kings;
     I'll have them wall all Germany with brass,
     And make swift Rhine circle fair [14] Wertenberg;
     I'll have them fill the public schools with silk, [15]
     Wherewith the students shall be bravely clad;
     I'll levy soldiers with the coin they bring,
     And chase the Prince of Parma from our land,
     And reign sole king of all the provinces;
     Yea, stranger engines for the brunt of war,
     Than was the fiery keel at Antwerp-bridge,
     I'll make my servile spirits to invent.

          Enter VALDES and CORNELIUS.

     Come, German Valdes, and Cornelius,
     And make me blest [16] with your sage conference.
     Valdes, sweet Valdes, and Cornelius,
     Know that your words have won me at the last
     To practice magic and concealed arts.
     Philosophy is odious and obscure;
     Both law and physic are for petty wits:
     'Tis magic, magic that hath ravish'd me.
     Then, gentle friends, aid me in this attempt;
     And I, that have with subtle syllogisms
     Gravell'd the pastors of the German church,
     And made the flowering pride of Wittenberg
     Swarm [17] to my problems, as th' infernal spirits
     On sweet Musaeus when he came to hell,
     Will be as cunning as Agrippa was,
     Whose shadow made all Europe honour him.

     VALDES. Faustus, these books, thy wit, and our experience,
     Shall make all nations to [18] canonize us.
     As Indian Moors obey their Spanish lords,
     So shall the spirits of every element
     Be always serviceable to us three;
     Like lions shall they guard us when we please;
     Like Almain rutters with their horsemen's staves,
     Or Lapland giants, trotting by our sides;
     Sometimes like women, or unwedded maids,
     Shadowing more beauty in their airy brows
     Than have [19] the white breasts of the queen of love:
     From Venice shall they [20] drag huge [21] argosies,
     And from America the golden fleece
     That yearly stuffs [22] old Philip's treasury;
     If learned Faustus will be resolute.

     FAUSTUS. Valdes, as resolute am I in this
     As thou to live:  therefore object it not.

     CORNELIUS. The miracles that magic will perform
     Will make thee vow to study nothing else.
     He that is grounded in astrology,
     Enrich'd with tongues, well seen in minerals,
     Hath all the principles magic doth require:
     Then doubt not, Faustus, but to be renowm'd, [23]
     And more frequented for this mystery
     Than heretofore the Delphian oracle.
     The spirits tell me they can dry the sea,
     And fetch the treasure of all foreign wrecks,
     Yea, all the wealth that our forefathers hid
     Within the massy entrails of the earth:
     Then tell me, Faustus, what shall we three want?

     FAUSTUS. Nothing, Cornelius.  O, this cheers my soul!
     Come, shew me some demonstrations magical,
     That I may conjure in some bushy grove,
     And have these joys in full possession.

     VALDES. Then haste thee to some solitary grove,
     And bear wise Bacon's and Albertus' [24] works,
     The Hebrew Psalter, and New Testament;
     And whatsoever else is requisite
     We will inform thee ere our conference cease.

     CORNELIUS. Valdes, first let him know the words of art;
     And then, all other ceremonies learn'd,
     Faustus may try his cunning by himself.

     VALDES. First I'll instruct thee in the rudiments,
     And then wilt thou be perfecter than I.

     FAUSTUS. Then come and dine with me, and, after meat,
     We'll canvass every quiddity thereof;
     For, ere I sleep, I'll try what I can do:
     This night I'll conjure, though I die therefore.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter two SCHOLARS.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. I wonder what's become of Faustus, that was wont
     to make our schools ring with sic probo.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. That shall we presently know; here comes his boy.

          Enter WAGNER.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. How now, sirrah! where's thy master?

     WAGNER. God in heaven knows.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Why, dost not thou know, then?

     WAGNER. Yes, I know; but that follows not.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Go to, sirrah! leave your jesting, and tell us
     where he is.

     WAGNER. That follows not by force of argument, which you, being
     licentiates, should stand upon:  therefore acknowledge your
     error, and be attentive.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Then you will not tell us?

     WAGNER. You are deceived, for I will tell you:  yet, if you were
     not dunces, you would never ask me such a question; for is he not
     corpus naturale? and is not that mobile? then wherefore should
     you ask me such a question?  But that I am by nature phlegmatic,
     slow to wrath, and prone to lechery (to love, I would say), it
     were not for you to come within forty foot of the place of
     execution, although I do not doubt but to see you both hanged
     the next sessions.  Thus having triumphed over you, I will set
     my countenance like a precisian, and begin to speak thus:--
     Truly, my dear brethren, my master is within at dinner, with
     Valdes and Cornelius, as this wine, if it could speak, would
     inform your worships:  and so, the Lord bless you, preserve you,
     and keep you, my dear brethren!
          [Exit.]

     FIRST SCHOLAR. O Faustus!
     Then I fear that which I have long suspected,
     That thou art fall'n into that [25] damned art
     For which they two are infamous through the world.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Were he a stranger, not allied to me,
     The danger of his soul would make me mourn.
     But, come, let us go and inform the Rector:
     It may be his grave counsel may reclaim him. [26]

     FIRST SCHOLAR. I fear me nothing will reclaim him now.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Yet let us see what we can do.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter FAUSTUS. [27]

     FAUSTUS. Now that the gloomy shadow of the night,
     Longing to view Orion's drizzling look,
     Leaps from th' antartic world unto the sky,
     And dims the welkin with her [28] pitchy breath,
     Faustus, begin thine incantations,
     And try if devils will obey thy hest,
     Seeing thou hast pray'd and sacrific'd to them.
     Within this circle is Jehovah's name,
     Forward and backward anagrammatiz'd,
     Th' abbreviated names of holy saints,
     Figures of every adjunct to the heavens,
     And characters of signs and erring [29] stars,
     By which the spirits are enforc'd to rise:
     Then fear not, Faustus, to be resolute,
     And try the utmost magic can perform.
          [Thunder.]
     Sint mihi dii Acherontis propitii!  Valeat numen triplex Jehovoe!
     Ignei, aerii, aquatani spiritus, salvete!  Orientis princeps
     Belzebub, inferni ardentis monarcha, et Demogorgon, propitiamus
     vos, ut appareat et surgat Mephistophilis Dragon, quod tumeraris: [30]
     per Jehovam, Gehennam, et consecratam aquam quam nunc spargo,
     signumque crucis quod nunc facio, et per vota nostra, ipse nunc
     surgat nobis dicatus [31] Mephistophilis!

          Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     I charge thee to return, and change thy shape;
     Thou art too ugly to attend on me:
     Go, and return an old Franciscan friar;
     That holy shape becomes a devil best.
          [Exit MEPHISTOPHILIS.]

     I see there's virtue in my heavenly words.
     Who would not be proficient in this art?
     How pliant is this Mephistophilis,
     Full of obedience and humility!
     Such is the force of magic and my spells.

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS like a Franciscan friar.

     MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, what wouldst thou have me do?

     FAUSTUS. I charge thee wait upon me whilst I live,
     To do whatever Faustus shall command,
     Be it to make the moon drop from her sphere,
     Or the ocean to overwhelm the world.

     MEPHIST. I am a servant to great Lucifer,
     And may not follow thee without his leave:
     No more than he commands must we perform.

     FAUSTUS. Did not he charge thee to appear to me?

     MEPHIST. No, I came hither [32] of mine own accord.

     FAUSTUS. Did not my conjuring speeches [33] raise thee? speak!

     MEPHIST. That was the cause, but yet per accidens; [34]
     For, when we hear one rack the name of God,
     Abjure the Scriptures and his Saviour Christ,
     We fly, in hope to get his glorious soul;
     Nor will we come, unless he use such means
     Whereby he is in danger to be damn'd.
     Therefore the shortest cut for conjuring
     Is stoutly to abjure all godliness,
     And pray devoutly to the prince of hell.

     FAUSTUS. So Faustus hath
     Already done; and holds this principle,
     There is no chief but only Belzebub;
     To whom Faustus doth dedicate himself.
     This word "damnation" terrifies not me,
     For I confound hell in Elysium:
     My ghost be with the old philosophers!
     But, leaving these vain trifles of men's souls,
     Tell me what is that Lucifer thy lord?

     MEPHIST. Arch-regent and commander of all spirits.

     FAUSTUS. Was not that Lucifer an angel once?

     MEPHIST. Yes, Faustus, and most dearly lov'd of God.

     FAUSTUS. How comes it, then, that he is prince of devils?

     MEPHIST. O, by aspiring pride and insolence;
     For which God threw him from the face of heaven.

     FAUSTUS. And what are you that live with Lucifer?

     MEPHIST. Unhappy spirits that fell [35] with Lucifer,
     Conspir'd against our God with Lucifer,
     And are for ever damn'd with Lucifer.

     FAUSTUS. Where are you damn'd?

     MEPHIST. In hell.

     FAUSTUS. How comes it, then, that thou art out of hell?

     MEPHIST. Why, this is hell, nor am I out of it:
     Think'st thou that I, that saw the face of God,
     And tasted the eternal joys of heaven,
     Am not tormented with ten thousand hells,
     In being depriv'd of everlasting bliss?
     O, Faustus, leave these frivolous demands,
     Which strike [36] a terror to my fainting soul!

     FAUSTUS. What, is great Mephistophilis so passionate
     For being deprived of the joys of heaven?
     Learn thou of Faustus manly fortitude,
     And scorn those joys thou never shalt possess.
     Go bear these tidings to great Lucifer:
     Seeing Faustus hath incurr'd eternal death
     By desperate thoughts against Jove's deity,
     Say, he surrenders up to him his soul,
     So he will spare him four and twenty years,
     Letting him live in all voluptuousness;
     Having thee ever to attend on me,
     To give me whatsoever I shall ask,
     To tell me whatsoever I demand,
     To slay mine enemies, and to aid my friends,
     And always be obedient to my will.
     Go, and return to mighty Lucifer,
     And meet me in my study at midnight,
     And then resolve me of thy master's mind.

     MEPHIST. I will, Faustus.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. Had I as many souls as there be stars,
     I'd give them all for Mephistophilis.
     By him I'll be great emperor of the world,
     And make a bridge thorough [37] the moving air,
     To pass the ocean with a band of men;
     I'll join the hills that bind the Afric shore,
     And make that country continent to Spain,
     And both contributary to my crown:
     The Emperor shall not live but by my leave,
     Nor any potentate of Germany.
     Now that I have obtain'd what I desir'd,
     I'll live in speculation of this art,
     Till Mephistophilis return again.
          [Exit.]

          Enter WAGNER and CLOWN.

     WAGNER. Come hither, sirrah boy.

     CLOWN. Boy!  O, disgrace to my person! zounds, boy in your face!
     You have seen many boys with beards, I am sure.

     WAGNER. Sirrah, [38] hast thou no comings in?

     CLOWN. Yes, and goings out too, you may see, sir.

     WAGNER. Alas, poor slave! see how poverty jests in his nakedness!
     I know the villain's out of service, and so hungry, that I know
     he would give his soul to the devil for a shoulder of mutton,
     though it were blood-raw.

     CLOWN. Not so neither:  I had need to have it well roasted, and
     good sauce to it, if I pay so dear, I can tell you.

     WAGNER. Sirrah, wilt thou be my man, and wait on me, and I will
     make thee go like Qui mihi discipulus?

     CLOWN. What, in verse?

     WAGNER. No, slave; in beaten silk and staves-acre.

     CLOWN. Staves-acre! that's good to kill vermin:  then, belike,
     if I serve you, I shall be lousy.

     WAGNER. Why, so thou shalt be, whether thou dost it or no; for,
     sirrah, if thou dost not presently bind thyself to me for seven
     years, I'll turn all the lice about thee into familiars, and make
     them tear thee in pieces.

     CLOWN. Nay, sir, you may save [39] yourself a labour, for they
     are as familiar with me as if they paid for their meat and drink,
     I can tell you.

     WAGNER. Well, sirrah, leave your jesting, and take these guilders.
          [Gives money.]

     CLOWN. Yes, marry, sir; and I thank you too.

     WAGNER. So, now thou art to be at an hour's warning, whensoever
     and wheresoever the devil shall fetch thee.

     CLOWN. Here, take your guilders again; [40] I'll none of 'em.

     WAGNER. Not I; thou art pressed:  prepare thyself, or [41] I will
     presently raise up two devils to carry thee away.--Banio!  Belcher!

     CLOWN. Belcher! an Belcher come here, I'll belch him:  I am not
     afraid of a devil.

          Enter two DEVILS.

     WAGNER. How now, sir! will you serve me now?

     CLOWN. Ay, good Wagner; take away the devil[s], then.

     WAGNER. Spirits, away!
          [Exeunt DEVILS.]
     Now, sirrah, follow me.

     CLOWN. I will, sir:  but hark you, master; will you teach me this
     conjuring occupation?

     WAGNER. Ay, sirrah, I'll teach thee to turn thyself to a dog,
     or a cat, or a mouse, or a rat, or any thing.

     CLOWN. A dog, or a cat, or a mouse, or a rat!
     O, brave, Wagner!

     WAGNER. Villain, call me Master Wagner, and see that you walk
     attentively, and let your right eye be always diametrally fixed
     upon my left heel, that thou mayst quasi vestigiis nostris [42]
     insistere.

     CLOWN. Well, sir, I warrant you.
          [Exeunt.]

          FAUSTUS discovered in his study.

     FAUSTUS. Now, Faustus,
     Must thou needs be damn'd, canst thou not be sav'd.
     What boots it, then, to think on God or heaven?
     Away with such vain fancies, and despair;
     Despair in God, and trust in Belzebub:
     Now, go not backward, [43] Faustus; be resolute:
     Why [44] waver'st thou?  O, something soundeth in mine ear,
     "Abjure this magic, turn to God again!"
     Why, he loves thee not;
     The god thou serv'st is thine own appetite,
     Wherein is fix'd the love of Belzebub:
     To him I'll build an altar and a church,
     And offer lukewarm blood of new-born babes.

          Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.

     EVIL ANGEL. Go forward, Faustus, in that famous [45] art.

     GOOD ANGEL. Sweet Faustus, leave that execrable art.

     FAUSTUS. Contrition, prayer, repentance--what of [46] these?

     GOOD ANGEL. O, they are means to bring thee unto heaven!

     EVIL ANGEL. Rather illusions, fruits of lunacy,
     That make men [47] foolish that do use them most.

     GOOD ANGEL. Sweet Faustus, think of heaven and heavenly things.

     EVIL ANGEL. No, Faustus; think of honour and of wealth.
          [Exeunt ANGELS.]

     FAUSTUS. Wealth!
     Why, the signiory of Embden shall be mine.
     When Mephistophilis shall stand by me,
     What power can hurt me?  Faustus, thou art safe:
     Cast no more doubts.--Mephistophilis, come,
     And bring glad tidings from great Lucifer;--
     Is't not midnight?--come Mephistophilis,
     And bring glad tidings from great Lucifer;--
     Is't not midnight?--come Mephistophilis,
     Veni, veni, Mephistophile! [48]

          Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     Now tell me what saith Lucifer, thy lord?

     MEPHIST. That I shall wait on Faustus whilst he lives,
     So he will buy my service with his soul.

     FAUSTUS. Already Faustus hath hazarded that for thee.

     MEPHIST. But now thou must bequeath it solemnly,
     And write a deed of gift with thine own blood;
     For that security craves Lucifer.
     If thou deny it, I must back to hell.

     FAUSTUS. Stay, Mephistophilis, and tell me, what good will my
     soul do thy lord?

     MEPHIST. Enlarge his kingdom.

     FAUSTUS. Is that the reason why he tempts us thus?

     MEPHIST. Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris.

     FAUSTUS. Why, have you any pain that torture others?

     MEPHIST. As great as have the human souls of men.
     But, tell me, Faustus, shall I have thy soul?
     And I will be thy slave, and wait on thee,
     And give thee more than thou hast wit to ask.

     FAUSTUS. Ay, Mephistophilis, I'll give it thee. [49]

     MEPHIST. Then, Faustus, stab thine [50] arm courageously,
     And bind thy soul, that at some certain day
     Great Lucifer may claim it as his own;
     And [51] then be thou as great as Lucifer.

     FAUSTUS. [Stabbing his arm] Lo, Mephistophilis, for love of thee,
     Faustus hath cut his arm, and with his proper blood
     Assures his soul to be great Lucifer's,
     Chief lord and regent of perpetual night!
     View here this blood that trickles from mine arm,
     And let it be propitious for my [52] wish.

     MEPHIST. But, Faustus,
     Write it in manner of a deed of gift.

     FAUSTUS. [Writing] Ay, so I do.  But, Mephistophilis,
     My blood congeals, and I can write no more.

     MEPHIST. I'll fetch thee fire to dissolve it straight.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. What might the staying of my blood portend?
     Is it [53] unwilling I should write this bill?
     Why streams it not, that I may write afresh?
     FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL:  O, there it stay'd!
     Why shouldst thou not? is not thy soul thine own?
     Then write again, FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL. [54]

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with the chafer of fire.

     MEPHIST. See, Faustus, here is fire; set it on.

     FAUSTUS. So, now the blood begins to clear again;
     Now will I make an [55] end immediately.
          [Writes.]

     MEPHIST. What will not I do to obtain his soul?
          [Aside.]

     FAUSTUS. Consummatum est; this bill is ended,
     And Faustus hath bequeath'd his soul to Lucifer.
     But what is this inscription on mine arm?
     Homo, fuge:  whither should [56] I fly?
     If unto God, [57] he'll throw me down to hell.
     My senses are deceiv'd; here's nothing writ:--
     O, yes, I see it plain; even here is writ,
     Homo, fuge:  yet shall not Faustus fly.

     MEPHIST. I'll fetch him somewhat to delight his mind.
          [Aside, and then exit.]

          Enter DEVILS, giving crowns and rich apparel to FAUSTUS.
          They dance, and then depart.

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     FAUSTUS. What means this show? speak, Mephistophilis.

     MEPHIST. Nothing, Faustus, but to delight thy mind,
     And let thee see what magic can perform.

     FAUSTUS. But may I raise such spirits when I please?

     MEPHIST. Ay, Faustus, and do greater things than these.

     FAUSTUS. Then, Mephistophilis, receive this scroll, [58]
     A deed of gift of body and of soul:
     But yet conditionally that thou perform
     All covenants and articles between us both!

     MEPHIST. Faustus, I swear by hell and Lucifer
     To effect all promises between us both!

     FAUSTUS. Then hear me read it, Mephistophilis.
          [Reads.]
     ON THESE CONDITIONS FOLLOWING.  FIRST, THAT FAUSTUS MAY BE A
     SPIRIT IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE.  SECONDLY, THAT MEPHISTOPHILIS
     SHALL BE HIS SERVANT, AND BE BY HIM COMMANDED.  THIRDLY, THAT
     MEPHISTOPHILIS SHALL DO FOR HIM, AND BRING HIM WHATSOEVER HE
     DESIRES. [59]  FOURTHLY, THAT HE SHALL BE IN HIS CHAMBER OR HOUSE
     INVISIBLE.  LASTLY, THAT HE SHALL APPEAR TO THE SAID JOHN FAUSTUS,
     AT ALL TIMES, IN WHAT SHAPE AND FORM SOEVER HE PLEASE.  I, JOHN
     FAUSTUS, OF WITTENBERG, DOCTOR, BY THESE PRESENTS, DO GIVE BOTH
     BODY AND SOUL TO LUCIFER PRINCE OF THE EAST, AND HIS MINISTER
     MEPHISTOPHILIS; AND FURTHERMORE GRANT UNTO THEM, THAT, FOUR-AND-
     TWENTY YEARS BEING EXPIRED, AND THESE ARTICLES ABOVE-WRITTEN
     BEING INVIOLATE, FULL POWER TO FETCH OR CARRY THE SAID JOHN FAUSTUS,
     BODY AND SOUL, FLESH AND [60] BLOOD, INTO THEIR HABITATION WHERESOEVER.
     BY ME, JOHN FAUSTUS.

     MEPHIST. Speak, Faustus, do you deliver this as your deed?

     FAUSTUS. Ay, take it, and the devil give thee good of it!

     MEPHIST. So, now, Faustus, ask me what thou wilt.

     FAUSTUS. First I will question with [61] thee about hell.
     Tell me, where is the [62] place that men call hell?

     MEPHIST. Under the heavens.

     FAUSTUS. Ay, so are all things else; but whereabouts?

     MEPHIST. Within the bowels of these elements,
     Where we are tortur'd and remain for ever:
     Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscrib'd
     In one self-place; but where we are is hell,
     And where hell is, there must we ever be:
     And, to be short, when all the world dissolves,
     And every creature shall be purified,
     All places shall be hell that are [63] not heaven.

     FAUSTUS. I think hell's a fable. [64]

     MEPHIST. Ay, think so still, till experience change thy mind.

     FAUSTUS. Why, dost thou think that Faustus shall be damn'd?

     MEPHIST. Ay, of necessity, for here's the scroll
     In which thou hast given thy soul to Lucifer.

     FAUSTUS. Ay, and body too; and what of that?
     Think'st thou that Faustus is so fond to imagine
     That, after this life, there is any pain?
     No, these are trifles and mere old wives' tales.

     MEPHIST. But I am an instance to prove the contrary,
     For I tell thee I am damn'd and now in hell.

     FAUSTUS. Nay, an this be hell, I'll willingly be damn'd:
     What! sleeping, eating, walking, and disputing!
     But, leaving this, let me have a wife,
     The fairest maid in Germany;
     For I am wanton and lascivious,
     And cannot live without a wife.

     MEPHIST. Well, Faustus, thou shalt have a wife.

          [MEPHISTOPHILIS fetches in a WOMAN-DEVIL.]

     FAUSTUS. What sight is this?

     MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, wilt thou have a wife?

     FAUSTUS. Here's a hot whore, indeed:  no, I'll no wife.

     MEPHIST. Marriage is but a ceremonial toy,
     And, if thou lov'st me, think no more of it.
     I'll cull thee out the fairest courtezans,
     And bring them every morning to thy bed:
     She whom thine [65] eye shall like, thy [66] heart shall have,
     Were she as chaste as was [67] Penelope,
     As wise as Saba, or as beautiful
     As was bright Lucifer before his fall.
     Here, take this book, peruse it well:
     The iterating of these lines brings gold;
     The framing of this circle on the ground
     Brings thunder, whirlwinds, storm, and lightning;
     Pronounce this thrice devoutly to thyself,
     And men in harness [68] shall appear to thee,
     Ready to execute what thou command'st.

     FAUSTUS. Thanks, Mephistophilis, for this sweet book:
     This will I keep as chary as my life.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter FAUSTUS, in his study, and MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     FAUSTUS. When I behold the heavens, [69] then I repent,
     And curse thee, wicked Mephistophilis,
     Because thou hast depriv'd me of those joys.

     MEPHIST. 'Twas thine [70] own seeking, Faustus; thank thyself.
     But, think'st thou heaven is [71] such a glorious thing?
     I tell thee, Faustus, it is not half so fair
     As thou, or any man that breathes [72] on earth.

     FAUSTUS. How prov'st thou that?

     MEPHIST. 'Twas made for man; then he's more excellent.

     FAUSTUS. If heaven was made for man, 'twas made for me:
     I will renounce this magic and repent.

          Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.

     GOOD ANGEL. Faustus, repent; yet God will pity thee.

     EVIL ANGEL. Thou art a spirit; God cannot pity thee.

     FAUSTUS. Who buzzeth in mine ears [73] I am a spirit?
     Be I a devil, yet God may pity me;
     Yea, God will pity me, if I repent.

     EVIL ANGEL. Ay, but Faustus never shall repent.
          [Exeunt ANGELS.]

     FAUSTUS. My heart is harden'd, I cannot repent;
     Scarce can I name salvation, faith, or heaven:
     Swords, poisons, halters, and envenom'd steel
     Are laid before me to despatch myself;
     And long ere this I [74] should have done the deed,
     Had not sweet pleasure conquer'd deep despair.
     Have not I made blind Homer sing to me
     Of Alexander's love and Oenon's death?
     And hath not he, that built the walls of Thebes
     With ravishing sound of his melodious harp,
     Made music with my Mephistophilis?
     Why should I die, then, or basely despair?
     I am resolv'd; Faustus shall not repent.--
     Come, Mephistophilis, let us dispute again,
     And reason of divine astrology.
     Speak, are there many spheres above the moon?
     Are all celestial bodies but one globe,
     As is the substance of this centric earth?

     MEPHIST. As are the elements, such are the heavens,
     Even from the moon unto th' empyreal orb,
     Mutually folded in each other's spheres,
     And jointly move upon one axletree,
     Whose termine [75] is term'd the world's wide pole;
     Nor are the names of Saturn, Mars, or Jupiter
     Feign'd, but are erring [76] stars.

     FAUSTUS. But have they all one motion, both situ et tempore?

     MEPHIST. All move from east to west in four-and-twenty
     hours upon the poles of the world; but differ in their motions
     upon the poles of the zodiac.

     FAUSTUS. These slender questions Wagner can decide:
     Hath Mephistophilis no greater skill?
     Who knows not the double motion [77] of the planets?
     That the first is finish'd in a natural day;
     The second thus; Saturn in thirty years; Jupiter in twelve;
     Mars in four; the Sun, Venus, and Mercury in a year; the Moon
     in twenty-eight days.  These are freshmen's questions.  But
     tell me, hath every sphere a dominion or intelligentia?

     MEPHIST. Ay.

     FAUSTUS. How many heavens or spheres are there?

     MEPHIST. Nine; the seven planets, the firmament, and the empyreal
     heaven.

     FAUSTUS. But is there not coelum igneum et crystallinum?

     MEPHIST. No, Faustus, they be but fables.

     FAUSTUS. Resolve me, then, in this one question; why are not
     conjunctions, oppositions, aspects, eclipses, all at one time,
     but in some years we have more, in some less?

     MEPHIST. Per inoequalem motum respectu totius.

     FAUSTUS. Well, I am answered.  Now tell me who made the world?

     MEPHIST. I will not.

     FAUSTUS. Sweet Mephistophilis, tell me.

     MEPHIST. Move me not, Faustus.

     FAUSTUS. Villain, have I not bound thee to tell me any thing?

     MEPHIST. Ay, [78] that is not against our kingdom; this is.
     Thou art damned; think thou of hell.

     FAUSTUS. Think, Faustus, upon God that made the world.

     MEPHIST. Remember this.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. Ay, go, accursed spirit, to ugly hell!
     'Tis thou hast damn'd distressed Faustus' soul.
     Is't not too late?

          Re-enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.

     EVIL ANGEL. Too late.

     GOOD ANGEL. Never too late, if Faustus will repent.

     EVIL ANGEL. If thou repent, devils will tear thee in pieces.

     GOOD ANGEL. Repent, and they shall never raze thy skin.
          [Exeunt ANGELS.]

     FAUSTUS. O Christ, my Saviour, my Saviour
     Help to save distressed Faustus' soul!

          Enter LUCIFER, BELZEBUB, and MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     LUCIFER. Christ cannot save thy soul, for he is just:
     There's none but I have interest in the same.

     FAUSTUS. O, what art thou that look'st so terribly?

     LUCIFER. I am Lucifer,
     And this is my companion-prince in hell.

     FAUSTUS. O Faustus, they are come to fetch thy soul!

     BELZEBUB. We are come to tell thee thou dost injure us.

     LUCIFER. Thou call'st of Christ, contrary to thy promise.

     BELZEBUB. Thou shouldst not think on God.

     LUCIFER. Think of the devil.

     BELZEBUB. And his dam too.

     FAUSTUS. Nor will Faustus henceforth:  pardon him for this,
     And Faustus vows never to look to heaven.

     LUCIFER. So shalt thou shew thyself an obedient servant,
     And we will highly gratify thee for it.

     BELZEBUB. Faustus, we are come from hell in person to shew thee
     some pastime:  sit down, and thou shalt behold the Seven Deadly
     Sins appear to thee in their own proper shapes and likeness.

     FAUSTUS. That sight will be as pleasant unto me,
     As Paradise was to Adam the first day
     Of his creation.

     LUCIFER. Talk not of Paradise or creation; but mark the show.--
     Go, Mephistophilis, and [79] fetch them in.

          MEPHISTOPHILIS brings in the SEVEN DEADLY SINS.

     BELZEBUB. Now, Faustus, question them of their names and
     dispositions.

     FAUSTUS. That shall I soon.--What art thou, the [80] first?

     PRIDE. I am Pride.  I disdain to have any parents.  I am like to
     Ovid's flea; I can creep into every corner of a wench; sometimes,
     like a perriwig, I sit upon her brow; next, like a necklace, I hang
     about her neck; then, like a fan of feathers, I kiss her lips; [81]
     and then, turning myself to a wrought smock, do what I list.
     But, fie, what a smell is here!  I'll not speak a word more for
     a king's ransom, unless the ground be perfumed, and covered with
     cloth of arras.

     FAUSTUS. Thou art a proud knave, indeed.--What art thou, the second?

     COVETOUSNESS. I am Covetousness, begotten of an old churl, in a
     leather bag:  and, might I now obtain my wish, this house, you,
     and all, should turn to gold, that I might lock you safe into
     my chest:  O my sweet gold!

     FAUSTUS. And what art thou, the third?

     ENVY. I am Envy, begotten of a chimney-sweeper and an oyster-wife.
     I cannot read, and therefore wish all books burned.  I am lean
     with seeing others eat.  O, that there would come a famine over
     all the world, that all might die, and I live alone! then thou
     shouldst see how fat I'd be.  But must thou sit, and I stand?
     come down, with a vengeance!

     FAUSTUS. Out, envious wretch!--But what art thou, the fourth?

     WRATH. I am Wrath.  I had neither father nor mother:  I leapt
     out of a lion's mouth when I was scarce an hour old; and ever
     since have run [82] up and down the world with this [83] case of
     rapiers, wounding myself when I could get none to fight withal.
     I was born in hell; and look to it, for some of you shall be my
     father.

     FAUSTUS. And what art thou, the fifth?

     GLUTTONY. I am Gluttony.  My parents are all dead, and the devil
     a penny they have left me, but a small pension, and that buys me
     thirty meals a-day and ten bevers,--a small trifle to suffice
     nature.  I come [84] of a royal pedigree:  my father was a Gammon
     of Bacon, my mother was a Hogshead of Claret-wine; my godfathers
     were these, Peter Pickled-herring and Martin Martlemas-beef; but
     my godmother, O, she was an ancient gentlewoman; her name was
     Margery March-beer.  Now, Faustus, thou hast heard all my progeny;
     wilt thou bid me to supper?

     FAUSTUS. Not I.

     GLUTTONY. Then the devil choke thee!

     FAUSTUS. Choke thyself, glutton!--What art thou, the sixth?

     SLOTH. Heigho!  I am Sloth.  I was begotten on a sunny bank.
     Heigho!  I'll not speak a word more for a king's ransom.

     FAUSTUS. And what are you, Mistress Minx, the seventh and last?

     LECHERY. Who, I, [85] sir?  I am one that loves an inch of raw
     mutton better than an ell of fried stock-fish; and the first
     letter of my name begins with L. [86]

     LUCIFER. Away to hell, away!  On, piper!
          [Exeunt the SINS.]

     FAUSTUS. O, how this sight doth delight my soul!

     LUCIFER. Tut, [87] Faustus, in hell is all manner of delight.

     FAUSTUS. O, might I see hell, and return again safe,
     How happy were I then!

     LUCIFER. Faustus, thou shalt; at midnight I will send for thee.
     Meanwhile peruse this book and view it throughly,
     And thou shalt turn thyself into what shape thou wilt.

     FAUSTUS. Thanks, mighty Lucifer!
     This will I keep as chary as my life.

     LUCIFER. Now, Faustus, farewell.

     FAUSTUS. Farewell, great Lucifer.
          [Exeunt LUCIFER and BELZEBUB.]

     Come, Mephistophilis.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter ROBIN, [88] with a book.

     ROBIN. What, Dick! look to the horses there, till I come again.
     I have gotten one of Doctor Faustus' conjuring-books; and now
     we'll have such knavery as't passes.

          Enter DICK.

     DICK. What, Robin! you must come away and walk the horses.

     ROBIN. I walk the horses!  I scorn't, faith: [89]  I have other
     matters in hand:  let the horses walk themselves, an they will.--
          [Reads.]
     A per se, a; t, h, e, the; o per se, o; Demy orgon gorgon.--
     Keep further from me, O thou illiterate and unlearned hostler!

     DICK. 'Snails, what hast thou got there? a book! why, thou canst
     not tell [90] ne'er a word on't.

     ROBIN. That thou shalt see presently:  keep out of the circle,
     I say, lest I send you into the ostry with a vengeance.

     DICK. That's like, faith! you had best leave your foolery; for,
     an my master come, he'll conjure you, faith.

     ROBIN. My master conjure me!  I'll tell thee what; an my master
     come here, I'll clap as fair a [91] pair of horns on's head as
     e'er thou sawest in thy life.

     DICK. Thou need'st [92] not do that, for my mistress hath done it.

     ROBIN. Ay, there be of us here that have waded as deep into
     matters as other men, if they were disposed to talk.

     DICK. A plague take you!  I thought you did not sneak up and down
     after her for nothing.  But, I prithee, tell me in good sadness,
     Robin, is that a conjuring-book?

     ROBIN. Do but speak what thou'lt have me to do, and I'll do't:
     if thou'lt dance naked, put off thy clothes, and I'll conjure
     thee about presently; or, if thou'lt go but to the tavern with
     me, I'll give thee white wine, red wine, claret-wine, sack,
     muscadine, malmsey, and whippincrust, hold, belly, hold; [93] and
     we'll not pay one penny for it.

     DICK. O, brave!  Prithee, [94] let's to it presently, for I am as
     dry as a dog.

     ROBIN. Come, then, let's away.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter CHORUS.

     CHORUS. Learned Faustus,
     To find the secrets of astronomy
     Graven in the book of Jove's high firmament,
     Did mount him [95] up to scale Olympus' top;
     Where, sitting in a chariot burning bright,
     Drawn by the strength of yoked dragons' necks,
     He views [96] the clouds, the planets, and the stars,
     The tropic zones, and quarters of the sky,
     From the bright circle of the horned moon
     Even to the height of Primum Mobile;
     And, whirling round with this [97] circumference,
     Within the concave compass of the pole,
     From east to west his dragons swiftly glide,
     And in eight days did bring him home again.
     Not long he stay'd within his quiet house,
     To rest his bones after his weary toil;
     But new exploits do hale him out again:
     And, mounted then upon a dragon's back,
     That with his wings did part the subtle air,
     He now is gone to prove cosmography,
     That measures coasts and kingdoms of the earth;
     And, as I guess, will first arrive at Rome,
     To see the Pope and manner of his court,
     And take some part of holy Peter's feast,
     The which this day is highly solemniz'd.
          [Exit.]

          Enter FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     FAUSTUS. Having now, my good Mephistophilis,
     Pass'd with delight the stately town of Trier,
     Environ'd round [98] with airy mountain-tops,
     With walls of flint, and deep-entrenched lakes,
     Not to be won by any conquering prince;
     From Paris next, coasting the realm of France,
     We saw the river Maine fall into Rhine, [99]
     Whose banks are set with groves of fruitful vines;
     Then up to [100] Naples, rich Campania,
     Whose buildings fair and gorgeous to the eye,
     The streets straight forth, and pav'd with finest brick,
     Quarter the town in four equivalents: [101]
     There saw we learned Maro's golden tomb;
     The way he cut, an English mile in length,
     Thorough [102] a rock of stone, in one night's space;
     From thence to Venice, Padua, and the rest, [103]
     In one of which a sumptuous temple stands,
     That threats the stars with her aspiring top,
     Whose frame is pav'd with sundry-colour'd stones,
     And roof'd aloft with curious work in gold.
     Thus hitherto hath Faustus spent his time:
     But tell me [104] now, what resting-place is this?
     Hast thou, as erst I did command,
     Conducted me within the walls of Rome?

     MEPHIST. I have, my Faustus; and, for proof thereof,
     This is the goodly palace of the Pope;
     And, 'cause we are no common guests,
     I choose his privy-chamber for our use.

     FAUSTUS. I hope his Holiness will bid us [105] welcome.

     MEPHIST. All's one, for we'll be bold with his venison.
     But now, my Faustus, that thou mayst perceive
     What Rome contains for to delight thine eyes,
     Know that this city stands upon seven hills
     That underprop the groundwork of the same:
     Just through [106] the midst runs flowing Tiber's stream,
     With winding banks that cut it in two parts;
     Over the which two stately bridges lean,
     That make safe passage to each part of Rome:
     Upon the bridge call'd Ponte [107] Angelo
     Erected is a castle passing strong,
     Where thou shalt see such store of ordnance,
     As that the double cannons, forg'd of brass,
     Do match [108] the number of the days contain'd
     Within the compass of one complete year;
     Beside the gates, and high pyramides,
     That Julius Caesar brought from Africa.

     FAUSTUS. Now, by the kingdoms of infernal rule,
     Of Styx, of Acheron, and the fiery lake
     Of ever-burning Phlegethon, I swear
     That I do long to see the [109] monuments
     And situation of bright-splendent Rome:
     Come, therefore, let's away.

     MEPHIST. Nay, stay, my Faustus:  I know you'd see the Pope,
     And take some part of holy Peter's feast,
     The which, in state and [110] high solemnity,
     This day, is held through Rome and Italy,
     In honour of the Pope's triumphant victory.

     FAUSTUS. Sweet Mephistophilis, thou pleasest me.
     Whilst I am here on earth, let me be cloy'd
     With all things that delight the heart of man:
     My four-and-twenty years of liberty
     I'll spend in pleasure and in dalliance,
     That Faustus' name, whilst [111] this bright frame doth stand,
     May be admir'd thorough [112] the furthest land.

     MEPHIST. 'Tis well said, Faustus.  Come, then, stand by me,
     And thou shalt see them come immediately.

     FAUSTUS. Nay, stay, my gentle Mephistophilis,
     And grant me my [113] request, and then I go.
     Thou know'st, within the compass of eight days
     We view'd the face of heaven, of earth, and hell;
     So high our dragons soar'd into the air,
     That, looking down, the earth appear'd to me
     No bigger than my hand in quantity;
     There did we view the kingdoms of the world,
     And what might please mine eye I there beheld.
     Then in this show let me an actor be,
     That this proud Pope may Faustus' cunning [114] see.

     MEPHIST. Let it be so, my Faustus.  But, first, stay,
     And view their triumphs as they pass this way;
     And then devise what best contents thy mind,
     By cunning in thine art to cross the Pope,
     Or dash the pride of this [115] solemnity;
     To make his monks and abbots stand like apes,
     And point like antics at [116] his triple crown;
     To beat the beads about the friars' pates,
     Or clap huge horns upon the Cardinals' heads;
     Or any villany thou canst devise;
     And I'll perform it, [117] Faustus.  Hark! they come:
     This day shall make thee be admir'd in Rome.

          Enter the CARDINALS and BISHOPS, some bearing crosiers, some
          the pillars; MONKS and FRIARS, singing their procession;
          then the POPE, RAYMOND king of Hungary, the ARCHBISHOP
          OF RHEIMS, BRUNO led in chains, and ATTENDANTS.

     POPE. Cast down our footstool.

     RAYMOND. Saxon Bruno, stoop,
     Whilst on thy back his Holiness ascends
     Saint Peter's chair and state pontifical.

     BRUNO. Proud Lucifer, that state belongs to me;
     But thus I fall to Peter, not to thee.

     POPE. To me and Peter shalt thou grovelling lie,
     And crouch before the Papal dignity.--
     Sound trumpets, then; for thus Saint Peter's heir,
     From Bruno's back, ascends Saint Peter's chair.
          [A flourish while he ascends.]
     Thus, as the gods creep on with feet of wool,
     Long ere with iron hands they punish men,
     So shall our sleeping vengeance now arise,
     And smite with death thy hated enterprise. [118]--
     Lord Cardinals of France and Padua,
     Go forthwith to our [119] holy consistory,
     And read, amongst the statutes decretal,
     What, by the holy council held at Trent,
     The sacred synod hath decreed for him
     That doth assume the Papal government
     Without election and a true consent:
     Away, and bring us word with speed.

     CARDINAL OF FRANCE. We go, my lord.
          [Exeunt CARDINALS of France and Padua.]

     POPE. Lord Raymond.
          [They converse in dumb show.]

     FAUSTUS. Go, haste thee, gentle Mephistophilis,
     Follow the cardinals to the consistory;
     And, as they turn their superstitious books,
     Strike them with sloth and drowsy idleness,
     And make them sleep so sound, that in their shapes
     Thyself and I may parley with this [120] Pope,
     This proud confronter of the Emperor;
     And, in despite of all his holiness,
     Restore this Bruno to his liberty,
     And bear him to the states of Germany.

     MEPHIST. Faustus, I go.

     FAUSTUS. Despatch it soon:
     The Pope shall curse, that Faustus came to Rome.
          [Exeunt FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS.]

     BRUNO. Pope Adrian, let me have right [121] of law:
     I was elected by the Emperor.

     POPE. We will depose the Emperor for that deed,
     And curse the people that submit to him:
     Both he and thou shall [122] stand excommunicate,
     And interdict from church's privilege
     And all society of holy men.
     He grows too proud in his authority,
     Lifting his lofty head above the clouds,
     And, like a steeple, overpeers the church:
     But we'll pull down his haughty insolence;
     And, as Pope Alexander, our progenitor,
     Trod on the neck of German Frederick,
     Adding this golden sentence to our praise,
     "That Peter's heirs should tread on Emperors,
     And walk upon the dreadful adder's back,
     Treading the lion and the dragon down,
     And fearless spurn the killing basilisk,"
     So will we quell that haughty schismatic,
     And, by authority apostolical,
     Depose him from his regal government.

     BRUNO. Pope Julius swore to princely Sigismond,
     For him and the succeeding Popes of Rome,
     To hold the Emperors their lawful lords.

     POPE. Pope Julius did abuse the church's rights,
     And therefore none of his decrees can stand.
     Is not all power on earth bestow'd on us?
     And therefore, though we would, we cannot err.
     Behold this silver belt, whereto is fix'd
     Seven golden seals, fast sealed with seven seals,
     In token of our seven-fold power from heaven,
     To bind or loose, lock fast, condemn or judge,
     Resign or seal, or what so pleaseth us:
     Then he and thou, and all the world, shall stoop,
     Or be assured of our dreadful curse,
     To light as heavy as the pains of hell.

          Re-enter FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS, in the shapes of the
          CARDINALS of France and Padua.

     MEPHIST. Now tell me, Faustus, are we not fitted well?

     FAUSTUS. Yes, Mephistophilis; and two such cardinals
     Ne'er serv'd a holy Pope as we shall do.
     But, whilst they sleep within the consistory,
     Let us salute his reverend fatherhood.

     RAYMOND. Behold, my lord, the Cardinals are return'd.

     POPE. Welcome, grave fathers: answer presently
     What hath [123] our holy council there decreed
     Concerning Bruno and the Emperor,
     In quittance of their late conspiracy
     Against our state and papal dignity?

     FAUSTUS. Most sacred patron of the church of Rome,
     By full consent of all the synod [124]
     Of priests and prelates, it is thus decreed,--
     That Bruno and the German Emperor
     Be held as Lollards and bold schismatics,
     And proud disturbers of the church's peace;
     And if that Bruno, by his own assent,
     Without enforcement of the German peers,
     Did seek to wear the triple diadem,
     And by your death to climb Saint Peter's chair,
     The statutes decretal have thus decreed,--
     He shall be straight condemn'd of heresy,
     And on a pile of faggots burnt to death.

     POPE. It is enough.  Here, take him to your charge,
     And bear him straight to Ponte [125] Angelo,
     And in the strongest tower enclose him fast.
     To-morrow, sitting in our consistory,
     With all our college of grave cardinals,
     We will determine of his life or death.
     Here, take his [126] triple crown along with you,
     And leave it in the church's treasury.
     Make haste again, my good Lord Cardinals,
     And take our blessing apostolical.

     MEPHIST. So, so; was never devil thus bless'd before.

     FAUSTUS. Away, sweet Mephistophilis, be gone;
     The Cardinals will be plagu'd for this anon.
          [Exeunt FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS with BRUNO.]

     POPE. Go presently and bring a banquet forth,
     That we may solemnize Saint Peter's feast,
     And with Lord Raymond, King of Hungary,
     Drink to our late and happy victory.

          A Sennet [127] while the banquet is brought in; and then enter
          FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS in their own shapes.

     MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, come, prepare thyself for mirth:
     The sleepy Cardinals are hard at hand,
     To censure Bruno, that is posted hence,
     And on a proud-pac'd steed, as swift as thought,
     Flies o'er the Alps to fruitful Germany,
     There to salute the woful Emperor.

     FAUSTUS. The Pope will curse them for their sloth to-day,
     That slept both Bruno and his crown away.
     But now, that Faustus may delight his mind,
     And by their folly make some merriment,
     Sweet Mephistophilis, so charm me here,
     That I may walk invisible to all,
     And do whate'er I please, unseen of any.

     MEPHIST. Faustus, thou shalt:  then kneel down presently,
     Whilst on thy head I lay my hand,
     And charm thee with this magic wand.
     First, wear this girdle; then appear
     Invisible to all are here:
     The planets seven, the gloomy air,
     Hell, and the Furies' forked hair,
     Pluto's blue fire, and Hecat's tree,
     With magic spells so compass thee,
     That no eye may thy body see!
     So, Faustus, now, for all their holiness,
     Do what thou wilt, thou shalt not be discern'd.

     FAUSTUS. Thanks, Mephistophilis.--Now, friars, take heed,
     Lest Faustus make your shaven crowns to bleed.

     MEPHIST. Faustus, no more:  see, where the Cardinals come!

          Re-enter the CARDINALS of France and Padua with a book.

     POPE. Welcome, Lord Cardinals; come, sit down.--
     Lord Raymond, take your seat.--Friars, attend,
     And see that all things be [128] in readiness,
     As best beseems this solemn festival.

     CARDINAL OF FRANCE. First, may it please your sacred Holiness
     To view the sentence of the reverend synod
     Concerning Bruno and the Emperor?

     POPE. What needs this question? did I not tell you,
     To-morrow we would sit i' the consistory,
     And there determine of his punishment?
     You brought us word even now, it was decreed
     That Bruno and the cursed Emperor
     Were by the holy council both condemn'd
     For loathed Lollards and base schismatics:
     Then wherefore would you have me view that book?

     CARDINAL OF FRANCE. Your grace mistakes; you gave us no such charge.

     RAYMOND. Deny it not; we all are witnesses
     That Bruno here was late deliver'd you,
     With his rich triple crown to be reserv'd
     And put into the church's treasury.

     BOTH CARDINALS. By holy Paul, we saw them not!

     POPE. By Peter, you shall die,
     Unless you bring them forth immediately!--
     Hale them to [129] prison, lade their limbs with gyves.--
     False prelates, for this hateful treachery
     Curs'd be your souls to hellish misery!
          [Exeunt ATTENDANTS with the two CARDINALS.]

     FAUSTUS. So, they are safe.  Now, Faustus, to the feast:
     The Pope had never such a frolic guest.

     POPE. Lord Archbishop of Rheims, sit down with us.

     ARCHBISHOP. [130] I thank your Holiness.

     FAUSTUS. Fall to; the devil choke you, [131] an you spare!

     POPE. Who is that spoke?--Friars, look about.--
     Lord Raymond, pray, fall to. I am beholding [132]
     To the Bishop of Milan for this so rare a present.

     FAUSTUS. I thank you, sir.
          [Snatches the dish.]

     POPE. How now! who snatch'd the meat from me?
     Villains, why speak you not?--
     My good Lord Archbishop, here's a most dainty dish
     Was sent me from a cardinal in France.

     FAUSTUS. I'll have that too.
          [Snatches the dish.]

     POPE. What Lollards do attend our holiness,
     That we receive such [133] great indignity?
     Fetch me some wine.

     FAUSTUS. Ay, pray, do, for Faustus is a-dry.

     POPE. Lord Raymond,
     I drink unto your grace.

     FAUSTUS. I pledge your grace.
          [Snatches the cup.]

     POPE. My wine gone too!--Ye lubbers, look about,
     And find the man that doth this villany,
     Or, by our sanctitude, you all shall die!--
     I pray, my lords, have patience at this
     Troublesome banquet.

     ARCHBISHOP. Please it [134] your Holiness, I think it be some ghost
     crept out of Purgatory, and now is come unto your Holiness for his
     pardon.

     POPE. It may be so.--
     Go, then, command our priests to sing a dirge,
     To lay the fury of this same troublesome ghost.
          [Exit an ATTENDANT.--The POPE crosses himself.]

     FAUSTUS. How now! must every bit be spic'd with a cross?--
     Nay, then, take that.
          [Strikes the POPE.]

     POPE. O, I am slain!--Help me, my lords!
     O, come and help to bear my body hence!--
     Damn'd be his [135] soul for ever for this deed!
          [Exeunt all except FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS.]

     MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, what will you do now? for I can tell you
     you'll be cursed with bell, book, and candle.

     FAUSTUS. Bell, book, and candle,--candle, book, and bell,--
     Forward and backward, to curse Faustus to hell!

          Re-enter the FRIARS, with bell, book, and candle, for the
          Dirge.

     FIRST FRIAR. Come, brethren, lets about our business with good
     devotion.
          [They sing.]

     CURSED BE HE THAT STOLE HIS HOLINESS' MEAT FROM THE TABLE!
     maledicat Dominus!
     CURSED BE HE THAT STRUCK [136] HIS HOLINESS A BLOW ON [137] THE
     FACE!  maledicat Dominus!
     CURSED BE HE THAT STRUCK FRIAR SANDELO A BLOW ON THE PATE!
     maledicat Dominus!
     CURSED BE HE THAT DISTURBETH OUR HOLY DIRGE!  maledicat
     Dominus!
     CURSED BE HE THAT TOOK AWAY HIS HOLINESS' WINE!  maledicat
     Dominus!

          [MEPHISTOPHILIS and FAUSTUS beat the FRIARS, and fling
          fire-works among them, and exeunt.]

          Enter ROBIN and DICK with a cup.

     DICK. Sirrah Robin, we were best look that your devil can answer
     the stealing of this same [138] cup, for the Vintner's boy follows
     us at the hard heels. [139]

     ROBIN. 'Tis no matter; let him come:  an he follow us, I'll so
     conjure him as he was never conjured in his life, I warrant him.
     Let me see the cup.

     DICK. Here 'tis.
          [Gives the cup to ROBIN.]
     Yonder he comes:  now, Robin, now or never shew thy cunning.

          Enter VINTNER. [140]

     VINTNER. O, are you here?  I am glad I have found you.  You are
     a couple of fine companions:  pray, where's the cup you stole
     from the tavern?

     ROBIN. How, how! we steal a cup! take heed what you say:  we look
     not like cup-stealers, I can tell you.

     VINTNER. Never deny't, for I know you have it; and I'll search you.

     ROBIN. Search me! ay, and spare not.
     --Hold the cup, Dick [Aside to DICK, giving him the cup].--
     Come, come, search me, search me.

          [VINTNER searches him.]

     VINTNER. Come on, sirrah, let me search you now.

     DICK. Ay, ay, do, do.
     --Hold the cup, Robin [Aside to ROBIN, giving him the cup].--
     I fear not your searching: we scorn to steal your [141] cups,
     I can tell you.

          [VINTNER searches him.]

     VINTNER. Never out-face me for the matter; for, sure, the cup
     is between you two.

     ROBIN. Nay, there you lie; 'tis beyond us both.

     VINTNER. A plague take you! I thought 'twas your knavery to take
     it away:  come, give it me again.

     ROBIN. Ay, much! [142] when, can you tell?--Dick, make me a circle,
     and stand close at my back, and stir not for thy life.--Vintner,
     you shall have your cup anon.--Say nothing, Dick.--[Reads from
     a book] O per se, O; Demogorgon; Belcher, and Mephistophilis!

          Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     MEPHIST. You princely legions of infernal rule,
     How am I vexed by these villains' charms!
     From Constantinople have they brought me now,
     Only for pleasure of these damned slaves.
          [Exit VINTNER.]

     ROBIN. By lady, [143] sir, you have had a shrewd journey of it!
     will it please you to [144] take a shoulder of mutton to supper,
     and a tester [145] in your purse, and go back again?

     DICK. Ay, I pray you heartily, sir; for we called you but in jest,
     I promise you.

     MEPHIST. To purge the rashness of this cursed deed,
     First, be thou turned to this ugly shape,
     For apish deeds transformed to an ape.

     ROBIN. O, brave! an ape!  I pray, sir, let me have the carrying
     of him about, to shew some tricks.

     MEPHIST. And so thou shalt:  be thou transformed to a dog, and
     carry him upon thy back.  Away! be gone!

     ROBIN. A dog! that's excellent:  let the maids look well to their
     porridge-pots, for I'll into the kitchen presently.--Come, Dick,
     come.
          [Exeunt ROBIN and DICK.]

     MEPHIST. Now with the flames of ever-burning fire
     I'll wing myself, and forthwith fly amain(sic)
     Unto my Faustus, to the Great Turk's court.
          [Exit.]

          Enter MARTINO and FREDERICK at several doors.

     MARTINO. What, ho, officers, gentlemen!
     Hie to the presence to attend the Emperor.--
     Good Frederick, see the rooms be voided straight:
     His majesty is coming to the hall;
     Go back, and see the state [146] in readiness.

     FREDERICK. But where is Bruno, our elected Pope,
     That on a Fury's back came post from Rome?
     Will not his grace consort the Emperor?

     MARTINO. O, yes; and with him comes the German conjurer,
     The learned Faustus, fame of Wittenberg,
     The wonder of the world for magic art;
     And he intends to shew great Carolus
     The race of all his stout progenitors,
     And bring in presence of his majesty
     The royal shapes and perfect [147] semblances
     Of Alexander and his beauteous paramour.

     FREDERICK. Where is Benvolio?

     MARTINO. Fast asleep, I warrant you;
     He took his rouse [148] with stoops of Rhenish wine
     So kindly yesternight to Bruno's health,
     That all this day the sluggard keeps his bed.

     FREDERICK. See, see, his window's ope! we'll call to him.

     MARTINO. What, ho! Benvolio!

          Enter BENVOLIO above, at a window, in his nightcap, buttoning.

     BENVOLIO. What a devil ail you two?

     MARTINO. Speak softly, sir, lest the devil hear you;
     For Faustus at the court is late arriv'd,
     And at his heels a [149] thousand Furies wait,
     To accomplish whatsoe'er the doctor please.

     BENVOLIO. What of this?

     MARTINO. Come, leave thy chamber first, and thou shalt see
     This conjurer perform such rare exploits,
     Before the Pope and royal Emperor,
     As never yet was seen in Germany.

     BENVOLIO. Has not the Pope enough of conjuring yet?
     He was upon the devil's back late enough:
     An if he be so far in love with him,
     I would he would post with him to Rome again!

     FREDERICK. Speak, wilt thou come and see this sport?

     BENVOLIO. Not I.

     MARTINO. Wilt thou stand in thy window, and see it, then?

     BENVOLIO. Ay, an I fall not asleep i' the mean time.

     MARTINO. The Emperor is at hand, who comes to see
     What wonders by black spells may compass'd be.

     BENVOLIO. Well, go you attend the Emperor.  I am content, for
     this once, to thrust my head out at a [150] window; for they
     say, if a man be drunk over night, the devil cannot hurt him
     in the morning:  if that be true, I have a charm in my head,
     shall control him as well as the conjurer, I warrant you.
          [Exeunt FREDERICK and MARTINO.]

          A Sennet.  Enter CHARLES the German Emperor, BRUNO,
          DUKE OF SAXONY, FAUSTUS, MEPHISTOPHILIS, FREDERICK,
          MARTINO, and Attendants.

     EMPEROR. Wonder of men, renowm'd [151] magician,
     Thrice-learned Faustus, welcome to our court.
     This deed of thine, in setting Bruno free
     From his and our professed enemy,
     Shall add more excellence unto thine art
     Than if by powerful necromantic spells
     Thou couldst command the world's obedience:
     For ever be belov'd of Carolus!
     And if this Bruno, thou hast late redeem'd,
     In peace possess the triple diadem,
     And sit in Peter's chair, despite of chance,
     Thou shalt be famous through [152] all Italy,
     And honour'd of the German Emperor.

     FAUSTUS. These [153] gracious words, most royal Carolus,
     Shall make poor Faustus, to his utmost power,
     Both love and serve the German Emperor,
     And lay his life at holy Bruno's feet:
     For proof whereof, if so your grace be pleas'd,
     The doctor stands prepar'd by power of art
     To cast his magic charms, that shall pierce through [154]
     The ebon gates of ever-burning hell,
     And hale the stubborn Furies from their caves,
     To compass whatsoe'er your grace commands.

     BENVOLIO. Blood, he speaks terribly! but, for all that, I do not
     greatly believe him:  he looks as like a [155] conjurer as the Pope
     to a costermonger. [Aside.]

     EMPEROR. Then, Faustus, as thou late didst promise us,
     We would behold that famous conqueror,
     Great Alexander, and his paramour,
     In their true shapes and state majestical,
     That we may wonder at their excellence.

     FAUSTUS. Your majesty shall see them presently.--
     Mephistophilis, away,
     And, with a solemn noise of trumpets' sound,
     Present before this [156] royal Emperor
     Great Alexander and his beauteous paramour.

     MEPHIST. Faustus, I will.
          [Exit.]

     BENVOLIO. Well, Master Doctor, an your devils come not away
     quickly, you shall have me asleep presently:  zounds, I could
     eat myself for anger, to think I have been such an ass all this
     while, to stand gaping after the devil's governor, and can see
     nothing!

     FAUSTUS.
     I'll make you feel something anon, if my art fail me not.--
     My lord, I must forewarn your majesty,
     That, when my spirits present the royal shapes
     Of Alexander and his paramour,
     Your grace demand [157] no questions of the king,
     But in dumb silence let them come and go.

     EMPEROR. Be it as Faustus please; we are content.

     BENVOLIO. Ay, ay, and I am content too:  an thou bring Alexander
     and his paramour before the Emperor, I'll be Actaeon, and turn
     myself to a stag.

     FAUSTUS. And I'll play Diana, and send you the horns presently.

          Sennet.  Enter, at one door, [158] the EMPEROR ALEXANDER, at
          the other, DARIUS.  They meet.  DARIUS is thrown down;
          ALEXANDER kills him, takes off his crown, and, offering to
          go out, his PARAMOUR meets him.  He embraceth her, and sets
          DARIUS' crown upon her head; and, coming back, both salute
          the EMPEROR, who, leaving his state, [159] offers to embrace
          them; which FAUSTUS seeing, suddenly stays him.  Then trumpets
          cease, and music sounds.

     My gracious lord, you do forget yourself;
     These [160] are but shadows, not substantial.

     EMPEROR. O, pardon me! my thoughts are so ravish'd
     With sight of this renowmed [161] emperor,
     That in mine arms I would have compass'd him.
     But, Faustus, since I may not speak to them,
     To satisfy my longing thoughts [162] at full,
     Let me this tell thee:  I have heard it said
     That this fair lady, whilst [163] she liv'd on earth,
     Had on her neck a little wart or mole;
     How may I prove that saying to be true?

     FAUSTUS. Your majesty may boldly go and see.

     EMPEROR. Faustus, I see it plain;
     And in this sight thou better pleasest me
     Than if I gain'd [164] another monarchy.

     FAUSTUS. Away! be gone! [Exit show.]--See, see, my gracious
     lord! what strange beast is yon, that thrusts his head out at
     window? [165]

     EMPEROR. O, wondrous sight!--See, Duke of Saxony,
     Two spreading horns most strangely fastened
     Upon the head of young Benvolio!

     SAXONY. What, is he asleep or dead?

     FAUSTUS. He sleeps, my lord; but dreams not of his horns.

     EMPEROR. This sport is excellent:  we'll call and wake him.--
     What, ho, Benvolio!

     BENVOLIO. A plague upon you! let me sleep a while.

     EMPEROR. I blame thee not to sleep much, having such a head of
     thine own.

     SAXONY. Look up, Benvolio; 'tis the Emperor calls.

     BENVOLIO. The Emperor! where?--O, zounds, my head!

     EMPEROR. Nay, an thy horns hold, 'tis no matter for thy head,
     for that's armed sufficiently.

     FAUSTUS. Why, how now, Sir Knight! what, hanged by the horns!
     this is [166] most horrible:  fie, fie, pull in your head, for
     shame! let not all the world wonder at you.

     BENVOLIO. Zounds, doctor, this is [167] your villany!

     FAUSTUS. O, say not so, sir! the doctor has no skill,
     No art, no cunning, to present these lords,
     Or bring before this royal Emperor
     The mighty monarch, warlike Alexander.
     If Faustus do it, you are straight resolv'd,
     In bold Actaeon's shape, to turn a stag:--
     And therefore, my lord, so please your majesty,
     I'll raise a kennel of hounds shall hunt him so
     As [168] all his footmanship shall scarce prevail
     To keep his carcass from their bloody fangs.--
     Ho, Belimoth, Argiron, Asteroth! [169]

     BENVOLIO. Hold, hold!--Zounds, he'll raise up a kennel of devils,
     I think, anon.--Good my lord, entreat for me.--'Sblood, I am never
     able to endure these torments.

     EMPEROR. Then, good Master Doctor,
     Let me entreat you to remove his horns;
     He has [170] done penance now sufficiently.

     FAUSTUS. My gracious lord, not so much for injury done to me,
     as to delight your majesty with some mirth, hath Faustus justly
     requited this injurious knight; which being all I desire, I am
     content to remove his horns. [171]--Mephistophilis, transform him
     [MEPHISTOPHILIS removes the horns]:--and hereafter, sir, [172]
     look you speak well of scholars.

     BENVOLIO. Speak well of ye! 'sblood, an scholars be such
     cuckold-makers, to clap horns of [173] honest men's heads o' this
     order, I'll ne'er trust smooth faces and small ruffs more.--But,
     an I be not revenged for this, would I might be turned to a
     gaping oyster, and drink nothing but salt water!
          [Aside, and then exit above.]

     EMPEROR. Come, Faustus:  while the Emperor lives,
     In recompense of this thy high desert,
     Thou shalt command the state of Germany,
     And live belov'd of mighty Carolus.
          [Exeunt.]

     Enter BENVOLIO, MARTINO, FREDERICK, and SOLDIERS.

     MARTINO. Nay, sweet Benvolio, let us sway [174] thy thoughts
     From this attempt against the conjurer. [175]

     BENVOLIO. Away! you love me not, to urge me thus:
     Shall I let slip so great an injury,
     When every servile groom jests at my wrongs,
     And in their rustic gambols proudly say,
     "Benvolio's head was grac'd with horns today?"
     O, may these eyelids never close again,
     Till with my sword I have that [176] conjurer slain!
     If you will aid me in this enterprise,
     Then draw your weapons and be resolute;
     If not, depart:  here will Benvolio die,
     But Faustus' death shall quit my [177] infamy.

     FREDERICK. Nay, we will stay with thee, betide what may,
     And kill that [178] doctor, if he come this way.

     BENVOLIO. Then, gentle Frederick, hie thee to the grove,
     And place our servants and our followers
     Close in an [179] ambush there behind the trees.
     By this, I know the conjurer is near:
     I saw him kneel, and kiss the Emperor's hand,
     And take his leave, laden with rich rewards.
     Then, soldiers, boldly [180] fight:  if Faustus die,
     Take you the wealth, leave us the victory.

     FREDERICK. Come, soldiers, follow me unto the grove:
     Who kills him shall have gold and endless love.
          [Exit FREDERICK with SOLDIERS.]

     BENVOLIO. My head is lighter, than it was, by the horns;
     But yet my heart's [181] more ponderous than my head,
     And pants until I see that [182] conjurer dead.

     MARTINO. Where shall we place ourselves, Benvolio?

     BENVOLIO. Here will we stay to bide the first assault:
     O, were that damned hell-hound but in place,
     Thou soon shouldst see me quit my foul disgrace!

          Re-enter FREDERICK.

     FREDERICK. Close, close! the conjurer is at hand,
     And all alone comes walking in his gown;
     Be ready, then, and strike the [183] peasant down.

     BENVOLIO. Mine be that honour, then.  Now, sword, strike home!
     For horns he gave I'll have his head anon.

     MARTINO. See, see, he comes!

          Enter FAUSTUS with a false head.

     BENVOLIO. No words.  This blow ends all:
     Hell take his soul! his body thus must fall.
          [Stabs FAUSTUS.]

     FAUSTUS. [falling.] O!

     FREDERICK. Groan you, Master Doctor?

     BENVOLIO. Break may his heart with groans!--Dear Frederick, see,
     Thus will I end his griefs immediately.

     MARTINO. Strike with a willing hand.
          [BENVOLIO strikes off FAUSTUS' head.]
                                           His head is off.

     BENVOLIO. The devil's dead; the Furies now [184] may laugh.

     FREDERICK. Was this that stern aspect, that awful frown,
     Made the grim monarch of infernal spirits
     Tremble and quake at his commanding charms?

     MARTINO. Was this that damned head, whose art [185] conspir'd
     Benvolio's shame before the Emperor?

     BENVOLIO. Ay, that's the head, and there [186] the body lies,
     Justly rewarded for his villanies.

     FREDERICK. Come, let's devise how we may add more shame
     To the black scandal of his hated name.

     BENVOLIO. First, on his head, in quittance of my wrongs,
     I'll nail huge forked horns, and let them hang
     Within the window where he yok'd me first,
     That all the world may see my just revenge.

     MARTINO. What use shall we put his beard to?

     BENVOLIO. We'll sell it to a chimney-sweeper:  it will wear out
     ten birchen brooms, I warrant you.

     FREDERICK. What shall his [187] eyes do?

     BENVOLIO. We'll pull [188] out his eyes; and they shall serve for
     buttons to his lips, to keep his tongue from catching cold.

     MARTINO. An excellent policy! and now, sirs, having divided him,
     what shall the body do?
          [FAUSTUS rises.]

     BENVOLIO. Zounds, the devil's alive again!

     FREDERICK. Give him his head, for God's sake.

     FAUSTUS. Nay, keep it:  Faustus will have heads and hands,
     Ay, all [189] your hearts to recompense this deed.
     Knew you not, traitors, I was limited
     For four-and-twenty years to breathe on earth?
     And, had you cut my body with your swords,
     Or hew'd this flesh and bones as small as sand,
     Yet in a minute had my spirit return'd,
     And I had breath'd a man, made free from harm.
     But wherefore do I dally my revenge?--
     Asteroth, Belimoth, Mephistophilis?

          Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS, and other Devils.

     Go, horse these traitors on your fiery backs,
     And mount aloft with them as high as heaven:
     Thence pitch them headlong to the lowest hell.
     Yet, stay: the world shall see their misery,
     And hell shall after plague their treachery.
     Go, Belimoth, and take this caitiff hence,
     And hurl him in some lake of mud and dirt.
     Take thou this other, drag him through [190] the woods
     Amongst [191] the pricking thorns and sharpest briers;
     Whilst, with my gentle Mephistophilis,
     This traitor flies unto some steepy rock,
     That, rolling down, may break the villain's bones,
     As he intended to dismember me.
     Fly hence; despatch my charge immediately.

     FREDERICK. Pity us, gentle Faustus! save our lives!

     FAUSTUS. Away!

     FREDERICK. He must needs go that the devil drives.
          [Exeunt MEPHISTOPHILIS and DEVILS with BENVOLIO, MARTINO,
          and FREDERICK.]

          Enter the ambushed SOLDIERS. [192]

     FIRST SOLDIER. Come, sirs, prepare yourselves in readiness;
     Make haste to help these noble gentlemen:
     I heard them parley with the conjurer.

     SECOND SOLDIER. See, where he comes! despatch and kill the slave.

     FAUSTUS. What's here? an ambush to betray my life!
     Then, Faustus, try thy skill.--Base peasants, stand!
     For, lo, these [193] trees remove at my command,
     And stand as bulwarks 'twixt yourselves and me,
     To shield me from your hated treachery!
     Yet, to encounter this your weak attempt,
     Behold, an army comes incontinent!

          FAUSTUS strikes the door, [194] and enter a DEVIL playing
          on a drum; after him another, bearing an ensign; and divers
          with weapons; MEPHISTOPHILIS with fire-works.  They set upon
          the SOLDIERS, drive them out, and exeunt.

          Enter, at several doors, BENVOLIO, FREDERICK, and MARTINO,
          their heads and faces bloody, and besmeared with mud and
          dirt; all having horns on their heads.

     MARTINO. What, ho, Benvolio!

     BENVOLIO. Here.--What, Frederick, ho!

     FREDERICK. O, help me, gentle friend!--Where is Martino?

     MARTINO. Dear Frederick, here,
     Half smother'd in a lake of mud and dirt,
     Through which the Furies dragg'd me by the heels.

     FREDERICK. Martino, see, Benvolio's horns again!

     MARTINO. O, misery!--How now, Benvolio!

     BENVOLIO. Defend me, heaven! shall I be haunted still?

     MARTINO. Nay, fear not, man; we have no power to kill.

     BENVOLIO. My friends transformed thus!  O, hellish spite!
     Your heads are all set with horns.

     FREDERICK. You hit it right;
     It is your own you mean; feel on your head.

     BENVOLIO. Zounds, [195] horns again!

     MARTINO. Nay, chafe not, man; we all are [196] sped.

     BENVOLIO. What devil attends this damn'd magician,
     That, spite of spite, our wrongs are doubled?

     FREDERICK. What may we do, that we may hide our shames?

     BENVOLIO. If we should follow him to work revenge,
     He'd join long asses' ears to these huge horns,
     And make us laughing-stocks to all the world.

     MARTINO. What shall we, then, do, dear Benvolio?

     BENVOLIO. I have a castle joining near these woods;
     And thither we'll repair, and live obscure,
     Till time shall alter these [197] our brutish shapes:
     Sith black disgrace hath thus eclips'd our fame,
     We'll rather die with grief than live with shame.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter FAUSTUS, a HORSE-COURSER, and MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     HORSE-COURSER. I beseech your worship, accept of these forty dollars.

     FAUSTUS. Friend, thou canst not buy so good a horse for so small
     a price. I have no great need to sell him:  but, if thou likest
     him for ten dollars more, take him, because I see thou hast a
     good mind to him.

     HORSE-COURSER. I beseech you, sir, accept of this:  I am a very
     poor man, and have lost very much of late by horse-flesh, and
     this bargain will set me up again.

     FAUSTUS. Well, I will not stand with thee:  give me the money
     [HORSE-COURSER gives FAUSTUS the money].  Now, sirrah, I must
     tell you that you may ride him o'er hedge and ditch, and spare
     him not; but, do you hear? in any case, ride him not into the
     water.

     HORSE-COURSER. How, sir! not into the water! why, will he not
     drink of all waters?

     FAUSTUS. Yes, he will drink of all waters; but ride him not into
     the water: o'er hedge and ditch, or where thou wilt, but not into
     the water.  Go, bid the hostler deliver him unto you, and remember
     what I say.

     HORSE-COURSER. I warrant you, sir!--O, joyful day! now am I a
     made man for ever.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. What art thou, Faustus, but a man condemn'd to die?
     Thy fatal time draws to a final end;
     Despair doth drive distrust into my thoughts:
     Confound these passions with a quiet sleep:
     Tush, Christ did call the thief upon the Cross;
     Then rest thee, Faustus, quiet in conceit.
          [He sits to sleep.]

          Re-enter the HORSE-COURSER, wet.

     HORSE-COURSER. 0, what a cozening doctor was this!  I, riding
     my horse into the water, thinking some hidden mystery had been
     in the horse, I had nothing under me but a little straw, and had
     much ado to escape [198] drowning.  Well, I'll go rouse him, and
     make him give me my forty dollars again.--Ho, sirrah Doctor, you
     cozening scab!  Master Doctor, awake, and rise, and give me my
     money again, for your horse is turned to a bottle of hay, Master
     Doctor! [He pulls off FAUSTUS' leg].  Alas, I am undone! what
     shall I do? I have pulled off his leg.

     FAUSTUS. O, help, help! the villain hath murdered me.

     HORSE-COURSER. Murder or not murder, now he has [199] but one leg,
     I'll outrun him, and cast this leg into some ditch or other.
          [Aside, and then runs out.]

     FAUSTUS. Stop him, stop him, stop him!--Ha, ha, ha!  Faustus hath
     his leg again, and the Horse-courser a bundle of hay for his
     forty dollars.

          Enter WAGNER.

     How now, Wagner! what news with thee?

     WAGNER. If it please you, the Duke of Vanholt doth earnestly
     entreat your company, and hath sent some of his men to attend
     you, [200] with provision fit for your journey.

     FAUSTUS. The Duke of Vanholt's an honourable gentleman, and one
     to whom I must be no niggard of my cunning.  Come, away!
          [Exeunt.

          Enter ROBIN, DICK, the HORSE-COURSER, and a CARTER.

     CARTER. Come, my masters, I'll bring you to the best beer in
     Europe.--What, ho, hostess! where be these whores?

          Enter HOSTESS.

     HOSTESS. How now! what lack you?  What, my old guess! [201] welcome.

     ROBIN. Sirrah Dick, dost thou [202] know why I stand so mute?

     DICK. No, Robin:  why is't?

     ROBIN. I am eighteen-pence on the score. but say nothing; see
     if she have forgotten me.

     HOSTESS. Who's this that stands so solemnly by himself?  What,
     my old guest!

     ROBIN. O, hostess, how do you?  I hope my score stands still.

     HOSTESS. Ay, there's no doubt of that; for methinks you make no
     haste to wipe it out.

     DICK. Why, hostess, I say, fetch us some beer.

     HOSTESS. You shall presently.--Look up into the hall there, ho!
          [Exit.--Drink is presently brought in.]

     DICK. Come, sirs, what shall we do now [203] till mine hostess comes?

     CARTER. Marry, sir, [204] I'll tell you the bravest tale how a
     conjurer served me.  You know Doctor Faustus?

     HORSE-COURSER. Ay, a plague take him! here's some on's have cause
     to know him.  Did he conjure thee too?

     CARTER. I'll tell you how he served me.  As I was going to
     Wittenberg, t'other day, [205] with a load of hay, he met me, and
     asked me what he should give me for as much hay as he could eat.
     Now, sir, I thinking that a little would serve his turn, bad him
     take as much as he would for three farthings:  so he presently
     gave me my [206] money and fell to eating; and, as I am a cursen [207]
     man, he never left eating till he had eat up all my load of hay.

     ALL. O, monstrous! eat a whole load of hay!

     ROBIN. Yes, yes, that may be; for I have heard of one that has eat
     a load of logs.

     HORSE-COURSER. Now, sirs, you shall hear how villanously he
     served me.  I went to him yesterday to buy a horse of him, and
     he would by no means sell him under forty dollars.  So, sir,
     because I knew him to be such a horse as would run over hedge
     and ditch and never tire, I gave him his money.  So, when I had
     my horse, Doctor Faustus bad me ride him night and day, and spare
     him no time; but, quoth he, in any case, ride him not into the
     water.  Now, sir, I thinking the horse had had some quality [208]
     that he would not have me know of, what did I but rid [209] him
     into a great river? and when I came just in the midst, my horse
     vanished away, and I sate straddling upon a bottle of hay.

     ALL. O, brave doctor!

     HORSE-COURSER. But you shall hear how bravely I served him for
     it.  I went me home to his house, and there I found him asleep.
     I kept a hallooing and whooping in his ears; but all could not
     wake him.  I, seeing that, took him by the leg, and never rested
     pulling till I had pulled me his leg quite off; and now 'tis at
     home in mine hostry.

     ROBIN. And has the doctor but one leg, then? that's excellent;
     for one of his devils turned me into the likeness of an ape's face.

     CARTER. Some more drink, hostess!

     ROBIN. Hark you, we'll into another room and drink a while, and
     then we'll go seek out the doctor.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter the DUKE OF VANHOLT, his DUCHESS, FAUSTUS, MEPHISTOPHILIS,
          and ATTENDANTS.

     DUKE. Thanks, Master Doctor, for these pleasant sights; nor know
     I how sufficiently to recompense your great deserts in erecting
     that enchanted castle in the air, [210] the sight whereof so
     delighted [211] me as nothing in the world could please me more.

     FAUSTUS. I do think myself, my good lord, highly recompensed in
     that it pleaseth [212] your grace to think but well of that which
     Faustus hath performed.--But, gracious lady, it may be that you
     have taken no pleasure in those sights; therefore, I pray you
     tell me, what is the thing you most desire to have; be it in the
     world, it shall be yours: I have heard that great-bellied women
     do long for things are rare and dainty.

     DUCHESS. True, Master Doctor; and, since I find you so kind,
     I will make known unto you what my heart desires to have; and,
     were it now summer, as it is January, a dead time of the winter,
     I would request no better meat than a dish of ripe grapes.

     FAUSTUS. This is but a small matter.--Go, Mephistophilis; away!
          [Exit MEPHISTOPHILIS.]
     Madam, I will do more than this for your content.

          Re-Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with grapes.

     Here now, taste you these: they should be good, for they come [213]
     from a far country, I can tell you.

     DUKE. This makes me wonder more than all the rest, that at this
     time of the year, when every tree is barren of his fruit, from
     whence you had these ripe grapes. [214]

     FAUSTUS. Please it your grace, the year is divided into two
     circles over the whole world; so that, when it is winter with
     us, in the contrary circle it is likewise summer with them, as
     in India, Saba, and such countries that lie far east, where
     they have fruit twice a-year; from whence, by means of a swift
     spirit that I have, I had these grapes brought, as you see.

     DUCHESS. And, trust me, they are the sweetest grapes that e'er
     I tasted.

          The CLOWNS bounce [215] at the gate, within.

     DUKE. What rude disturbers have we at the gate?
     Go, pacify their fury, set it ope,
     And then demand of them what they would have.

          [They knock again, and call out to talk with FAUSTUS.]

     SERVANT. Why, how now, masters! what a coil is there!
     What is the reason you disturb the Duke?

     DICK [within]. We have no reason for it; therefore a fig for him!

     SERVANT. Why, saucy varlets, dare you be so bold?

     HORSE-COURSER [within]. I hope, sir, we have wit enough to be
     more bold than welcome.

     SERVANT. It appears so:  pray, be bold elsewhere, and trouble
     not the Duke.

     DUKE. What would they have?

     SERVANT. They all cry out to speak with Doctor Faustus.

     CARTER [within]. Ay, and we will speak with him.

     DUKE. Will you, sir?--Commit the rascals.

     DICK [within]. Commit with us! he were as good commit with his
     father as commit with us.

     FAUSTUS. I do beseech your grace, let them come in;
     They are good subject for [216] a merriment.

     DUKE. Do as thou wilt, Faustus; I give thee leave.

     FAUSTUS. I thank your grace.

          Enter ROBIN, DICK, CARTER, and HORSE-COURSER.

     Why, how now, my good friends!
     Faith, you are too outrageous:  but, come near;
     I have procur'd your pardons: [217]  welcome, all.

     ROBIN. Nay, sir, we will be welcome for our money, and we will
     pay for what we take.--What, ho! give's half a dozen of beer here,
     and be hanged!

     FAUSTUS. Nay, hark you; can you tell me [218] where you are?

     CARTER. Ay, marry, can I; we are under heaven.

     SERVANT. Ay; but, Sir Saucebox, know you in what place?

     HORSE-COURSER. Ay, ay, the house is good enough to drink in.
     --Zouns, fill us some beer, or we'll break all the barrels in
     the house, and dash out all your brains with your bottles!

     FAUSTUS. Be not so furious:  come, you shall have beer.--
     My lord, beseech you give me leave a while;
     I'll gage my credit 'twill content your grace.

     DUKE. With all my heart, kind doctor; please thyself;
     Our servants and our court's at thy command.

     FAUSTUS. I humbly thank your grace.--Then fetch some beer.

     HORSE-COURSER. Ay, marry, there spake [219] a doctor, indeed!
     and, faith, I'll drink a health to thy wooden leg for that word.

     FAUSTUS. My wooden leg! what dost thou mean by that?

     CARTER. Ha, ha, ha!--Dost hear him, [220] Dick? he has forgot his
     leg.

     HORSE-COURSER. Ay, ay, he does not stand much upon that.

     FAUSTUS. No, faith; not much upon a wooden leg.

     CARTER. Good Lord, that flesh and blood should be so frail with
     your worship!  Do not you remember a horse-courser you sold a
     horse to?

     FAUSTUS. Yes, I remember I sold one a horse.

     CARTER. And do you remember you bid he should not ride him [221]
     into the water?

     FAUSTUS. Yes, I do very well remember that.

     CARTER. And do you remember nothing of your leg?

     FAUSTUS. No, in good sooth.

     CARTER. Then, I pray you, [222] remember your courtesy.

     FAUSTUS. I [223] thank you, sir.

     CARTER. 'Tis not so much worth.  I pray you, tell me one thing.

     FAUSTUS. What's that?

     CARTER. Be both your legs bed-fellows every night together?

     FAUSTUS. Wouldst thou make a Colossus of me, that thou askest me
     such questions?

     CARTER. No, truly, sir; I would make nothing of you; but I would
     fain know that.

          Enter HOSTESS with drink.

     FAUSTUS. Then, I assure thee certainly, they are.

     CARTER. I thank you; I am fully satisfied.

     FAUSTUS. But wherefore dost thou ask?

     CARTER. For nothing, sir:  but methinks you should have a wooden
     bed-fellow of one of 'em.

     HORSE-COURSER. Why, do you hear, sir? did not I [224] pull off
     one of your legs when you were asleep?

     FAUSTUS. But I have it again, now I am awake: look you here, sir.

     ALL. O, horrible! had the doctor three legs?

     CARTER. Do you remember, sir, how you cozened me, and eat up my
     load of----

          [FAUSTUS, in the middle of each speech, charms them dumb.]

     DICK. Do you remember how you made me wear an ape's----

     HORSE-COURSER. You whoreson conjuring scab, do you remember how
     you cozened me with a ho----

     ROBIN. Ha' [225] you forgotten me? you think to carry it away with
     your hey-pass and re-pass:  do you remember the dog's fa----
          [Exeunt CLOWNS.]

     HOSTESS. Who pays for the ale? hear you, Master Doctor; now you
     have sent away my guess, [226] I pray who shall pay me for my a----
          [Exit HOSTESS.]

     DUCHESS. My lord,
     We are much beholding [227] to this learned man.

     DUKE. So are we, madam; which we will recompense
     With all the love and kindness that we may:
     His artful sport [228] drives all sad thoughts away.
          [Exeunt.]

          Thunder and lightning.  Enter DEVILS with covered dishes;
          MEPHISTOPHILIS leads them into FAUSTUS'S study; then enter
          WAGNER.

     WAGNER. I think my master [229] means to die shortly; he has made
     his will, and given me his wealth, his house, his goods, [230] and
     store of golden plate, besides two thousand ducats ready-coined.
     I wonder what he means:  if death were nigh, he would not frolic
     thus.  He's now at supper with the scholars, where there's such
     belly-cheer as Wagner in his life ne'er [231] saw the like:  and,
     see where they come! belike the feast is ended. [232]
          [Exit.]

          Enter FAUSTUS, MEPHISTOPHILIS, and two or three SCHOLARS.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Master Doctor Faustus, since our conference
     about fair ladies, which was the beautifulest in all the world,
     we have determined with ourselves that Helen of Greece was the
     admirablest lady that ever lived:  therefore, Master Doctor, if
     you will do us so much favour as to let us see that peerless
     dame of Greece, whom all the world admires for majesty, we should
     think ourselves much beholding unto you.

     FAUSTUS. Gentlemen,
     For that I know your friendship is unfeign'd,
     It is not Faustus' custom to deny
     The just request of those that wish him well:
     You shall behold that peerless dame of Greece,
     No otherwise for pomp or majesty
     Than when Sir Paris cross'd the seas with her,
     And brought the spoils to rich Dardania.
     Be silent, then, for danger is in words.

          Music sounds.  MEPHISTOPHILIS brings in HELEN; she passeth
          over the stage.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Was this fair Helen, whose admired worth
     Made Greece with ten years' war [233] afflict poor Troy?

     THIRD SCHOLAR. Too simple is my wit [234] to tell her worth,
     Whom all the world admires for majesty.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Now we have seen the pride of Nature's work,
     We'll take our leaves:  and, for this blessed sight,
     Happy and blest be Faustus evermore!

     FAUSTUS. Gentlemen, farewell:  the same wish I to you.
          [Exeunt SCHOLARS.]

          Enter an OLD MAN.

     OLD MAN. O gentle Faustus, leave this damned art,
     This magic, that will charm thy soul to hell,
     And quite bereave thee of salvation!
     Though thou hast now offended like a man,
     Do not persever in it like a devil:
     Yet, yet thou hast an amiable soul,
     If sin by custom grow not into nature;
     Then, Faustus, will repentance come too late;
     Then thou art banish'd from the sight of heaven:
     No mortal can express the pains of hell.
     It may be, this my exhortation
     Seems harsh and all unpleasant:  let it not;
     For, gentle son, I speak it not in wrath,
     Or envy of thee, [235] but in tender love,
     And pity of thy future misery;
     And so have hope that this my kind rebuke,
     Checking thy body, may amend thy soul.

     FAUSTUS. Where art thou, Faustus? wretch, what hast thou done?
     Hell claims his right, and with a roaring voice
     Says, "Faustus, come; thine hour is almost come;"
     And Faustus now will come to do thee right.

          [MEPHISTOPHILIS gives him a dagger.]

     OLD MAN. O, stay, good Faustus, stay thy desperate steps!
     I see an angel hover o'er thy head,
     And, with a vial full of precious grace,
     Offers to pour the same into thy soul:
     Then call for mercy, and avoid despair.

     FAUSTUS. O friend, I feel
     Thy words to comfort my distressed soul!
     Leave me a while to ponder on my sins.

     OLD MAN. Faustus, I leave thee; but with grief of heart,
     Fearing the enemy of thy hapless soul.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. Accursed Faustus, wretch, what hast thou done?
     I do repent; and yet I do despair:
     Hell strives with grace for conquest in my breast:
     What shall I do to shun the snares of death?

     MEPHIST. Thou traitor, Faustus, I arrest thy soul
     For disobedience to my sovereign lord:
     Revolt, or I'll in piece-meal tear thy flesh.

     FAUSTUS. I do repent I e'er offended him.
     Sweet Mephistophilis, entreat thy lord
     To pardon my unjust presumption,
     And with my blood again I will confirm
     The former vow I made to Lucifer.

     MEPHIST. [236] Do it, then, Faustus, with unfeigned heart,
     Lest greater dangers do attend thy drift.

     FAUSTUS. Torment, sweet friend, that base and aged man,
     That durst dissuade me from thy Lucifer,
     With greatest torments [237] that our hell affords.

     MEPHIST. His faith is great; I cannot touch his soul;
     But what I may afflict [238] his body with
     I will attempt, which is but little worth.

     FAUSTUS. One thing, good servant, let me crave of thee,
     To glut the longing of my heart's desire,--
     That I may have unto my paramour
     That heavenly Helen which I saw of late,
     Whose sweet embraces may extinguish clean [239]
     Those thoughts that do dissuade me from my vow,
     And keep my oath [240] I made to Lucifer.

     MEPHIST. This, or what else my Faustus shall desire,
     Shall be perform'd in twinkling of an eye.

          Re-enter HELEN, passing over the stage between two CUPIDS.

     FAUSTUS. Was this the face that launch'd a thousand ships,
     And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?--
     Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss.--
          [Kisses her.]
     Her lips suck forth my soul:  see, where it flies!--
     Come, Helen, come, give me my soul again.
     Here will I dwell, for heaven is in these lips,
     And all is dross that is not Helena.
     I will be Paris, and for love of thee,
     Instead of Troy, shall Wittenberg be sack'd;
     And I will combat with weak Menelaus,
     And wear thy colours on my plumed crest;
     Yea, I will wound Achilles in the heel,
     And then return to Helen for a kiss.
     O, thou art fairer than the evening [241] air
     Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars;
     Brighter art thou than flaming Jupiter
     When he appear'd to hapless Semele;
     More lovely than the monarch of the sky
     In wanton Arethusa's azur'd [242] arms;
     And none but thou shalt [243] be my paramour!
          [Exeunt.]

          Thunder. Enter LUCIFER, BELZEBUB, and MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     LUCIFER. Thus from infernal Dis do we ascend
     To view the subjects of our monarchy,
     Those souls which sin seals the black sons of hell;
     'Mong which, as chief, Faustus, we come to thee,
     Bringing with us lasting damnation
     To wait upon thy soul: the time is come
     Which makes it forfeit.

     MEPHIST. And, this gloomy night,
     Here, in this room, will wretched Faustus be.

     BELZEBUB. And here we'll stay,
     To mark him how he doth demean himself.

     MEPHIST. How should he but in desperate lunacy?
     Fond worldling, now his heart-blood dries with grief;
     His conscience kills it; and his [244] labouring brain
     Begets a world of idle fantasies
     To over-reach the devil; but all in vain;
     His store of pleasures must be sauc'd with pain.
     He and his servant Wagner are at hand;
     Both come from drawing Faustus' latest will.
     See, where they come!

          Enter FAUSTUS and WAGNER.

     FAUSTUS. Say, Wagner,--thou hast perus'd my will,--
     How dost thou like it?

     WAGNER. Sir, So wondrous well,
     As in all humble duty I do yield
     My life and lasting service for your love.

     FAUSTUS. Gramercy, [245] Wagner.

          Enter SCHOLARS.

     Welcome, Gentlemen.
          [Exit WAGNER.]

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Now, worthy Faustus, methinks your looks are chang'd.

     FAUSTUS. O, gentlemen!

     SECOND SCHOLAR. What ails Faustus?

     FAUSTUS. Ah, my sweet chamber-fellow, had I lived with thee,
     then had I lived still! but now must die eternally.  Look, sirs,
     comes he not? comes he not?

     FIRST SCHOLAR. O my dear Faustus, what imports this fear?

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Is all our pleasure turn'd to melancholy?

     THIRD SCHOLAR. He is not well with being over-solitary.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. If it be so, we'll have physicians,
     And Faustus shall be cur'd.

     THIRD SCHOLAR. 'Tis but a surfeit, sir; [246] fear nothing.

     FAUSTUS. A surfeit of deadly [247] sin, that hath damned both
     body and soul.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Yet, Faustus, look up to heaven, and remember
     mercy is infinite.

     FAUSTUS. But Faustus' offence can ne'er be pardoned:  the serpent
     that tempted Eve may be saved, but not Faustus.  O gentlemen,
     hear me [248] with patience, and tremble not at my speeches!  Though
     my heart pant and quiver to remember that I have been a student
     here these thirty years, O, would I had never [249] seen Wittenberg,
     never read book! and what wonders I have done, all Germany can
     witness, yea, all the world; for which Faustus hath lost both
     Germany and the world, yea, heaven itself, heaven, the seat of
     God, the throne of the blessed, the kingdom of joy; and must
     remain in hell for ever, hell.  O, hell, for ever!  Sweet friends,
     what shall become of Faustus, being in hell for ever?

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Yet, Faustus, call on God.

     FAUSTUS. On God, whom Faustus hath abjured! on God, whom Faustus
     hath blasphemed!  O my God, I would weep! but the devil draws in
     my tears.  Gush forth blood, instead of tears! yea, life and soul!
     O, he stays my tongue!  I would lift up my hands; but see, they
     hold 'em, they hold 'em?  ('?' sic)

     ALL. Who, Faustus?

     FAUSTUS. Why, Lucifer and Mephistophilis.  O gentlemen, I gave
     them my soul for my cunning!

     ALL. O, God forbid!

     FAUSTUS. God forbade it, indeed; but Faustus hath done it:  for
     the vain pleasure of four-and-twenty years hath Faustus lost
     eternal joy and felicity.  I writ them a bill with mine own blood:
     the date is expired; this is the time, and he will fetch me.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Why did not Faustus tell us of this before,
     that divines might have prayed for thee?

     FAUSTUS. Oft have I thought to have done so; but the devil
     threatened to tear me in pieces, if I named God, to fetch me
     body and soul, if I once gave ear to divinity:  and now 'tis [250]
     too late.  Gentlemen, away, lest you perish with me.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. O, what may we do to save Faustus?

     FAUSTUS. Talk not of me, but save yourselves, and depart.

     THIRD SCHOLAR. God will strengthen me; I will stay with Faustus.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Tempt not God, sweet friend; but let us into the
     next room, and pray for him.

     FAUSTUS. Ay, pray for me, pray for me; and what noise soever
     you hear, come not unto me, for nothing can rescue me.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Pray thou, and we will pray that God may have mercy
     upon thee.

     FAUSTUS. Gentlemen, farewell:  if I live till morning, I'll visit
     you; if not, Faustus is gone to hell.

     ALL. Faustus, farewell.
          [Exeunt SCHOLARS.]

     MEPHIST. Ay, Faustus, now thou hast no hope of heaven;
     Therefore despair; think only upon hell,
     For that must be thy mansion, there to dwell.

     FAUSTUS. O thou bewitching fiend, 'twas thy temptation
     Hath robb'd me of eternal happiness!

     MEPHIST. I do confess it, Faustus, and rejoice:
     'Twas I that, when thou wert i'the way to heaven,
     Damm'd up thy passage; when thou took'st the book
     To view the Scriptures, then I turn'd the leaves,
     And led thine eye. [251]
     What, weep'st thou? 'tis too late; despair!  Farewell:
     Fools that will laugh on earth must weep in hell.
          [Exit.] [252]

          Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL at several doors.

     GOOD ANGEL. O Faustus, if thou hadst given ear to me,
     Innumerable joys had follow'd thee!
     But thou didst love the world.

     EVIL ANGEL. Gave ear to me,
     And now must taste hell-pains [253] perpetually.

     GOOD ANGEL. O, what will all thy riches, pleasures, pomps,
     Avail thee now?

     EVIL ANGEL. Nothing, but vex thee more,
     To want in hell, that had on earth such store.

     GOOD ANGEL. O, thou hast lost celestial happiness,
     Pleasures unspeakable, bliss without end
     Hadst thou affected sweet divinity,
     Hell or the devil had had no power on thee:
     Hadst thou kept on that way, Faustus, behold,
          [Music, while a throne descends.]
     In what resplendent glory thou hadst sit [254]
     In yonder throne, like those bright-shining saints,
     And triumph'd over hell!  That hast thou lost;
     And now, poor soul, must thy good angel leave thee:
     The jaws of hell are open [255] to receive thee.
          [Exit.  The throne ascends.]

     EVIL ANGEL. Now, Faustus, let thine eyes with horror stare
          [Hell is discovered.]
     Into that vast perpetual torture-house:
     There are the Furies tossing damned souls
     On burning forks; there bodies boil [256] in lead;
     There are live quarters broiling on the coals,
     That ne'er can die; this ever-burning chair
     Is for o'er-tortur'd souls to rest them in;
     These that are fed with sops of flaming fire,
     Were gluttons, and lov'd only delicates,
     And laugh'd to see the poor starve at their gates:
     But yet all these are nothing; thou shalt see
     Ten thousand tortures that more horrid be.

     FAUSTUS. O, I have seen enough to torture me!

     EVIL ANGEL. Nay, thou must feel them, taste the smart of all:
     He that loves pleasure must for pleasure fall:
     And so I leave thee, Faustus, till anon;
     Then wilt thou tumble in confusion.
          [Exit.  Hell disappears.--The clock strikes eleven.]

     FAUSTUS. O Faustus,
     Now hast thou but one bare hour to live,
     And then thou must be damn'd perpetually!
     Stand still, you ever-moving spheres of heaven,
     That time may cease, and midnight never come;
     Fair Nature's eye, rise, rise again, and make
     Perpetual day; or let this hour be but
     A year, a month, a week, a natural day,
     That Faustus may repent and save his soul!
     O lente, lente currite, noctis equi!
     The stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike,
     The devil will come, and Faustus must be damn'd.
     O, I'll leap up to heaven!--Who pulls me down?--
     See, where Christ's blood streams in the firmament! [257]
     One drop of blood will save me:  O my Christ!--
     Rend not my heart for naming of my Christ;
     Yet will I call on him:  O, spare me, Lucifer!--
     Where is it now? 'tis gone:
     And, see, a threatening arm, an [258] angry brow!
     Mountains and hills, come, come, and fall on me,
     And hide me from the heavy wrath of heaven!
     No!
     Then will I headlong run into the earth:
     Gape, earth!  O, no, it will not harbour me!
     You stars that reign'd at my nativity,
     Whose influence hath [259] allotted death and hell,
     Now draw up Faustus, like a foggy mist,
     Into the entrails of yon [260] labouring cloud[s],
     That, when you [261] vomit forth into the air,
     My limbs may issue from your smoky mouths;
     But let my soul mount and ascend to heaven!
          [The clock strikes the half-hour.]
     O, half the hour is past! 'twill all be past anon.
     O, if [262] my soul must suffer for my sin,
     Impose some end to my incessant pain;
     Let Faustus live in hell a thousand years,
     A hundred thousand, and at last [263] be sav'd!
     No end is limited to damned souls.
     Why wert thou not a creature wanting soul?
     Or why is this immortal that thou hast?
     O, Pythagoras' metempsychosis, were that true,
     This soul should fly from me, and I be chang'd
     Into some brutish beast! all beasts are happy,
     For, when they die,
     Their souls are soon dissolv'd in elements;
     But mine must live still to be plagu'd in hell.
     Curs'd be the parents that engender'd me!
     No, Faustus, curse thyself, curse Lucifer
     That hath depriv'd thee of the joys of heaven.
          [The clock strikes twelve.]
     It strikes, it strikes!  Now, body, turn to air,
     Or Lucifer will bear thee quick to hell!
     O soul, be chang'd into small water-drops,
     And fall into the ocean, ne'er be found!

          Thunder.  Enter DEVILS.

     O, mercy, heaven! look not so fierce on me!
     Adders and serpents, let me breathe a while!
     Ugly hell, gape not! come not, Lucifer!
     I'll burn my books!--O Mephistophilis!
          [Exeunt DEVILS with FAUSTUS.]

          Enter SCHOLARS. [264]

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Come, gentlemen, let us go visit Faustus,
     For such a dreadful night was never seen;
     Since first the world's creation did begin,
     Such fearful shrieks and cries were never heard:
     Pray heaven the doctor have escap'd the danger.

     SECOND SCHOLAR.
     O, help us, heaven! [265] see, here are Faustus' limbs,
     All torn asunder by the hand of death!

     THIRD SCHOLAR.
     The devils whom Faustus serv'd have [266] torn him thus;
     For, twixt the hours of twelve and one, methought,
     I heard him shriek and call aloud for help;
     At which self [267] time the house seem'd all on fire
     With dreadful horror of these damned fiends.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Well, gentlemen, though Faustus' end be such
     As every Christian heart laments to think on,
     Yet, for he was a scholar once admir'd
     For wondrous knowledge in our German schools,
     We'll give his mangled limbs due burial;
     And all the students, cloth'd in mourning black,
     Shall wait upon his heavy funeral.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter CHORUS.

     CHORUS. Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight,
     And burned is Apollo's laurel-bough,
     That sometime grew within this learned man.
     Faustus is gone:  regard his hellish fall,
     Whose fiendful fortune may exhort the wise,
     Only to wonder at unlawful things,
     Whose deepness doth entice such forward wits
     To practise more than heavenly power permits.
          [Exit.]

     Terminat hora diem; terminat auctor opus.

     cited,  i.e. THE HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS, ed. 1648.  the

     followed some edition of the HISTORY in which these words,
     or something equivalent to them, had been omitted by mistake.

     Enter WAGNER solus.

WAGNER. Learned Faustus
To know the secrets of Astronomy
Grauen in the booke of Joues high firmament,
Did mount himselfe to scale Olympus top,
Being seated in a chariot burning bright,
Drawne by the strength of yoaky [2to 1624 "yoaked": Dragons necks,
He now is gone to proue Cosmography,
And as I gesse will first arriue at Rome,
To see the Pope and manner of his Court;
And take some part of holy Peters feast,
That to [2tos 1624, 1631, "on": this day is highly solemnized.
     Exit WAGNER.

     Enter FAUSTUS in his Study, and MEPHISTOPHILIS.

FAUSTUS. When I behold the heauens," &c.

The lines which I have here omitted belong to a subsequent part
of the play, where they will be found with considerable additions,
and are rightly assigned to the CHORUS.  (As given in the present
place by the 4tos 1616, 1624, 1631, these lines exhibit the text
of the earlier FAUSTUS; see p. 90, sec. col.) It would seem that
something was intended to intervene here between the exit of Faustus
and Mephistophilis, and their re-appearance on the stage:  compare,
however, the preceding play, p. 88, first col.


     p. 90, sec. col. (Doctor Faustus, from the quarto of 1604):

    "FAUSTUS. Great thanks, mighty Lucifer!
     This will I keep as chary as my life.

     LUCIFER. Farewell, Faustus, and think on the devil.

     FAUSTUS. Farewell, great Lucifer.

     Graven in the book of Jove's high firmament,
     Did mount himself to scale Olympus' top,
     Being seated in a chariot burning bright,
     Drawn by the strength of yoky dragons' necks.
     He now is gone to prove cosmography,
     And, as I guess, will first arrive at Rome,
     To see the Pope and manner of his court,
     And take some part of holy Peter's feast,
     That to this day is highly solemniz'd.

     This part of the play does not have any relevance to characters
     leaving the stage and re-entering.

     Note *, from p. 95. (Doctor Faustus, from the quarto of 1604):

    "Mephistophilis, transform him straight: According to THE
     HISTORY OF DR. FAUSTUS, the knight was not present during
     Faustus's "conference" with the Emperor; nor did he offer
     the doctor any insult by doubting his skill in magic.  We
     are there told that Faustus happening to see the knight
     asleep, "leaning out of a window of the great hall," fixed
     a huge pair of hart's horns on his head; "and, as the knight
     awaked, thinking to pull in his head, he hit his hornes
     against the glasse, that the panes thereof flew about his
     eares:  thinke here how this good gentleman was vexed, for
     he could neither get backward nor forward."  After the emperor
     and the courtiers, to their great amusement, had beheld the
     poor knight in this condition, Faustus removed the horns.
     When Faustus, having taken leave of the emperor, was a league
     and a half from the city, he was attacked in a wood by the
     knight and some of his companions:  they were in armour, and
     mounted on fair palfreys; but the doctor quickly overcame
     them by turning all the bushes into horsemen, and "so
     charmed them, that every one, knight and other, for the
     space of a whole moneth, did weare a paire of goates
     hornes on their browes, and every palfry a paire of oxe
     hornes on his head; and this was their penance appointed
     by Faustus."  A second attempt of the knight to revenge
     himself on Faustus proved equally unsuccessful.  Sigs. G 2,
     I 3, ed. 1648." ]

THE TRAGICAL HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS

FROM THE QUARTO OF 1604.


          Enter CHORUS.

     CHORUS. Not marching now in fields of Thrasymene,
     Where Mars did mate[1] the Carthaginians;
     Nor sporting in the dalliance of love,
     In courts of kings where state is overturn'd;
     Nor in the pomp of proud audacious deeds,
     Intends our Muse to vaunt[2] her[3] heavenly verse:
     Only this, gentlemen,--we must perform
     The form of Faustus' fortunes, good or bad:
     To patient judgments we appeal our plaud,
     And speak for Faustus in his infancy.
     Now is he born, his parents base of stock,
     In Germany, within a town call'd Rhodes:
     Of riper years, to Wertenberg he went,
     Whereas[4] his kinsmen chiefly brought him up.
     So soon he profits in divinity,
     The fruitful plot of scholarism grac'd,
     That shortly he was grac'd with doctor's name,
     Excelling all whose sweet delight disputes
     In heavenly matters of theology;
     Till swoln with cunning,[5] of a self-conceit,
     His waxen wings did mount above his reach,
     And, melting, heavens conspir'd his overthrow;
     For, falling to a devilish exercise,
     And glutted now[6] with learning's golden gifts,
     He surfeits upon cursed necromancy;
     Nothing so sweet as magic is to him,
     Which he prefers before his chiefest bliss:
     And this the man that in his study sits.
          [Exit.]

          FAUSTUS discovered in his study.[7]

     FAUSTUS. Settle thy studies, Faustus, and begin
     To sound the depth of that thou wilt profess:
     Having commenc'd, be a divine in shew,
     Yet level at the end of every art,
     And live and die in Aristotle's works.
     Sweet Analytics, 'tis thou[8] hast ravish'd me!
     Bene disserere est finis logices.
     Is, to dispute well, logic's chiefest end?
     Affords this art no greater miracle?
     Then read no more; thou hast attain'd that[9] end:
     A greater subject fitteth Faustus' wit:
     Bid Economy[10] farewell, and[11] Galen come,
     Seeing, Ubi desinit philosophus, ibi incipit medicus:
     Be a physician, Faustus; heap up gold,
     And be eterniz'd for some wondrous cure:
     Summum bonum medicinae sanitas,
     The end of physic is our body's health.
     Why, Faustus, hast thou not attain'd that end?
     Is not thy common talk found aphorisms?
     Are not thy bills hung up as monuments,
     Whereby whole cities have escap'd the plague,
     And thousand desperate maladies been eas'd?
     Yet art thou still but Faustus, and a man.
     Couldst[12] thou make men[13] to live eternally,
     Or, being dead, raise them to life again,
     Then this profession were to be esteem'd.
     Physic, farewell!  Where is Justinian?

          [Reads.]
     Si una eademque res legatur[14] duobus, alter rem,
     alter valorem rei, &c.

     A pretty case of paltry legacies!

          [Reads.]
     Exhoereditare filium non potest pater, nisi, &c.[15]

     Such is the subject of the institute,
     And universal body of the law:[16]
     This[17] study fits a mercenary drudge,
     Who aims at nothing but external trash;
     Too servile[18] and illiberal for me.
     When all is done, divinity is best:
     Jerome's Bible, Faustus; view it well.

          [Reads.]
     Stipendium peccati mors est.
                                   Ha!
                                        Stipendium, &c.

     The reward of sin is death:  that's hard.

          [Reads.]
     Si peccasse negamus, fallimur, et nulla est in nobis veritas;

     If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and
     there's no truth in us.  Why, then, belike we must sin, and so
     consequently die:
     Ay, we must die an everlasting death.
     What doctrine call you this, Che sera, sera,[19]
     What will be, shall be?  Divinity, adieu!
     These metaphysics of magicians,
     And necromantic books are heavenly;
     Lines, circles, scenes,[20] letters, and characters;
     Ay, these are those that Faustus most desires.
     O, what a world of profit and delight,
     Of power, of honour, of omnipotence,
     Is promis'd to the studious artizan!
     All things that move between the quiet poles
     Shall be at my command:  emperors and kings
     Are but obeyed in their several provinces,
     Nor can they raise the wind, or rend the clouds;
     But his dominion that exceeds in this,
     Stretcheth as far as doth the mind of man;
     A sound magician is a mighty god:
     Here, Faustus, tire[21] thy brains to gain a deity.

          Enter WAGNER.[22]

     Wagner, commend me to my dearest friends,
     The German Valdes and Cornelius;
     Request them earnestly to visit me.

     WAGNER. I will, sir.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. Their conference will be a greater help to me
     Than all my labours, plod I ne'er so fast.

          Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.

     GOOD ANGEL. O, Faustus, lay that damned book aside,
     And gaze not on it, lest it tempt thy soul,
     And heap God's heavy wrath upon thy head!
     Read, read the Scriptures:--that is blasphemy.

     EVIL ANGEL. Go forward, Faustus, in that famous art
     Wherein all Nature's treasure[23] is contain'd:
     Be thou on earth as Jove[24] is in the sky,
     Lord and commander of these elements.[25]
          [Exeunt Angels.]

     FAUSTUS. How am I glutted with conceit of this!
     Shall I make spirits fetch me what I please,
     Resolve[26] me of all ambiguities,
     Perform what desperate enterprise I will?
     I'll have them fly to India for gold,
     Ransack the ocean for orient pearl,
     And search all corners of the new-found world
     For pleasant fruits and princely delicates;
     I'll have them read me strange philosophy,
     And tell the secrets of all foreign kings;
     I'll have them wall all Germany with brass,
     And make swift Rhine circle fair Wertenberg;
     I'll have them fill the public schools with silk,[27]
     Wherewith the students shall be bravely clad;
     I'll levy soldiers with the coin they bring,
     And chase the Prince of Parma from our land,
     And reign sole king of all the[28] provinces;
     Yea, stranger engines for the brunt of war,
     Than was the fiery keel at Antwerp's bridge,[29]
     I'll make my servile spirits to invent.

          Enter VALDES and CORNELIUS.

     Come, German Valdes, and Cornelius,
     And make me blest with your sage conference.
     Valdes, sweet Valdes, and Cornelius,
     Know that your words have won me at the last
     To practice magic and concealed arts:
     Yet not your words only,[30] but mine own fantasy,
     That will receive no object; for my head
     But ruminates on necromantic skill.
     Philosophy is odious and obscure;
     Both law and physic are for petty wits;
     Divinity is basest of the three,
     Unpleasant, harsh, contemptible, and vile:[31]
     'Tis magic, magic, that hath ravish'd me.
     Then, gentle friends, aid me in this attempt;
     And I, that have with concise syllogisms[32]
     Gravell'd the pastors of the German church,
     And made the flowering pride of Wertenberg
     Swarm to my problems, as the infernal spirits
     On sweet Musaeus when he came to hell,
     Will be as cunning[33] as Agrippa[34] was,
     Whose shadow[35] made all Europe honour him.

     VALDES. Faustus, these books, thy wit, and our experience,
     Shall make all nations to canonize us.
     As Indian Moors obey their Spanish lords,
     So shall the spirits[36] of every element
     Be always serviceable to us three;
     Like lions shall they guard us when we please;
     Like Almain rutters[37] with their horsemen's staves,
     Or Lapland giants, trotting by our sides;
     Sometimes like women, or unwedded maids,
     Shadowing more beauty in their airy brows
     Than have the[38] white breasts of the queen of love:
     From[39] Venice shall they drag huge argosies,
     And from America the golden fleece
     That yearly stuffs old Philip's treasury;
     If learned Faustus will be resolute.

     FAUSTUS. Valdes, as resolute am I in this
     As thou to live:  therefore object it not.

     CORNELIUS. The miracles that magic will perform
     Will make thee vow to study nothing else.
     He that is grounded in astrology,
     Enrich'd with tongues, well seen in[40] minerals,
     Hath all the principles magic doth require:
     Then doubt not, Faustus, but to be renowm'd,[41]
     And more frequented for this mystery
     Than heretofore the Delphian oracle.
     The spirits tell me they can dry the sea,
     And fetch the treasure of all foreign wrecks,
     Ay, all the wealth that our forefathers hid
     Within the massy entrails of the earth:
     Then tell me, Faustus, what shall we three want?

     FAUSTUS. Nothing, Cornelius.  O, this cheers my soul!
     Come, shew me some demonstrations magical,
     That I may conjure in some lusty grove,
     And have these joys in full possession.

     VALDES. Then haste thee to some solitary grove,
     And bear wise Bacon's and Albertus'[42] works,
     The Hebrew Psalter, and New Testament;
     And whatsoever else is requisite
     We will inform thee ere our conference cease.

     CORNELIUS. Valdes, first let him know the words of art;
     And then, all other ceremonies learn'd,
     Faustus may try his cunning[43] by himself.

     VALDES. First I'll instruct thee in the rudiments,
     And then wilt thou be perfecter than I.

     FAUSTUS. Then come and dine with me, and, after meat,
     We'll canvass every quiddity thereof;
     For, ere I sleep, I'll try what I can do:
     This night I'll conjure, though I die therefore.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter two SCHOLARS.[44]

     FIRST SCHOLAR. I wonder what's become of Faustus, that was wont
     to make our schools ring with sic probo.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. That shall we know, for see, here comes his boy.

          Enter WAGNER.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. How now, sirrah! where's thy master?

     WAGNER. God in heaven knows.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Why, dost not thou know?

     WAGNER. Yes, I know; but that follows not.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Go to, sirrah! leave your jesting, and tell us
     where he is.

     WAGNER. That follows not necessary by force of argument, that you,
     being licentiates, should stand upon:[45]  therefore acknowledge
     your error, and be attentive.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Why, didst thou not say thou knewest?

     WAGNER. Have you any witness on't?

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Yes, sirrah, I heard you.

     WAGNER. Ask my fellow if I be a thief.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Well, you will not tell us?

     WAGNER. Yes, sir, I will tell you:  yet, if you were not dunces,
     you would never ask me such a question; for is not he corpus
     naturale? and is not that mobile? then wherefore should you
     ask me such a question?  But that I am by nature phlegmatic,
     slow to wrath, and prone to lechery (to love, I would say),
     it were not for you to come within forty foot of the place
     of execution, although I do not doubt to see you both hanged
     the next sessions.  Thus having triumphed over you, I will set
     my countenance like a precisian, and begin to speak thus:--
     Truly, my dear brethren, my master is within at dinner,
     with Valdes and Cornelius, as this wine, if it could speak,
     would[46] inform your worships:  and so, the Lord bless you,
     preserve you, and keep you, my dear brethren, my dear brethren![47]
          [Exit.]

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Nay, then, I fear he is fallen into that damned art
     for which they two are infamous through the world.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Were he a stranger, and not allied to me, yet should
     I grieve for him. But, come, let us go and inform the Rector,
     and see if he by his grave counsel can reclaim him.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. O, but I fear me nothing can reclaim him!

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Yet let us try what we can do.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter FAUSTUS to conjure.[48]

     FAUSTUS. Now that the gloomy shadow of the earth,
     Longing to view Orion's drizzling look,
     Leaps from th' antartic world unto the sky,
     And dims the welkin with her pitchy breath,
     Faustus, begin thine incantations,
     And try if devils will obey thy hest,
     Seeing thou hast pray'd and sacrific'd to them.
     Within this circle is Jehovah's name,
     Forward and backward anagrammatiz'd,[49]
     Th' abbreviated[50] names of holy saints,
     Figures of every adjunct to the heavens,
     And characters of signs and erring[51] stars,
     By which the spirits are enforc'd to rise:
     Then fear not, Faustus, but be resolute,
     And try the uttermost magic can perform.--
     Sint mihi dei Acherontis propitii!  Valeat numen triplex Jehovoe!
     Ignei, aerii, aquatani spiritus, salvete!  Orientis princeps
     Belzebub, inferni ardentis monarcha, et Demogorgon, propitiamus
     vos, ut appareat et surgat Mephistophilis, quod tumeraris:[52]
     per Jehovam, Gehennam, et consecratam aquam quam nunc spargo,
     signumque crucis quod nunc facio, et per vota nostra, ipse nunc
     surgat nobis dicatus[53] Mephistophilis!

          Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     I charge thee to return, and change thy shape;
     Thou art too ugly to attend on me:
     Go, and return an old Franciscan friar;
     That holy shape becomes a devil best.
          [Exit MEPHISTOPHILIS.]

     I see there's virtue in my heavenly words:
     Who would not be proficient in this art?
     How pliant is this Mephistophilis,
     Full of obedience and humility!
     Such is the force of magic and my spells:
     No, Faustus, thou art conjuror laureat,
     That canst command great Mephistophilis:
     Quin regis Mephistophilis fratris imagine.

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS like a Franciscan friar.[54]

     MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, what wouldst thou have me do?

     FAUSTUS. I charge thee wait upon me whilst I live,
     To do whatever Faustus shall command,
     Be it to make the moon drop from her sphere,
     Or the ocean to overwhelm the world.

     MEPHIST. I am a servant to great Lucifer,
     And may not follow thee without his leave:
     No more than he commands must we perform.

     FAUSTUS. Did not he charge thee to appear to me?

     MEPHIST. No, I came hither[55] of mine own accord.

     FAUSTUS. Did not my conjuring speeches raise thee? speak.

     MEPHIST. That was the cause, but yet per accidens;[56]
     For, when we hear one rack the name of God,
     Abjure the Scriptures and his Saviour Christ,
     We fly, in hope to get his glorious soul;
     Nor will we come, unless he use such means
     Whereby he is in danger to be damn'd.
     Therefore the shortest cut for conjuring
     Is stoutly to abjure the Trinity,
     And pray devoutly to the prince of hell.

     FAUSTUS. So Faustus hath
     Already done; and holds this principle,
     There is no chief but only Belzebub;
     To whom Faustus doth dedicate himself.
     This word "damnation" terrifies not him,
     For he confounds hell in Elysium:
     His ghost be with the old philosophers!
     But, leaving these vain trifles of men's souls,
     Tell me what is that Lucifer thy lord?

     MEPHIST. Arch-regent and commander of all spirits.

     FAUSTUS. Was not that Lucifer an angel once?

     MEPHIST. Yes, Faustus, and most dearly lov'd of God.

     FAUSTUS. How comes it, then, that he is prince of devils?

     MEPHIST. O, by aspiring pride and insolence;
     For which God threw him from the face of heaven.

     FAUSTUS. And what are you that live with Lucifer?

     MEPHIST. Unhappy spirits that fell with Lucifer,
     Conspir'd against our God with Lucifer,
     And are for ever damn'd with Lucifer.

     FAUSTUS. Where are you damn'd?

     MEPHIST. In hell.

     FAUSTUS. How comes it, then, that thou art out of hell?

     MEPHIST. Why, this is hell, nor am I out of it:[57]
     Think'st thou that I, who saw the face of God,
     And tasted the eternal joys of heaven,
     Am not tormented with ten thousand hells,
     In being depriv'd of everlasting bliss?
     O, Faustus, leave these frivolous demands,
     Which strike a terror to my fainting soul!

     FAUSTUS. What, is great Mephistophilis so passionate
     For being deprived of the joys of heaven?
     Learn thou of Faustus manly fortitude,
     And scorn those joys thou never shalt possess.
     Go bear these[58] tidings to great Lucifer:
     Seeing Faustus hath incurr'd eternal death
     By desperate thoughts against Jove's[59] deity,
     Say, he surrenders up to him his soul,
     So he will spare him four and twenty[60] years,
     Letting him live in all voluptuousness;
     Having thee ever to attend on me,
     To give me whatsoever I shall ask,
     To tell me whatsoever I demand,
     To slay mine enemies, and aid my friends,
     And always be obedient to my will.
     Go and return to mighty Lucifer,
     And meet me in my study at midnight,
     And then resolve[61] me of thy master's mind.

     MEPHIST. I will, Faustus.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. Had I as many souls as there be stars,
     I'd give them all for Mephistophilis.
     By him I'll be great emperor of the world,
     And make a bridge thorough[62] the moving air,
     To pass the ocean with a band of men;
     I'll join the hills that bind the Afric shore,
     And make that country[63] continent to Spain,
     And both contributory to my crown:
     The Emperor shall not live but by my leave,
     Nor any potentate of Germany.
     Now that I have obtain'd what I desir'd,[64]
     I'll live in speculation of this art,
     Till Mephistophilis return again.
          [Exit.]

          Enter WAGNER[65] and CLOWN.

     WAGNER. Sirrah boy, come hither.

     CLOWN. How, boy! swowns, boy!  I hope you have seen many boys
     with such pickadevaunts[66] as I have:  boy, quotha!

     WAGNER. Tell me, sirrah, hast thou any comings in?

     CLOWN. Ay, and goings out too; you may see else.

     WAGNER. Alas, poor slave! see how poverty jesteth in his nakedness!
     the villain is bare and out of service, and so hungry, that I know
     he would give his soul to the devil for a shoulder of mutton,
     though it were blood-raw.

     CLOWN. How! my soul to the devil for a shoulder of mutton, though
     'twere blood-raw! not so, good friend:  by'r lady,[67] I had need
     have it well roasted, and good sauce to it, if I pay so dear.

     WAGNER. Well, wilt thou serve me, and I'll make thee go like
     Qui mihi discipulus?[68]

     CLOWN. How, in verse?

     WAGNER. No, sirrah; in beaten silk and staves-acre.[69]

     CLOWN. How, how, knaves-acre! ay, I thought that was all the land
     his father left him.  Do you hear?  I would be sorry to rob you of
     your living.

     WAGNER. Sirrah, I say in staves-acre.

     CLOWN. Oho, oho, staves-acre! why, then, belike, if I were your
     man, I should be full of vermin.[70]

     WAGNER. So thou shalt, whether thou beest with me or no.  But,
     sirrah, leave your jesting, and bind yourself presently unto me
     for seven years, or I'll turn all the lice about thee into
     familiars,[71] and they shall tear thee in pieces.

     CLOWN. Do you hear, sir? you may save that labour; they are too
     familiar with me already:  swowns, they are as bold with my flesh
     as if they had paid for their[72] meat and drink.

     WAGNER. Well, do you hear, sirrah? hold, take these guilders.
          [Gives money.]

     CLOWN. Gridirons! what be they?

     WAGNER. Why, French crowns.

     CLOWN. Mass, but for the name of French crowns, a man were as good
     have as many English counters.  And what should I do with these?

     WAGNER. Why, now, sirrah, thou art at an hour's warning, whensoever
     or wheresoever the devil shall fetch thee.

     CLOWN. No, no; here, take your gridirons again.

     WAGNER. Truly, I'll none of them.

     CLOWN. Truly, but you shall.

     WAGNER. Bear witness I gave them him.

     CLOWN. Bear witness I give them you again.

     WAGNER. Well, I will cause two devils presently to fetch thee
     away.--Baliol and Belcher!

     CLOWN. Let your Baliol and your Belcher come here, and I'll
     knock them, they were never so knocked since they were devils:
     say I should kill one of them, what would folks say?  "Do ye see
     yonder tall fellow in the round slop?[73] he has killed the devil."
     So I should be called Kill-devil all the parish over.

          Enter two DEVILS; and the CLOWN runs up and down crying.

     WAGNER. Baliol and Belcher,--spirits, away!
          [Exeunt DEVILS.]

     CLOWN. What, are they gone? a vengeance on them! they have vile[74]
     long nails.  There was a he-devil and a she-devil:  I'll tell you
     how you shall know them; all he-devils has horns, and all
     she-devils has clifts and cloven feet.

     WAGNER. Well, sirrah, follow me.

     CLOWN. But, do you hear? if I should serve you, would you teach
     me to raise up Banios and Belcheos?

     WAGNER. I will teach thee to turn thyself to any thing, to a dog,
     or a cat, or a mouse, or a rat, or any thing.

     CLOWN. How! a Christian fellow to a dog, or a cat, a mouse,
     or a rat! no, no, sir; if you turn me into any thing, let it be
     in the likeness of a little pretty frisking flea, that I may be
     here and there and every where:  O, I'll tickle the pretty wenches'
     plackets!  I'll be amongst them, i'faith.

     WAGNER. Well, sirrah, come.

     CLOWN. But, do you hear, Wagner?

     WAGNER. How!--Baliol and Belcher!

     CLOWN. O Lord!  I pray, sir, let Banio and Belcher go sleep.

     WAGNER. Villain, call me Master Wagner, and let thy left eye be
     diametarily fixed upon my right heel, with quasi vestigiis
     nostris[75] insistere.
          [Exit.]

     CLOWN. God forgive me, he speaks Dutch fustian.  Well, I'll follow
     him; I'll serve him, that's flat.
          [Exit.]

          FAUSTUS discovered in his study.

     FAUSTUS. Now, Faustus, must
     Thou needs be damn'd, and canst thou not be sav'd:
     What boots it, then, to think of God or heaven?
     Away with such vain fancies, and despair;
     Despair in God, and trust in Belzebub:
     Now go not backward; no, Faustus, be resolute:
     Why waver'st thou?  O, something soundeth in mine ears,
     "Abjure this magic, turn to God again!"
     Ay, and Faustus will turn to God again.
     To God? he loves thee not;
     The god thou serv'st is thine own appetite,
     Wherein is fix'd the love of Belzebub:
     To him I'll build an altar and a church,
     And offer lukewarm blood of new-born babes.

          Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.

     GOOD ANGEL. Sweet Faustus, leave that execrable art.

     FAUSTUS. Contrition, prayer, repentance--what of them?

     GOOD ANGEL. O, they are means to bring thee unto heaven!

     EVIL ANGEL. Rather illusions, fruits of lunacy,
     That make men foolish that do trust them most.

     GOOD ANGEL. Sweet Faustus, think of heaven and heavenly things.

     EVIL ANGEL. No, Faustus; think of honour and of[76] wealth.
          [Exeunt ANGELS.]

     FAUSTUS. Of wealth!
     Why, the signiory of Embden shall be mine.
     When Mephistophilis shall stand by me,
     What god can hurt thee, Faustus? thou art safe
     Cast no more doubts.--Come, Mephistophilis,
     And bring glad tidings from great Lucifer;--
     Is't not midnight?--come, Mephistophilis,
     Veni, veni, Mephistophile!

          Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     Now tell me[77] what says Lucifer, thy lord?

     MEPHIST. That I shall wait on Faustus whilst he lives,[78]
     So he will buy my service with his soul.

     FAUSTUS. Already Faustus hath hazarded that for thee.

     MEPHIST. But, Faustus, thou must bequeath it solemnly,
     And write a deed of gift with thine own blood;
     For that security craves great Lucifer.
     If thou deny it, I will back to hell.

     FAUSTUS. Stay, Mephistophilis, and tell me, what good will my soul
     do thy lord?

     MEPHIST. Enlarge his kingdom.

     FAUSTUS. Is that the reason why[79] he tempts us thus?

     MEPHIST. Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris.[80]

     FAUSTUS. Why,[81] have you any pain that torture[82] others!

     MEPHIST. As great as have the human souls of men.
     But, tell me, Faustus, shall I have thy soul?
     And I will be thy slave, and wait on thee,
     And give thee more than thou hast wit to ask.

     FAUSTUS. Ay, Mephistophilis, I give it thee.

     MEPHIST. Then, Faustus,[83] stab thine arm courageously,
     And bind thy soul, that at some certain day
     Great Lucifer may claim it as his own;
     And then be thou as great as Lucifer.

     FAUSTUS. [Stabbing his arm] Lo, Mephistophilis, for love of thee,
     I cut mine arm, and with my proper blood
     Assure my soul to be great Lucifer's,
     Chief lord and regent of perpetual night!
     View here the blood that trickles from mine arm,
     And let it be propitious for my wish.

     MEPHIST. But, Faustus, thou must
     Write it in manner of a deed of gift.

     FAUSTUS. Ay, so I will [Writes].  But, Mephistophilis,
     My blood congeals, and I can write no more.

     MEPHIST. I'll fetch thee fire to dissolve it straight.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. What might the staying of my blood portend?
     Is it unwilling I should write this bill?[84]
     Why streams it not, that I may write afresh?
     FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL:  ah, there it stay'd!
     Why shouldst thou not? is not thy soul shine own?
     Then write again, FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL.

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with a chafer of coals.

     MEPHIST. Here's fire; come, Faustus, set it on.[85]

     FAUSTUS. So, now the blood begins to clear again;
     Now will I make an end immediately.
          [Writes.]

     MEPHIST. O, what will not I do to obtain his soul?
          [Aside.]

     FAUSTUS. Consummatum est; this bill is ended,
     And Faustus hath bequeath'd his soul to Lucifer.
     But what is this inscription[86] on mine arm?
     Homo, fuge:  whither should I fly?
     If unto God, he'll throw me[87] down to hell.
     My senses are deceiv'd; here's nothing writ:--
     I see it plain; here in this place is writ,
     Homo, fuge:  yet shall not Faustus fly.

     MEPHIST. I'll fetch him somewhat to delight his mind.
          [Aside, and then exit.]

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with DEVILS, who give crowns
          and rich apparel to FAUSTUS, dance, and then depart.

     FAUSTUS. Speak, Mephistophilis, what means this show?

     MEPHIST. Nothing, Faustus, but to delight thy mind withal,
     And to shew thee what magic can perform.

     FAUSTUS. But may I raise up spirits when I please?

     MEPHIST. Ay, Faustus, and do greater things than these.

     FAUSTUS. Then there's enough for a thousand souls.
     Here, Mephistophilis, receive this scroll,
     A deed of gift of body and of soul:
     But yet conditionally that thou perform
     All articles prescrib'd between us both.

     MEPHIST. Faustus, I swear by hell and Lucifer
     To effect all promises between us made!

     FAUSTUS. Then hear me read them.  [Reads] ON THESE CONDITIONS
     FOLLOWING.  FIRST, THAT FAUSTUS MAY BE A SPIRIT IN FORM AND
     SUBSTANCE.  SECONDLY, THAT MEPHISTOPHILIS SHALL BE HIS SERVANT,
     AND AT HIS COMMAND.  THIRDLY, THAT MEPHISTOPHILIS SHALL DO FOR HIM,
     AND BRING HIM WHATSOEVER HE DESIRES.[88]  FOURTHLY, THAT HE SHALL
     BE IN HIS CHAMBER OR HOUSE INVISIBLE.  LASTLY, THAT HE SHALL APPEAR
     TO THE SAID JOHN FAUSTUS, AT ALL TIMES, IN WHAT FORM OR SHAPE
     SOEVER HE PLEASE.  I, JOHN FAUSTUS, OF WERTENBERG, DOCTOR, BY
     THESE PRESENTS, DO GIVE BOTH BODY AND SOUL TO LUCIFER PRINCE OF
     THE EAST, AND HIS MINISTER MEPHISTOPHILIS; AND FURTHERMORE GRANT
     UNTO THEM, THAT,[89] TWENTY-FOUR YEARS BEING EXPIRED, THE ARTICLES
     ABOVE-WRITTEN INVIOLATE, FULL POWER TO FETCH OR CARRY THE SAID
     JOHN FAUSTUS, BODY AND SOUL, FLESH, BLOOD, OR GOODS, INTO THEIR
     HABITATION WHERESOEVER.  BY ME, JOHN FAUSTUS.

     MEPHIST. Speak, Faustus, do you deliver this as your deed?

     FAUSTUS. Ay, take it, and the devil give thee good on't!

     MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, ask what thou wilt.

     FAUSTUS. First will I question with thee about hell.
     Tell me, where is the place that men call hell?

     MEPHIST. Under the heavens.

     FAUSTUS. Ay, but whereabout?

     MEPHIST. Within the bowels of these[90] elements,
     Where we are tortur'd and remain for ever:
     Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscrib'd
     In one self place; for where we are is hell,
     And where hell is, there[91] must we ever be:
     And, to conclude, when all the world dissolves,
     And every creature shall be purified,
     All places shall be hell that are[92] not heaven.

     FAUSTUS. Come, I think hell's a fable.

     MEPHIST. Ay, think so still, till experience change thy mind.

     FAUSTUS. Why, think'st thou, then, that Faustus shall be damn'd?

     MEPHIST. Ay, of necessity, for here's the scroll
     Wherein thou hast given thy soul to Lucifer.

     FAUSTUS. Ay, and body too:  but what of that?
     Think'st thou that Faustus is so fond[93] to imagine
     That, after this life, there is any pain?
     Tush, these are trifles and mere old wives' tales.

     MEPHIST. But, Faustus, I am an instance to prove the contrary,
     For I am damn'd, and am now in hell.

     FAUSTUS. How! now in hell!
     Nay, an this be hell, I'll willingly be damn'd here:
     What! walking, disputing, &c.[94]
     But, leaving off this, let me have a wife,[95]
     The fairest maid in Germany;
     For I am wanton and lascivious,
     And cannot live without a wife.

     MEPHIST. How! a wife!
     I prithee, Faustus, talk not of a wife.

     FAUSTUS. Nay, sweet Mephistophilis, fetch me one, for I will have
     one.

     MEPHIST. Well, thou wilt have one?  Sit there till I come:  I'll
     fetch thee a wife in the devil's name.
          [Exit.]

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with a DEVIL drest like a WOMAN,
          with fire-works.

     MEPHIST. Tell me,[96] Faustus, how dost thou like thy wife?

     FAUSTUS. A plague on her for a hot whore!

     MEPHIST. Tut, Faustus,
     Marriage is but a ceremonial toy;
     If thou lovest me, think no[97] more of it.
     I'll cull thee out the fairest courtezans,
     And bring them every morning to thy bed:
     She whom thine eye shall like, thy heart shall have,
     Be she as chaste as was Penelope,
     As wise as Saba,[98] or as beautiful
     As was bright Lucifer before his fall.
     Hold, take this book, peruse it thoroughly:
          [Gives book.]

     The iterating[99] of these lines brings gold;
     The framing of this circle on the ground
     Brings whirlwinds, tempests, thunder, and lightning;
     Pronounce this thrice devoutly to thyself,
     And men in armour shall appear to thee,
     Ready to execute what thou desir'st.

     FAUSTUS. Thanks, Mephistophilis:  yet fain would I have a book
     wherein I might behold all spells and incantations, that I
     might raise up spirits when I please.

     MEPHIST. Here they are in this book.
          [Turns to them.]

     FAUSTUS. Now would I have a book where I might see all characters
     and planets of the heavens, that I might know their motions and
     dispositions.

     MEPHIST. Here they are too.
          [Turns to them.]

     FAUSTUS. Nay, let me have one book more,--and then I have done,--
     wherein I might see all plants, herbs, and trees, that grow upon
     the earth.

     MEPHIST. Here they be.

     FAUSTUS. O, thou art deceived.

     MEPHIST. Tut, I warrant thee.
          [Turns to them.]

     FAUSTUS. When I behold the heavens, then I repent,
     And curse thee, wicked Mephistophilis,
     Because thou hast depriv'd me of those joys.

     MEPHIST. Why, Faustus,
     Thinkest thou heaven is such a glorious thing?
     I tell thee, 'tis not half so fair as thou,
     Or any man that breathes on earth.

     FAUSTUS. How prov'st thou that?

     MEPHIST. 'Twas made for man, therefore is man more excellent.

     FAUSTUS. If it were made for man, 'twas made for me:
     I will renounce this magic and repent.

          Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.

     GOOD ANGEL. Faustus, repent; yet God will pity thee.

     EVIL ANGEL. Thou art a spirit; God cannot pity thee.

     FAUSTUS. Who buzzeth in mine ears I am a spirit?
     Be I a devil, yet God may pity me;
     Ay, God will pity me, if I repent.

     EVIL ANGEL. Ay, but Faustus never shall repent.
          [Exeunt ANGELS.]

     FAUSTUS. My heart's so harden'd, I cannot repent:
     Scarce can I name salvation, faith, or heaven,
     But fearful echoes thunder in mine ears,
     "Faustus, thou art damn'd!" then swords, and knives,
     Poison, guns, halters, and envenom'd steel
     Are laid before me to despatch myself;
     And long ere this I should have slain myself,
     Had not sweet pleasure conquer'd deep despair.
     Have not I made blind Homer sing to me
     Of Alexander's love and Oenon's death?
     And hath not he, that built the walls of Thebes
     With ravishing sound of his melodious harp,
     Made music with my Mephistophilis?
     Why should I die, then, or basely despair?
     I am resolv'd; Faustus shall ne'er repent.--
     Come, Mephistophilis, let us dispute again,
     And argue of divine astrology.[100]
     Tell me, are there many heavens above the moon
     Are all celestial bodies but one globe,
     As is the substance of this centric earth?

     MEPHIST. As are the elements, such are the spheres,
     Mutually folded in each other's orb,
     And, Faustus,
     All jointly move upon one axletree,
     Whose terminine is term'd the world's wide pole;
     Nor are the names of Saturn, Mars, or Jupiter
     Feign'd, but are erring[101] stars.

     FAUSTUS. But, tell me, have they all one motion, both situ et
     tempore?

     MEPHIST. All jointly move from east to west in twenty-four hours
     upon the poles of the world; but differ in their motion upon
     the poles of the zodiac.

     FAUSTUS. Tush,
     These slender trifles Wagner can decide:
     Hath Mephistophilis no greater skill?
     Who knows not the double motion of the planets?
     The first is finish'd in a natural day;
     The second thus; as Saturn in thirty years; Jupiter in twelve;
     Mars in four; the Sun, Venus, and Mercury in a year; the Moon in
     twenty-eight days.  Tush, these are freshmen's[102] suppositions.
     But, tell me, hath every sphere a dominion or intelligentia?

     MEPHIST. Ay.

     FAUSTUS. How many heavens or spheres are there?

     MEPHIST. Nine; the seven planets, the firmament, and the empyreal
     heaven.

     FAUSTUS. Well, resolve[103] me in this question; why have we not
     conjunctions, oppositions, aspects, eclipses, all at one time,
     but in some years we have more, in some less?

     MEPHIST. Per inoequalem motum respectu totius.

     FAUSTUS. Well, I am answered.  Tell me who made the world?

     MEPHIST. I will not.

     FAUSTUS. Sweet Mephistophilis, tell me.

     MEPHIST. Move me not, for I will not tell thee.

     FAUSTUS. Villain, have I not bound thee to tell me any thing?

     MEPHIST. Ay, that is not against our kingdom; but this is.  Think
     thou on hell, Faustus, for thou art damned.

     FAUSTUS. Think, Faustus, upon God that made the world.

     MEPHIST. Remember this.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. Ay, go, accursed spirit, to ugly hell!
     'Tis thou hast damn'd distressed Faustus' soul.
     Is't not too late?

          Re-enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.

     EVIL ANGEL. Too late.

     GOOD ANGEL. Never too late, if Faustus can repent.

     EVIL ANGEL. If thou repent, devils shall tear thee in pieces.

     GOOD ANGEL. Repent, and they shall never raze thy skin.
          [Exeunt ANGELS.]

     FAUSTUS. Ah, Christ, my Saviour,
     Seek to save[104] distressed Faustus' soul!

          Enter LUCIFER, BELZEBUB, and MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     LUCIFER. Christ cannot save thy soul, for he is just:
     There's none but I have interest in the same.

     FAUSTUS. O, who art thou that look'st so terrible?

     LUCIFER. I am Lucifer,
     And this is my companion-prince in hell.

     FAUSTUS. O, Faustus, they are come to fetch away thy soul!

     LUCIFER. We come to tell thee thou dost injure us;
     Thou talk'st of Christ, contrary to thy promise:
     Thou shouldst not think of God:  think of the devil,
     And of his dam too.

     FAUSTUS. Nor will I henceforth:  pardon me in this,
     And Faustus vows never to look to heaven,
     Never to name God, or to pray to him,
     To burn his Scriptures, slay his ministers,
     And make my spirits pull his churches down.

     LUCIFER. Do so, and we will highly gratify thee.  Faustus, we are
     come from hell to shew thee some pastime:  sit down, and thou
     shalt see all the Seven Deadly Sins appear in their proper shapes.

     FAUSTUS. That sight will be as pleasing unto me,
     As Paradise was to Adam, the first day
     Of his creation.

     LUCIFER. Talk not of Paradise nor creation; but mark this show:
     talk of the devil, and nothing else.--Come away!

          Enter the SEVEN DEADLY SINS.[105]

     Now, Faustus, examine them of their several names and dispositions.

     FAUSTUS. What art thou, the first?

     PRIDE. I am Pride.  I disdain to have any parents.  I am like to
     Ovid's flea; I can creep into every corner of a wench; sometimes,
     like a perriwig, I sit upon her brow; or, like a fan of feathers,
     I kiss her lips; indeed, I do--what do I not?  But, fie, what a
     scent is here!  I'll not speak another word, except the ground
     were perfumed, and covered with cloth of arras.

     FAUSTUS. What art thou, the second?

     COVETOUSNESS. I am Covetousness, begotten of an old churl, in an
     old leathern bag:  and, might I have my wish, I would desire that
     this house and all the people in it were turned to gold, that I
     might lock you up in my good chest:  O, my sweet gold!

     FAUSTUS. What art thou, the third?

     WRATH. I am Wrath.  I had neither father nor mother:  I leapt out
     of a lion's mouth when I was scarce half-an-hour old; and ever
     since I have run up and down the world with this case[106]
     of rapiers, wounding myself when I had nobody to fight withal.
     I was born in hell; and look to it, for some of you shall be
     my father.

     FAUSTUS. What art thou, the fourth?

     ENVY. I am Envy, begotten of a chimney-sweeper and an oyster-wife.
     I cannot read, and therefore wish all books were burnt.  I am lean
     with seeing others eat.  O, that there would come a famine through
     all the world, that all might die, and I live alone! then thou
     shouldst see how fat I would be.  But must thou sit, and I stand?
     come down, with a vengeance!

     FAUSTUS. Away, envious rascal!--What art thou, the fifth?

     GLUTTONY. Who I, sir?  I am Gluttony.  My parents are all dead,
     and the devil a penny they have left me, but a bare pension, and
     that is thirty meals a-day and ten bevers,[107]--a small trifle
     to suffice nature.  O, I come of a royal parentage! my grandfather
     was a Gammon of Bacon, my grandmother a Hogshead of Claret-wine;
     my godfathers were these, Peter Pickle-herring and Martin
     Martlemas-beef; O, but my godmother, she was a jolly gentlewoman,
     and well-beloved in every good town and city; her name was Mistress
     Margery March-beer.  Now, Faustus, thou hast heard all my progeny;
     wilt thou bid me to supper?

     FAUSTUS. No, I'll see thee hanged:  thou wilt eat up all my victuals.

     GLUTTONY. Then the devil choke thee!

     FAUSTUS. Choke thyself, glutton!--What art thou, the sixth?

     SLOTH. I am Sloth.  I was begotten on a sunny bank, where I have
     lain ever since; and you have done me great injury to bring me
     from thence:  let me be carried thither again by Gluttony and
     Lechery.  I'll not speak another word for a king's ransom.

     FAUSTUS. What are you, Mistress Minx, the seventh and last?

     LECHERY. Who I, sir?  I am one that loves an inch of raw mutton
     better than an ell of fried stock-fish; and the first letter
     of my name begins with L.[108]

     FAUSTUS. Away, to hell, to hell![109]
          [Exeunt the SINS.]

     LUCIFER. Now, Faustus, how dost thou like this?

     FAUSTUS. O, this feeds my soul!

     LUCIFER. Tut, Faustus, in hell is all manner of delight.

     FAUSTUS. O, might I see hell, and return again,
     How happy were I then!

     LUCIFER. Thou shalt; I will send for thee at midnight.[110]
     In meantime take this book; peruse it throughly,
     And thou shalt turn thyself into what shape thou wilt.

     FAUSTUS. Great thanks, mighty Lucifer!
     This will I keep as chary as my life.

     LUCIFER. Farewell, Faustus, and think on the devil.

     FAUSTUS. Farewell, great Lucifer.
          [Exeunt LUCIFER and BELZEBUB.]

     Come, Mephistophilis.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter CHORUS.[111]

     CHORUS. Learned Faustus,
     To know the secrets of astronomy[112]
     Graven in the book of Jove's high firmament,
     Did mount himself to scale Olympus' top,
     Being seated in a chariot burning bright,
     Drawn by the strength of yoky dragons' necks.
     He now is gone to prove cosmography,
     And, as I guess, will first arrive at Rome,
     To see the Pope and manner of his court,
     And take some part of holy Peter's feast,
     That to this day is highly solemniz'd.
          [Exit.]

          Enter FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS.[113]

     FAUSTUS. Having now, my good Mephistophilis,
     Pass'd with delight the stately town of Trier,[114]
     Environ'd round with airy mountain-tops,
     With walls of flint, and deep-entrenched lakes,
     Not to be won by any conquering prince;
     From Paris next,[115] coasting the realm of France,
     We saw the river Maine fall into Rhine,
     Whose banks are set with groves of fruitful vines;
     Then up to Naples, rich Campania,
     Whose buildings fair and gorgeous to the eye,
     The streets straight forth, and pav'd with finest brick,
     Quarter the town in four equivalents:
     There saw we learned Maro's golden tomb,
     The way he cut,[116] an English mile in length,
     Thorough a rock of stone, in one night's space;
     From thence to Venice, Padua, and the rest,
     In one of which a sumptuous temple stands,[117]
     That threats the stars with her aspiring top.
     Thus hitherto hath Faustus spent his time:
     But tell me now what resting-place is this?
     Hast thou, as erst I did command,
     Conducted me within the walls of Rome?

     MEPHIST. Faustus, I have; and, because we will not be unprovided,
     I have taken up his Holiness' privy-chamber for our use.

     FAUSTUS. I hope his Holiness will bid us welcome.

     MEPHIST.
     Tut, 'tis no matter; man; we'll be bold with his good cheer.
     And now, my Faustus, that thou mayst perceive
     What Rome containeth to delight thee with,
     Know that this city stands upon seven hills
     That underprop the groundwork of the same:
     Just through the midst[118] runs flowing Tiber's stream
     With winding banks that cut it in two parts;
     Over the which four stately bridges lean,
     That make safe passage to each part of Rome:
     Upon the bridge call'd Ponte[119] Angelo
     Erected is a castle passing strong,
     Within whose walls such store of ordnance are,
     And double cannons fram'd of carved brass,
     As match the days within one complete year;
     Besides the gates, and high pyramides,
     Which Julius Caesar brought from Africa.

     FAUSTUS. Now, by the kingdoms of infernal rule,
     Of Styx, of[120] Acheron, and the fiery lake
     Of ever-burning Phlegethon, I swear
     That I do long to see the monuments
     And situation of bright-splendent Rome:
     Come, therefore, let's away.

     MEPHIST. Nay, Faustus, stay:  I know you'd fain see the Pope,
     And take some part of holy Peter's feast,
     Where thou shalt see a troop of bald-pate friars,
     Whose summum bonum is in belly-cheer.

     FAUSTUS. Well, I'm content to compass then some sport,
     And by their folly make us merriment.
     Then charm me, that I[121]
     May be invisible, to do what I please,
     Unseen of any whilst I stay in Rome.
          [Mephistophilis charms him.]

     MEPHIST. So, Faustus; now
     Do what thou wilt, thou shalt not be discern'd.

          Sound a Sonnet.[122] Enter the POPE and the CARDINAL OF
          LORRAIN to the banquet, with FRIARS attending.

     POPE. My Lord of Lorrain, will't please you draw near?

     FAUSTUS. Fall to, and the devil choke you, an you spare!

     POPE. How now! who's that which spake?--Friars, look about.

     FIRST FRIAR. Here's nobody, if it like your Holiness.

     POPE. My lord, here is a dainty dish was sent me from the Bishop
     of Milan.

     FAUSTUS. I thank you, sir.
          [Snatches the dish.]

     POPE. How now! who's that which snatched the meat from me? will
     no man look?--My lord, this dish was sent me from the Cardinal
     of Florence.

     FAUSTUS. You say true; I'll ha't.
          [Snatches the dish.]

     POPE. What, again!--My lord, I'll drink to your grace.

     FAUSTUS. I'll pledge your grace.
          [Snatches the cup.]

     C. OF LOR. My lord, it may be some ghost, newly crept out of
     Purgatory, come to beg a pardon of your Holiness.

     POPE. It may be so.--Friars, prepare a dirge to lay the fury
     of this ghost.--Once again, my lord, fall to.
          [The POPE crosses himself.]

     FAUSTUS. What, are you crossing of yourself?
     Well, use that trick no more, I would advise you.
          [The POPE crosses himself again.]

     Well, there's the second time.  Aware the third;
     I give you fair warning.
          [The POPE crosses himself again, and FAUSTUS hits him a box
           of the ear; and they all run away.]

     Come on, Mephistophilis; what shall we do?

     MEPHIST. Nay, I know not:  we shall be cursed with bell, book,
     and candle.

     FAUSTUS. How! bell, book, and candle,--candle, book, and bell,--
     Forward and backward, to curse Faustus to hell!
     Anon you shall hear a hog grunt, a calf bleat, and an ass bray,
     Because it is Saint Peter's holiday.

          Re-enter all the FRIARS to sing the Dirge.

     FIRST FRIAR.
     Come, brethren, let's about our business with good devotion.

          They sing.

     CURSED BE HE THAT STOLE AWAY HIS HOLINESS' MEAT FROM THE
     TABLE!  maledicat Dominus!
     CURSED BE HE THAT STRUCK HIS HOLINESS A BLOW ON THE FACE!
     maledicat Dominus!
     CURSED BE HE THAT TOOK FRIAR SANDELO A BLOW ON THE PATE!
     maledicat Dominus!
     CURSED BE HE THAT DISTURBETH OUR HOLY DIRGE!  maledicat
     Dominus!
     CURSED BE HE THAT TOOK AWAY HIS HOLINESS' WINE!  maledicat
     Dominus?  ['?' sic]
          Et omnes Sancti!  Amen!

          [MEPHISTOPHILIS and FAUSTUS beat the FRIARS, and fling
           fire-works among them; and so exeunt.]

          Enter CHORUS.

     CHORUS. When Faustus had with pleasure ta'en the view
     Of rarest things, and royal courts of kings,
     He stay'd his course, and so returned home;
     Where such as bear his absence but with grief,
     I mean his friends and near'st companions,
     Did gratulate his safety with kind words,
     And in their conference of what befell,
     Touching his journey through the world and air,
     They put forth questions of astrology,
     Which Faustus answer'd with such learned skill
     As they admir'd and wonder'd at his wit.
     Now is his fame spread forth in every land:
     Amongst the rest the Emperor is one,
     Carolus the Fifth, at whose palace now
     Faustus is feasted 'mongst his noblemen.
     What there he did, in trial of his art,
     I leave untold; your eyes shall see['t] perform'd.
          [Exit.]

          Enter ROBIN[123] the Ostler, with a book in his hand.

     ROBIN. O, this is admirable! here I ha' stolen one of Doctor
     Faustus' conjuring-books, and, i'faith, I mean to search some
     circles for my own use.  Now will I make all the maidens in our
     parish dance at my pleasure, stark naked, before me; and so
     by that means I shall see more than e'er I felt or saw yet.

          Enter RALPH, calling ROBIN.

     RALPH. Robin, prithee, come away; there's a gentleman tarries
     to have his horse, and he would have his things rubbed and made
     clean:  he keeps such a chafing with my mistress about it; and
     she has sent me to look thee out; prithee, come away.

     ROBIN. Keep out, keep out, or else you are blown up, you are
     dismembered, Ralph:  keep out, for I am about a roaring piece
     of work.

     RALPH. Come, what doest thou with that same book? thou canst
     not read?

     ROBIN. Yes, my master and mistress shall find that I can read,
     he for his forehead, she for her private study; she's born to
     bear with me, or else my art fails.

     RALPH. Why, Robin, what book is that?

     ROBIN. What book! why, the most intolerable book for conjuring
     that e'er was invented by any brimstone devil.

     RALPH. Canst thou conjure with it?

     ROBIN. I can do all these things easily with it; first, I can
     make thee drunk with ippocras[124] at any tabern[125] in Europe
     for nothing; that's one of my conjuring works.

     RALPH. Our Master Parson says that's nothing.

     ROBIN. True, Ralph:  and more, Ralph, if thou hast any mind to
     Nan Spit, our kitchen-maid, then turn her and wind her to thy own
     use, as often as thou wilt, and at midnight.

     RALPH. O, brave, Robin! shall I have Nan Spit, and to mine own
     use?  On that condition I'll feed thy devil with horse-bread as
     long as he lives, of free cost.

     ROBIN. No more, sweet Ralph:  let's go and make clean our boots,
     which lie foul upon our hands, and then to our conjuring in the
     devil's name.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter ROBIN and RALPH[126] with a silver goblet.

     ROBIN. Come, Ralph:  did not I tell thee, we were for ever made
     by this Doctor Faustus' book? ecce, signum! here's a simple
     purchase[127] for horse-keepers:  our horses shall eat no hay as
     long as this lasts.

     RALPH. But, Robin, here comes the Vintner.

     ROBIN. Hush!  I'll gull him supernaturally.

          Enter VINTNER.

     Drawer,[128] I hope all is paid; God be with you!--Come, Ralph.

     VINTNER. Soft, sir; a word with you.  I must yet have a goblet paid
     from you, ere you go.

     ROBIN. I a goblet, Ralph, I a goblet!--I scorn you; and you are
     but a, &c.  I a goblet! search me.

     VINTNER. I mean so, sir, with your favour.
          [Searches ROBIN.]

     ROBIN. How say you now?

     VINTNER. I must say somewhat to your fellow.--You, sir!

     RALPH. Me, sir! me, sir! search your fill.  [VINTNER searches him.]
     Now, sir, you may be ashamed to burden honest men with a matter
     of truth.

     VINTNER. Well, tone[129] of you hath this goblet about you.

     ROBIN. You lie, drawer, 'tis afore me [Aside].--Sirrah you, I'll
     teach you to impeach honest men;--stand by;--I'll scour you for
     a goblet;--stand aside you had best, I charge you in the name of
     Belzebub.--Look to the goblet, Ralph [Aside to RALPH].

     VINTNER. What mean you, sirrah?

     ROBIN. I'll tell you what I mean.  [Reads from a book] Sanctobulorum
     Periphrasticon--nay, I'll tickle you, Vintner.--Look to the goblet,
     Ralph [Aside to RALPH].--[Reads] Polypragmos Belseborams framanto
     pacostiphos tostu, Mephistophilis, &c.

          Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS, sets squibs at their backs, and then
          exit.  They run about.

     VINTNER. O, nomine Domini! what meanest thou, Robin? thou hast no
     goblet.

     RALPH. Peccatum peccatorum!--Here's thy goblet, good Vintner.
          [Gives the goblet to VINTNER, who exit.]

     ROBIN. Misericordia pro nobis! what shall I do?  Good devil, forgive
     me now, and I'll never rob thy library more.

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     MEPHIST. Monarch of Hell,[130] under whose black survey
     Great potentates do kneel with awful fear,
     Upon whose altars thousand souls do lie,
     How am I vexed with these villains' charms?
     From Constantinople am I hither come,
     Only for pleasure of these damned slaves.

     ROBIN. How, from Constantinople! you have had a great journey:
     will you take sixpence in your purse to pay for your supper, and
     be gone?

     MEPHIST. Well, villains, for your presumption, I transform thee
     into an ape, and thee into a dog; and so be gone!
          [Exit.]

     ROBIN. How, into an ape! that's brave:  I'll have fine sport with
     the boys; I'll get nuts and apples enow.

     RALPH. And I must be a dog.

     ROBIN. I'faith, thy head will never be out of the pottage-pot.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter EMPEROR,[131] FAUSTUS, and a KNIGHT, with ATTENDANTS.

     EMPEROR. Master Doctor Faustus,[132] I have heard strange report
     of thy knowledge in the black art, how that none in my empire
     nor in the whole world can compare with thee for the rare effects
     of magic:  they say thou hast a familiar spirit, by whom thou canst
     accomplish what thou list.  This, therefore, is my request, that
     thou let me see some proof of thy skill, that mine eyes may be
     witnesses to confirm what mine ears have heard reported:  and here
     I swear to thee, by the honour of mine imperial crown, that,
     whatever thou doest, thou shalt be no ways prejudiced or endamaged.

     KNIGHT. I'faith, he looks much like a conjurer.
          [Aside.]

     FAUSTUS. My gracious sovereign, though I must confess myself far
     inferior to the report men have published, and nothing answerable
     to the honour of your imperial majesty, yet, for that love and duty
     binds me thereunto, I am content to do whatsoever your majesty
     shall command me.

     EMPEROR. Then, Doctor Faustus, mark what I shall say.
     As I was sometime solitary set
     Within my closet, sundry thoughts arose
     About the honour of mine ancestors,
     How they had won[133] by prowess such exploits,
     Got such riches, subdu'd so many kingdoms,
     As we that do succeed,[134] or they that shall
     Hereafter possess our throne, shall
     (I fear me) ne'er attain to that degree
     Of high renown and great authority:
     Amongst which kings is Alexander the Great,
     Chief spectacle of the world's pre-eminence,
     The bright[135] shining of whose glorious acts
     Lightens the world with his reflecting beams,
     As when I hear but motion made of him,
     It grieves my soul I never saw the man:
     If, therefore, thou, by cunning of thine art,
     Canst raise this man from hollow vaults below,
     Where lies entomb'd this famous conqueror,
     And bring with him his beauteous paramour,
     Both in their right shapes, gesture, and attire
     They us'd to wear during their time of life,
     Thou shalt both satisfy my just desire,
     And give me cause to praise thee whilst I live.

     FAUSTUS. My gracious lord, I am ready to accomplish your request,
     so far forth as by art and power of my spirit I am able to perform.

     KNIGHT. I'faith, that's just nothing at all.
          [Aside.]

     FAUSTUS. But, if it like your grace, it is not in my ability[136]
     to present before your eyes the true substantial bodies of those
     two deceased princes, which long since are consumed to dust.

     KNIGHT. Ay, marry, Master Doctor, now there's a sign of grace in
     you, when you will confess the truth.
          [Aside.]

     FAUSTUS. But such spirits as can lively resemble Alexander and
     his paramour shall appear before your grace, in that manner that
     they both[137] lived in, in their most flourishing estate; which
     I doubt not shall sufficiently content your imperial majesty.

     EMPEROR. Go to, Master Doctor; let me see them presently.

     KNIGHT. Do you hear, Master Doctor? you bring Alexander and his
     paramour before the Emperor!

     FAUSTUS. How then, sir?

     KNIGHT. I'faith, that's as true as Diana turned me to a stag.

     FAUSTUS. No, sir; but, when Actaeon died, he left the horns for
     you.--Mephistophilis, be gone.
          [Exit MEPHISTOPHILIS.]

     KNIGHT. Nay, an you go to conjuring, I'll be gone.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. I'll meet with you anon for interrupting me so.
     --Here they are, my gracious lord.

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with SPIRITS in the shapes of ALEXANDER
          and his PARAMOUR.

     EMPEROR. Master Doctor, I heard this lady, while she lived, had a
     wart or mole in her neck:  how shall I know whether it be so or no?

     FAUSTUS. Your highness may boldly go and see.

     EMPEROR. Sure, these are no spirits, but the true substantial
     bodies of those two deceased princes.
          [Exeunt Spirits.]

     FAUSTUS. Wilt please your highness now to send for the knight
     that was so pleasant with me here of late?

     EMPEROR. One of you call him forth.
          [Exit ATTENDANT.]

          Re-enter the KNIGHT with a pair of horns on his head.

     How now, sir knight! why, I had thought thou hadst been a bachelor,
     but now I see thou hast a wife, that not only gives thee horns,
     but makes thee wear them.  Feel on thy head.

     KNIGHT. Thou damned wretch and execrable dog,
     Bred in the concave of some monstrous rock,
     How dar'st thou thus abuse a gentleman?
     Villain, I say, undo what thou hast done!

     FAUSTUS. O, not so fast, sir! there's no haste:  but, good, are
     you remembered how you crossed me in my conference with the
     Emperor?  I think I have met with you for it.

     EMPEROR. Good Master Doctor, at my entreaty release him:  he hath
     done penance sufficient.

     FAUSTUS. My gracious lord, not so much for the injury he offered
     me here in your presence, as to delight you with some mirth, hath
     Faustus worthily requited this injurious knight; which being all
     I desire, I am content to release him of his horns:--and,
     sir knight, hereafter speak well of scholars.--Mephistophilis,
     transform him straight.[138]  [MEPHISTOPHILIS removes the horns.]
     --Now, my good lord, having done my duty, I humbly take my leave.

     EMPEROR. Farewell, Master Doctor:  yet, ere you go,
     Expect from me a bounteous reward.
          [Exeunt EMPEROR, KNIGHT, and ATTENDANTS.]

     FAUSTUS. Now, Mephistophilis,[139] the restless course
     That time doth run with calm and silent foot,
     Shortening my days and thread of vital life,
     Calls for the payment of my latest years:
     Therefore, sweet Mephistophilis, let us
     Make haste to Wertenberg.

     MEPHIST. What, will you go on horse-back or on foot[?]

     FAUSTUS. Nay, till I'm past this fair and pleasant green,
     I'll walk on foot.

          Enter a HORSE-COURSER.[140]

     HORSE-COURSER. I have been all this day seeking one Master Fustian:
     mass, see where he is!--God save you, Master Doctor!

     FAUSTUS. What, horse-courser! you are well met.

     HORSE-COURSER. Do you hear, sir?  I have brought you forty dollars
     for your horse.

     FAUSTUS. I cannot sell him so:  if thou likest him for fifty, take
     him.

     HORSE-COURSER. Alas, sir, I have no more!--I pray you, speak for
     me.

     MEPHIST. I pray you, let him have him:  he is an honest fellow,
     and he has a great charge, neither wife nor child.

     FAUSTUS. Well, come, give me your money [HORSE-COURSER gives
     FAUSTUS the money]:  my boy will deliver him to you.  But I must
     tell you one thing before you have him; ride him not into the
     water, at any hand.

     HORSE-COURSER. Why, sir, will he not drink of all waters?

     FAUSTUS. O, yes, he will drink of all waters; but ride him not
     into the water:  ride him over hedge or ditch, or where thou wilt,
     but not into the water.

     HORSE-COURSER. Well, sir.--Now am I made man for ever:  I'll not
     leave my horse for forty:[141]  if he had but the quality of
     hey-ding-ding, hey-ding-ding, I'd make a brave living on him:
     he has a buttock as slick as an eel [Aside].--Well, God b'wi'ye,
     sir:  your boy will deliver him me:  but, hark you, sir; if my horse
     be sick or ill at ease, if I bring his water to you, you'll tell
     me what it is?

     FAUSTUS. Away, you villain! what, dost think I am a horse-doctor?
          [Exit HORSE-COURSER.]

     What art thou, Faustus, but a man condemn'd to die?
     Thy fatal time doth draw to final end;
     Despair doth drive distrust into[142] my thoughts:
     Confound these passions with a quiet sleep:
     Tush, Christ did call the thief upon the Cross;
     Then rest thee, Faustus, quiet in conceit.
          [Sleeps in his chair.]

          Re-enter HORSE-COURSER, all wet, crying.

     HORSE-COURSER. Alas, alas!  Doctor Fustian, quoth a? mass, Doctor
     Lopus[143] was never such a doctor:  has given me a purgation, has
     purged me of forty dollars; I shall never see them more.  But yet,
     like an ass as I was, I would not be ruled by him, for he bade me
     I should ride him into no water:  now I, thinking my horse had had
     some rare quality that he would not have had me know of,[144] I,
     like a venturous youth, rid him into the deep pond at the town's
     end.  I was no sooner in the middle of the pond, but my horse
     vanished away, and I sat upon a bottle of hay, never so near
     drowning in my life.  But I'll seek out my doctor, and have my
     forty dollars again, or I'll make it the dearest horse!--O,
     yonder is his snipper-snapper.--Do you hear? you, hey-pass,[145]
     where's your master?

     MEPHIST. Why, sir, what would you? you cannot speak with him.

     HORSE-COURSER. But I will speak with him.

     MEPHIST. Why, he's fast asleep:  come some other time.

     HORSE-COURSER. I'll speak with him now, or I'll break his
     glass-windows about his ears.

     MEPHIST. I tell thee, he has not slept this eight nights.

     HORSE-COURSER. An he have not slept this eight weeks, I'll
     speak with him.

     MEPHIST. See, where he is, fast asleep.

     HORSE-COURSER. Ay, this is he.--God save you, Master Doctor,
     Master Doctor, Master Doctor Fustian! forty dollars, forty dollars
     for a bottle of hay!

     MEPHIST. Why, thou seest he hears thee not.

     HORSE-COURSER. So-ho, ho! so-ho, ho!  [Hollows in his ear.]  No,
     will you not wake?  I'll make you wake ere I go.  [Pulls FAUSTUS
     by the leg, and pulls it away.]  Alas, I am undone! what shall
     I do?

     FAUSTUS. O, my leg, my leg!--Help, Mephistophilis! call the
     officers.--My leg, my leg!

     MEPHIST. Come, villain, to the constable.

     HORSE-COURSER. O Lord, sir, let me go, and I'll give you forty
     dollars more!

     MEPHIST. Where be they?

     HORSE-COURSER. I have none about me:  come to my ostry,[146]
     and I'll give them you.

     MEPHIST. Be gone quickly.
          [HORSE-COURSER runs away.]

     FAUSTUS. What, is he gone? farewell he!  Faustus has his leg again,
     and the Horse-courser, I take it, a bottle of hay for his labour:
     well, this trick shall cost him forty dollars more.

          Enter WAGNER.

     How now, Wagner! what's the news with thee?

     WAGNER. Sir, the Duke of Vanholt doth earnestly entreat your
     company.

     FAUSTUS. The Duke of Vanholt! an honourable gentleman, to whom
     I must be no niggard of my cunning.[147]--Come, Mephistophilis,
     let's away to him.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter the DUKE OF VANHOLT, the DUCHESS, and FAUSTUS.[148]

     DUKE. Believe me, Master Doctor, this merriment hath much pleased
     me.

     FAUSTUS. My gracious lord, I am glad it contents you so well.
     --But it may be, madam, you take no delight in this.  I have heard
     that great-bellied women do long for some dainties or other:  what
     is it, madam? tell me, and you shall have it.

     DUCHESS. Thanks, good Master Doctor:  and, for I see your courteous
     intent to pleasure me, I will not hide from you the thing my heart
     desires; and, were it now summer, as it is January and the dead
     time of the winter, I would desire no better meat than a dish
     of ripe grapes.

     FAUSTUS. Alas, madam, that's nothing!--Mephistophilis, be gone.
     [Exit MEPHISTOPHILIS.] Were it a greater thing than this, so it
     would content you, you should have it.

          Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with grapes.

     Here they be, madam:  wilt please you taste on them?

     DUKE. Believe me, Master Doctor, this makes me wonder above the
     rest, that being in the dead time of winter and in the month of
     January, how you should come by these grapes.

     FAUSTUS. If it like your grace, the year is divided into two
     circles over the whole world, that, when it is here winter with
     us, in the contrary circle it is summer with them, as in India,
     Saba,[149] and farther countries in the east; and by means of a
     swift spirit that I have, I had them brought hither, as you see.
     --How do you like them, madam? be they good?

     DUCHESS. Believe me, Master Doctor, they be the best grapes that
     e'er I tasted in my life before.

     FAUSTUS. I am glad they content you so, madam.

     DUKE. Come, madam, let us in, where you must well reward this
     learned man for the great kindness he hath shewed to you.

     DUCHESS. And so I will, my lord; and, whilst I live, rest
     beholding[150] for this courtesy.

     FAUSTUS. I humbly thank your grace.

     DUKE. Come, Master Doctor, follow us, and receive your reward.
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter WAGNER.[151]

     WAGNER. I think my master means to die shortly,
     For he hath given to me all his goods:[152]
     And yet, methinks, if that death were near,
     He would not banquet, and carouse, and swill
     Amongst the students, as even now he doth,
     Who are at supper with such belly-cheer
     As Wagner ne'er beheld in all his life.
     See, where they come! belike the feast is ended.
          [Exit.]

          Enter FAUSTUS with two or three SCHOLARS, and MEPHISTOPHILIS.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Master Doctor Faustus, since our conference about
     fair ladies, which was the beautifulest in all the world, we have
     determined with ourselves that Helen of Greece was the admirablest
     lady that ever lived:  therefore, Master Doctor, if you will do us
     that favour, as to let us see that peerless dame of Greece, whom
     all the world admires for majesty, we should think ourselves much
     beholding unto you.

     FAUSTUS. Gentlemen,
     For that I know your friendship is unfeign'd,
     And Faustus' custom is not to deny
     The just requests of those that wish him well,
     You shall behold that peerless dame of Greece,
     No otherways for pomp and majesty
     Than when Sir Paris cross'd the seas with her,
     And brought the spoils to rich Dardania.
     Be silent, then, for danger is in words.
          [Music sounds, and HELEN passeth over the stage.[153]]

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Too simple is my wit to tell her praise,
     Whom all the world admires for majesty.

     THIRD SCHOLAR. No marvel though the angry Greeks pursu'd
     With ten years' war the rape of such a queen,
     Whose heavenly beauty passeth all compare.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Since we have seen the pride of Nature's works,
     And only paragon of excellence,
     Let us depart; and for this glorious deed
     Happy and blest be Faustus evermore!

     FAUSTUS. Gentlemen, farewell:  the same I wish to you.
          [Exeunt SCHOLARS.]

          Enter an OLD MAN.[154]

     OLD MAN. Ah, Doctor Faustus, that I might prevail
     To guide thy steps unto the way of life,
     By which sweet path thou mayst attain the goal
     That shall conduct thee to celestial rest!
     Break heart, drop blood, and mingle it with tears,
     Tears falling from repentant heaviness
     Of thy most vile[155] and loathsome filthiness,
     The stench whereof corrupts the inward soul
     With such flagitious crimes of heinous sin[156]
     As no commiseration may expel,
     But mercy, Faustus, of thy Saviour sweet,
     Whose blood alone must wash away thy guilt.

     FAUSTUS. Where art thou, Faustus? wretch, what hast thou done?
     Damn'd art thou, Faustus, damn'd; despair and die!
     Hell calls for right, and with a roaring voice
     Says, "Faustus, come; thine hour is almost[157] come;"
     And Faustus now[158] will come to do thee right.
          [MEPHISTOPHILIS gives him a dagger.]

     OLD MAN. Ah, stay, good Faustus, stay thy desperate steps!
     I see an angel hovers o'er thy head,
     And, with a vial full of precious grace,
     Offers to pour the same into thy soul:
     Then call for mercy, and avoid despair.

     FAUSTUS. Ah, my sweet friend, I feel
     Thy words to comfort my distressed soul!
     Leave me a while to ponder on my sins.

     OLD MAN. I go, sweet Faustus; but with heavy cheer,
     Fearing the ruin of thy hopeless soul.
          [Exit.]

     FAUSTUS. Accursed Faustus, where is mercy now?
     I do repent; and yet I do despair:
     Hell strives with grace for conquest in my breast:
     What shall I do to shun the snares of death?

     MEPHIST. Thou traitor, Faustus, I arrest thy soul
     For disobedience to my sovereign lord:
     Revolt, or I'll in piece-meal tear thy flesh.

     FAUSTUS. Sweet Mephistophilis, entreat thy lord
     To pardon my unjust presumption,
     And with my blood again I will confirm
     My former vow I made to Lucifer.

     MEPHIST. Do it, then, quickly,[159] with unfeigned heart,
     Lest greater danger do attend thy drift.

     FAUSTUS. Torment, sweet friend, that base and crooked age,
     That durst dissuade me from thy Lucifer,
     With greatest torments that our hell affords.

     MEPHIST. His faith is great; I cannot touch his soul;
     But what I may afflict his body with
     I will attempt, which is but little worth.

     FAUSTUS. One thing, good servant,[160] let me crave of thee,
     To glut the longing of my heart's desire,--
     That I might have unto my paramour
     That heavenly Helen which I saw of late,
     Whose sweet embracings may extinguish clean
     Those[161] thoughts that do dissuade me from my vow,
     And keep mine oath I made to Lucifer.

     MEPHIST. Faustus, this,[162] or what else thou shalt desire,
     Shall be perform'd in twinkling of an eye.

          Re-enter HELEN.

     FAUSTUS. Was this the face that launch'd a thousand ships,
     And burnt the topless[163] towers of Ilium--
     Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss.--
          [Kisses her.]
     Her lips suck forth my soul:  see, where it flies!--
     Come, Helen, come, give me my soul again.
     Here will I dwell, for heaven is[164] in these lips,
     And all is dross that is not Helena.
     I will be Paris, and for love of thee,
     Instead of Troy, shall Wertenberg be sack'd;
     And I will combat with weak Menelaus,
     And wear thy colours on my plumed crest;
     Yea, I will wound Achilles in the heel,
     And then return to Helen for a kiss.
     O, thou art fairer than the evening air
     Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars;
     Brighter art thou than flaming Jupiter
     When he appear'd to hapless Semele;
     More lovely than the monarch of the sky
     In wanton Arethusa's azur'd arms;
     And none but thou shalt[165] be my paramour!
          [Exeunt.]

          Enter the OLD MAN.[166]

     OLD MAN. Accursed Faustus, miserable man,
     That from thy soul exclud'st the grace of heaven,
     And fly'st the throne of his tribunal-seat!

          Enter DEVILS.

     Satan begins to sift me with his pride:
     As in this furnace God shall try my faith,
     My faith, vile hell, shall triumph over thee.
     Ambitious fiends, see how the heavens smile
     At your repulse, and laugh your state to scorn!
     Hence, hell! for hence I fly unto my God.
          [Exeunt,--on one side, DEVILS, on the other, OLD MAN.]

          Enter FAUSTUS,[167] with SCHOLARS.

     FAUSTUS. Ah, gentlemen!

     FIRST SCHOLAR. What ails Faustus?

     FAUSTUS. Ah, my sweet chamber-fellow, had I lived with thee,
     then had I lived still! but now I die eternally.  Look, comes
     he not? comes he not?

     SECOND SCHOLAR. What means Faustus?

     THIRD SCHOLAR. Belike he is grown into some sickness by being
     over-solitary.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. If it be so, we'll have physicians to cure him.
     --'Tis but a surfeit; never fear, man.

     FAUSTUS. A surfeit of deadly sin, that hath damned both body
     and soul.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Yet, Faustus, look up to heaven; remember God's
     mercies are infinite.

     FAUSTUS. But Faustus' offence can ne'er be pardoned:  the serpent
     that tempted Eve may be saved, but not Faustus.  Ah, gentlemen,
     hear me with patience, and tremble not at my speeches!  Though
     my heart pants and quivers to remember that I have been a student
     here these thirty years, O, would I had never seen Wertenberg,
     never read book! and what wonders I have done, all Germany can
     witness, yea, all the world; for which Faustus hath lost both
     Germany and the world, yea, heaven itself, heaven, the seat of
     God, the throne of the blessed, the kingdom of joy; and must
     remain in hell for ever, hell, ah, hell, for ever!  Sweet friends,
     what shall become of Faustus, being in hell for ever?

     THIRD SCHOLAR. Yet, Faustus, call on God.

     FAUSTUS. On God, whom Faustus hath abjured! on God, whom Faustus
     hath blasphemed!  Ah, my God, I would weep! but the devil draws in
     my tears.  Gush forth blood, instead of tears! yea, life and soul!
     O, he stays my tongue!  I would lift up my hands; but see, they
     hold them, they hold them!

     ALL. Who, Faustus?

     FAUSTUS. Lucifer and Mephistophilis.  Ah, gentlemen, I gave them
     my soul for my cunning![168]

     ALL. God forbid!

     FAUSTUS. God forbade it, indeed; but Faustus hath done it:  for
     vain pleasure of twenty-four years hath Faustus lost eternal joy
     and felicity.  I writ them a bill with mine own blood:  the date
     is expired; the time will come, and he will fetch me.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Why did not Faustus tell us of this before,[169]
     that divines might have prayed for thee?

     FAUSTUS. Oft have I thought to have done so; but the devil
     threatened to tear me in pieces, if I named God, to fetch both
     body and soul, if I once gave ear to divinity:  and now 'tis too
     late.  Gentlemen, away, lest you perish with me.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. O, what shall we do to save[170] Faustus?

     FAUSTUS. Talk not of me, but save yourselves, and depart.

     THIRD SCHOLAR. God will strengthen me; I will stay with Faustus.

     FIRST SCHOLAR. Tempt not God, sweet friend; but let us into the
     next room, and there pray for him.

     FAUSTUS. Ay, pray for me, pray for me; and what noise soever
     ye hear,[171] come not unto me, for nothing can rescue me.

     SECOND SCHOLAR. Pray thou, and we will pray that God may have
     mercy upon thee.

     FAUSTUS. Gentlemen, farewell:  if I live till morning, I'll visit
     you; if not, Faustus is gone to hell.

     ALL. Faustus, farewell.
          [Exeunt SCHOLARS.--The clock strikes eleven.]

     FAUSTUS. Ah, Faustus,
     Now hast thou but one bare hour to live,
     And then thou must be damn'd perpetually!
     Stand still, you ever-moving spheres of heaven,
     That time may cease, and midnight never come;
     Fair Nature's eye, rise, rise again, and make
     Perpetual day; or let this hour be but
     A year, a month, a week, a natural day,
     That Faustus may repent and save his soul!
     O lente,[172] lente currite, noctis equi!
     The stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike,
     The devil will come, and Faustus must be damn'd.
     O, I'll leap up to my God!--Who pulls me down?--
     See, see, where Christ's blood streams in the firmament!
     One drop would save my soul, half a drop:  ah, my Christ!--
     Ah, rend not my heart for naming of my Christ!
     Yet will I call on him:  O, spare me, Lucifer!--
     Where is it now? 'tis gone:  and see, where God
     Stretcheth out his arm, and bends his ireful brows!
     Mountains and hills, come, come, and fall on me,
     And hide me from the heavy wrath of God!
     No, no!
     Then will I headlong run into the earth:
     Earth, gape!  O, no, it will not harbour me!
     You stars that reign'd at my nativity,
     Whose influence hath allotted death and hell,
     Now draw up Faustus, like a foggy mist.
     Into the entrails of yon labouring cloud[s],
     That, when you[173] vomit forth into the air,
     My limbs may issue from your smoky mouths,
     So that my soul may but ascend to heaven!
          [The clock strikes the half-hour.]
     Ah, half the hour is past! 'twill all be past anon
     O God,
     If thou wilt not have mercy on my soul,
     Yet for Christ's sake, whose blood hath ransom'd me,
     Impose some end to my incessant pain;
     Let Faustus live in hell a thousand years,
     A hundred thousand, and at last be sav'd!
     O, no end is limited to damned souls!
     Why wert thou not a creature wanting soul?
     Or why is this immortal that thou hast?
     Ah, Pythagoras' metempsychosis, were that true,
     This soul should fly from me, and I be chang'd
     Unto some brutish beast![174] all beasts are happy,
     For, when they die,
     Their souls are soon dissolv'd in elements;
     But mine must live still to be plagu'd in hell.
     Curs'd be the parents that engender'd me!
     No, Faustus, curse thyself, curse Lucifer
     That hath depriv'd thee of the joys of heaven.
          [The clock strikes twelve.]
     O, it strikes, it strikes!  Now, body, turn to air,
     Or Lucifer will bear thee quick to hell!
          [Thunder and lightning.]
     O soul, be chang'd into little water-drops,
     And fall into the ocean, ne'er be found!

          Enter DEVILS.

     My God, my god, look not so fierce on me!
     Adders and serpents, let me breathe a while!
     Ugly hell, gape not! come not, Lucifer!
     I'll burn my books!--Ah, Mephistophilis!
          [Exeunt DEVILS with FAUSTUS.]  [175]

          Enter CHORUS.

     CHORUS. Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight,
     And burned is Apollo's laurel-bough,
     That sometime grew within this learned man.
     Faustus is gone:  regard his hellish fall,
     Whose fiendful fortune may exhort the wise,
     Only to wonder at unlawful things,
     Whose deepness doth entice such forward wits
     To practice more than heavenly power permits.
          [Exit.]

of Antwerp by the Prince of Parma in 1585, "They of Antuerpe
knowing that the bridge and the Stocadoes were finished,
made a great shippe, to be a meanes to breake all this worke
of the prince of Parmaes:  this great shippe was made of masons
worke within, in the manner of a vaulted caue:  vpon the hatches
there were layed myll-stones, graue-stones, and others of great
weight; and within the vault were many barrels of powder, ouer
the which there were holes, and in them they had put matches,
hanging at a thred, the which burning vntill they came vnto
the thred, would fall into the powder, and so blow vp all.
And for that they could not haue any one in this shippe to
conduct it, Lanckhaer, a sea captaine of the Hollanders, being
then in Antuerpe, gaue them counsell to tye a great beame at the
end of it, to make it to keepe a straight course in the middest
of the streame.  In this sort floated this shippe the fourth of
Aprill, vntill that it came vnto the bridge; where (within a
while after) the powder wrought his effect, with such violence,
as the vessell, and all that was within it, and vpon it, flew in
pieces, carrying away a part of the Stocado and of the bridge.
The marquesse of Roubay Vicont of Gant, Gaspar of Robles lord of
Billy, and the Seignior of Torchies, brother vnto the Seignior
of Bours, with many others, were presently slaine; which were

TUMERARIS," Mr. J. Crossley, of Manchester, would read (rejecting
the word "Dragon") "quod TU MANDARES" (the construction being
"quod tu mandares ut Mephistophilis appareat et surgat"):  but the

Mephistophilis in "a thicke wood neere to Wittenberg, called
in the German tongue Spisser Wolt.....  Presently, not three
fathom above his head, fell a flame in manner of a lightning,
and changed itselfe into a globe.....  Suddenly the globe opened,
and sprung up in the height of a man; so burning a time, in the
end it converted to the shape of a fiery man[?-- This pleasant
beast ran about the circle a great while, and, lastly, appeared
in the manner of a Gray Fryer, asking Faustus what was his
request?" Sigs. A 2, A 3, ed. 1648.  Again; "After Doctor Faustus
had made his promise to the devill, in the morning betimes he
called the spirit before him, and commanded him that he should
alwayes come to him like a fryer after the order of Saint Francis,
with a bell in his hand like Saint Anthony, and to ring it once

[Footnote 87: me-- So the later 4tos.--2to 1604 "thee."]

[Footnote 88: he desires-- Not in any of the four 4tos.  In the tract
just cited, the "3d Article" stands thus,--"That Mephostophiles
should bring him any thing, and doe for him whatsoever."  Sig. A 4,
ed. 1648.  A later ed. adds "he desired."  Marlowe, no doubt,
followed some edition of the HISTORY in which these words,
or something equivalent to them, had been omitted by mistake.
(2to 1661, which I consider as of no authority, has "he
requireth.")]

[Footnote 94: What! walking, disputing, &c.-- The later 4tos have "What,
SLEEPING, EATING, walking, AND disputing!" But it is evident
that this speech is not given correctly in any of the old eds.]

[Footnote 95: let me have a wife, &c.-- The ninth chapter of THE HISTORY
OF DR. FAUSTUS narrates "How Doctor Faustus would have married,
and how the Devill had almost killed him for it," and concludes
as follows.  "It is no jesting [said Mephistophilis-- with us:
hold thou that which thou hast vowed, and we will peforme as we
have promised; and more shall that, thou shalt have thy hearts
desire of what woman soever thou wilt, be she alive or dead,
and so long as thou wilt thou shalt keep her by thee.--These
words pleased Faustus wonderfull well, and repented himself that
he was so foolish to wish himselfe married, that might have any
woman in the whole city brought him at his command; the which
he practised and persevered in a long time."  Sig. B 3, ed. 1648.]

     lines which are defective in the first syllable; and in some
     of these instances at least it would almost seem that nothing
     has been omitted by the transcriber or printer.--]

[Footnote 105: Enter the SEVEN DEADLY SINS-- In THE HISTORY OF DR. FAUSTUS,
Lucifer amuses Faustus, not by calling up the Seven Deadly Sins,
but by making various devils appear before him, "one after another,
in forme as they were in hell."  "First entered Beliall in forme
of a beare," &c.--"after him came Beelzebub, in curled haire of
a horseflesh colour," &c.--"then came Astaroth, in the forme of
a worme," &c. &c.  During this exhibition, "Lucifer himselfe sate
in manner of a man all hairy, but of browne colour, like a
squirrell, curled, and his tayle turning upward on his backe as
the squirrels use:  I think he could crack nuts too like a
squirrell."  Sig. D, ed. 1648.]

on a line by themselves, without a prefix.  (In the later 4tos,
the corresponding passage is as follows;
    "------ begins with Lechery.

     LUCIFER. Away to hell, away!  On, piper!  [Exeunt the SINS.
     FAUSTUS. O, how this sight doth delight my soul!" &c.)]

and hence the error.]

OF DR. FAUSTUS; "He came from Paris to Mentz, where the river
of Maine falls into the Rhine:  notwithstanding he tarried not
long there, but went into Campania, in the kingdome of Neapol,
in which he saw an innumerable sort of cloysters, nunries, and
churches, and great houses of stone, the streets faire and large,
and straight forth from one end of the towne to the other as a
line; and all the pavement of the city was of bricke, and the
more it rained into the towne, the fairer the streets were:
there saw he the tombe of Virgill, and the highway that he cu[t]
through the mighty hill of stone in one night, the whole length
of an English mile," &c. Sig. E 2, ed. 1648.]

[Footnote 116: The way he cut, &c.-- During the middle ages Virgil was
regarded as a great magician, and much was written concerning
his exploits in that capacity.  The LYFE OF VIRGILIUS, however,
(see Thoms's EARLY PROSE ROMANCES, vol. ii.,) makes no mention
of the feat in question.  But Petrarch speaks of it as follows.
"Non longe a Puteolis Falernus collis attollitur, famoso palmite
nobilis.  Inter Falernum et mare mons est saxeus, hominum manibus
confossus, quod vulgus insulsum a Virgilio magicis cantaminibus
factum putant:  ita clarorum fama hominum, non veris contenta
laudibus, saepe etiam fabulis viam facit.  De quo cum me olim
Robertus regno clarus, sed praeclarus ingenio ac literis, quid
sentirem, multis astantibus, percunctatus esset, humanitate fretus
regia, qua non reges modo sed homines vicit, jocans nusquam me
legisse magicarium fuisse Virgilium respondi:  quod ille severissimae
nutu frontis approbans, non illic magici sed ferri vestigia
confessus est.  Sunt autem fauces excavati montis angustae sed
longissimae atque atrae:  tenebrosa inter horrifica semper nox:
publicum iter in medio, mirum et religioni proximum, belli quoque
immolatum temporibus, sic vero populi vox est, et nullis unquam
latrociniis attentatum, patet:  Criptam Neapolitanam dicunt, cujus
et in epistolis ad Lucilium Seneca mentionem fecit.  Sub finem fusci
tramitis, ubi primo videri coelum incipit, in aggere edito, ipsius
Virgilii busta visuntur, pervetusti operis, unde haec forsan ab
illo perforati montis fluxit opinio."  ITINERARIUM SYRIACUM,--OPP.

[Footnote 136: But, if it like your grace, it is not in my ability, &c.]
"D. Faustus answered, My most excellent lord, I am ready to
accomplish your request in all things, so farre forth as I and
my spirit are able to performe:  yet your majesty shall know that
their dead bodies are not able substantially to be brought before
you; but such spirits as have seene Alexander and his Paramour
alive shall appeare unto you, in manner and form as they both
lived in their most flourishing time; and herewith I hope to
please your Imperiall Majesty.  Then Faustus went a little aside
to speake to his spirit; but he returned againe presently, saying,
Now, if it please your Majesty, you shall see them; yet, upon this
condition, that you demand no question of them, nor speake unto
them; which the Emperor agreed unto.  Wherewith Doctor Faustus opened
the privy-chamber doore, where presently entered the great and mighty
emperor Alexander Magnus, in all things to looke upon as if he
had beene alive; in proportion, a strong set thicke man, of a
middle stature, blacke haire, and that both thicke and curled,
head and beard, red cheekes, and a broad face, with eyes like
a basiliske; he had a compleat harnesse (i.e. suit of armour)
burnished and graven, exceeding rich to look upon:  and so,
passing towards the Emperor Carolus, he made low and reverend
courtesie:  whereat the Emperour Carolus would have stood up to
receive and greet him with the like reverence; but Faustus tooke
hold on him, and would not permit him to doe it.  Shortly after,
Alexander made humble reverence, and went out againe; and comming
to the doore, his paramour met him.  She comming in made the Emperour
likewise reverence:  she was cloathed in blew velvet, wrought and
imbroidered with pearls and gold; she was also excellent faire,
like milke and blood mixed, tall and slender, with a face round
as an apple.  And thus passed [she-- certaine times up and downe
the house; which the Emperor marking, said to himselfe, Now have
I seene two persons which my heart hath long wished to behold;
and sure it cannot otherwise be (said he to himselfe) but that
the spirits have changed themselves into these formes, and have
but deceived me, calling to minde the woman that raised the prophet
Samuel:  and for that the Emperor would be the more satisfied in
the matter, he said, I have often heard that behind, in her neck,
she had a great wart or wen; wherefore he tooke Faustus by the
hand without any words, and went to see if it were also to be
seene on her or not; but she, perceiving that he came to her,
bowed downe her neck, when he saw a great wart; and hereupon she
vanished, leaving the Emperor and the rest well contented."

[Footnote 137: both-- Old ed. "best."]

[Footnote 138: Mephistophilis, transform him straight-- According to THE
HISTORY OF DR. FAUSTUS, the knight was not present during Faustus's
"conference" with the Emperor; nor did he offer the doctor any
insult by doubting his skill in magic.  We are there told that
Faustus happening to see the knight asleep, "leaning out of a
window of the great hall," fixed a huge pair of hart's horns on
his head; "and, as the knight awaked, thinking to pull in his head,
he hit his hornes against the glasse, that the panes thereof flew
about his eares:  thinke here how this good gentleman was vexed,
for he could neither get backward nor forward."  After the emperor
and the courtiers, to their great amusement, had beheld the poor
knight in this condition, Faustus removed the horns.  When Faustus,
having taken leave of the emperor, was a league and a half from
the city, he was attacked in a wood by the knight and some of his
companions:  they were in armour, and mounted on fair palfreys;
but the doctor quickly overcame them by turning all the bushes
into horsemen, and "so charmed them, that every one, knight and
other, for the space of a whole moneth, did weare a paire of
goates hornes on their browes, and every palfry a paire of oxe
hornes on his head; and this was their penance appointed by
Faustus."  A second attempt of the knight to revenge himself on
Faustus proved equally unsuccessful.  Sigs. G 2, I 3, ed. 1648.]

to be changed to the "fair and pleasant green" which Faustus
presently mentions.]

chapter (the 34th) of THE HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS:  "After this

In the later 4tos a scene intervenes between the "Exeunt" of
Faustus, Mephistophilis, and Wagner, and the entrance of the Duke
of Vanholt, &c.--We are to suppose that Faustus is now at the court
of the Duke of Vanholt:  this is plain, not only from the later 4tos,
--in which Wagner tells Faustus that the Duke "hath sent some of
his men to attend him, with provision fit for his journey,"--but
from THE HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS, the subjoined portion of which
is closely followed in the present scene.  "Chap. xxxix. HOW DOCTOR
FAUSTUS PLAYED A MERRY JEST WITH THE DUKE OF ANHOLT IN HIS COURT.
Doctor Faustus on a time went to the Duke of Anholt, who welcommed
him very courteously; this was the moneth of January; where sitting
at the table, he perceived the dutchess to be with child; and
forbearing himselfe untill the meat was taken from the table,
and that they brought in the banqueting dishes [i.e. the dessert--,
Doctor Faustus said to the dutchesse, Gratious lady, I have alwayes
heard that great-bellied women doe alwayes long for some dainties;
I beseech therefore your grace, hide not your minde from me, but
tell me what you desire to eat.  She answered him, Doctor Faustus,
now truly I will not hide from you what my heart doth most desire;
namely, that, if it were now harvest, I would eat my bellyfull of
grapes and other dainty fruit.  Doctor Faustus answered hereupon,
Gracious lady, this is a small thing for me to doe, for I can doe
more than this.  Wherefore he tooke a plate, and set open one of
the casements of the window, holding it forth; where incontinent
he had his dish full of all manner of fruit, as red and white
grapes, peares, and apples, the which came from out of strange
countries:  all these he presented the dutchesse, saying, Madam,
I pray you vouchsafe to taste of this dainty fruit, the which
came from a farre countrey, for there the summer is not yet ended.
The dutchesse thanked Faustus highly, and she fell to her fruit
with full appetite.  The Duke of Anholt notwithstanding could not
withhold to ask Faustus with what reason there were such young
fruit to be had at that time of the yeare.  Doctor Faustus told
him, May it please your grace to understand that the year is
divided into two circles of the whole world, that when with us it
is winter, in the contrary circle it is notwithstanding summer;
for in India and Saba there falleth or setteth the sunne, so that
it is so warm that they have twice a yeare fruit; and, gracious
lord, I have a swift spirit, the which can in the twinkling of
an eye fulfill my desire in any thing; wherefore I sent him into
those countries, who hath brought this fruit as you see:  whereat
the duke was in great admiration."]

[Footnote 153: HELEN passeth over the stage-- In THE HISTORY OF DOCTOR
FAUSTUS we have the following description of Helen.  "This lady
appeared before them in a most rich gowne of purple velvet, costly
imbrodered; her haire hanged downe loose, as faire as the beaten
gold, and of such length that it reached downe to her hammes;
having most amorous cole-black eyes, a sweet and pleasant round
face, with lips as red as a cherry; her cheekes of a rose colour,
her mouth small, her neck white like a swan; tall and slender of
personage; in summe, there was no imperfect place in her:  she
looked round about with a rolling hawkes eye, a smiling and
wanton countenance, which neere-hand inflamed the hearts of all
the students; but that they perswaded themselves she was a spirit,
which made them lightly passe away such fancies."  Sig. H 4, ed. 1648.]

FAUSTUS,--"How an old man, the neighbour of Faustus, sought to

wrote the second time with his owne blood, and gave it to the
Devill."]

[Footnote 160: One thing, good servant, &c.-- "To the end that this miserable
Faustus might fill the lust of his flesh and live in all manner
of voluptuous pleasure, it came in his mind, after he had slept
his first sleepe, and in the 23 year past of his time, that he
had a great desire to lye with faire Helena of Greece, especially
her whom he had seen and shewed unto the students at Wittenberg:
wherefore he called unto his spirit Mephostophiles, commanding him
to bring to him the faire Helena; which he also did.  Whereupon he
fell in love with her, and made her his common concubine and
bed-fellow; for she was so beautifull and delightfull a peece,
that he could not be one houre from her, if he should therefore
have suffered death, she had so stoln away his heart:  and, to
his seeming, in time she was with childe, whom Faustus named
Justus Faustus.  The childe told Doctor Faustus many things which
were don in forraign countrys; but in the end, when Faustus lost
his life, the mother and the childe vanished away both together."

[Footnote 166: Enter the OLD MAN-- Scene, a room in the Old Man's house.
--In THE HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS the Old Man makes himself very
merry with the attempts of the evil powers to hurt him.  "About
two dayes after that he had exhorted Faustus, as the poore man
lay in his bed, suddenly there was a mighty rumbling in the
chamber, the which he was never wont to heare, and he heard as
it had beene the groaning of a sow, which lasted long:  whereupon
the good old man began to jest and mocke, and said, Oh, what a
barbarian cry is this?  Oh faire bird, what foul musicke is this?
A[h--, faire angell, that could not tarry two dayes in his place!
beginnest thou now to runne into a poore mans house, where thou

to conceale this matter so long from us?  We would, by the helpe
of good divines and the grace of God, have brought you out of this
net, and have torne you out of the bondage and chaines of Satan;
whereas now we feare it is too late, to the utter ruine both of
your body and soule.  Doctor Faustus answered, I durst never doe
it, although I often minded to settle my life [myself?-- to godly
people to desire counsell and helpe; and once mine old neighbour
counselled me that I should follow his learning and leave all my
conjurations:  yet, when I was minded to amend and to follow that
good mans counsell, then came the Devill and would have had me

[Footnote 175: Exeunt DEVILS with FAUSTUS-- In THE HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS,
his "miserable and lamentable end" is described as follows:  it
took place, we are informed, at "the village called Rimlich,
halfe a mile from Wittenberg."--"The students and the other that
were there, when they had prayed for him, they wept, and so went
forth; but Faustus tarried in the hall; and when the gentlemen
were laid in bed, none of them could sleepe, for that they att[e--nded
to heare if they might be privy of his end.  It happened that
betweene twelve and one a clocke at midnight, there blew a mighty
storme of winde against the house, as though it would have blowne
the foundation thereof out of his place.  Hereupon the students
began to feare and goe out of their beds, comforting one another;
but they would not stirre out of the chamber; and the host of
the house ran out of doores, thinking the house would fall.  The
students lay neere unto the hall wherein Doctor Faustus lay, and
they heard a mighty noyse and hissing, as if the hall had beene
full of snakes and adders.  With that, the hall-doore flew open,
wherein Doctor Faustus was, that he began to cry for helpe,
saying, Murther, murther! but it came forth with halfe a voyce,
hollowly:  shortly after, they heard him no more.  But when it was
day, the students, that had taken no rest that night, arose and
went into the hall, in the which they left Doctor Faustus; where
notwithstanding they found not Faustus, but all the hall lay
sprinkled with blood, his braines cleaving to the wall, for the
devill had beaten him from one wall against another; in one corner
lay his eyes, in another his teeth; a pittifull and fearefull
sight to behold.  Then began the students to waile and weepe for
him, and sought for his body in many places.  Lastly, they came
into the yard, where they found his body lying on the horse-dung,
most monstrously torne and fearefull to behold, for his head and
all his joynts were dashed in peeces.  The fore-named students and
masters that were at his death, have obtained so much, that they
buried him in the village where he was so grievously tormented.
After the which they returned to Wittenberg; and comming into the
house of Faustus, they found the servant of Faustus very sad,
unto whom they opened all the matter, who tooke it exceeding
heavily.  There found they also this history of Doctor Faustus
noted and of him written, as is before declared, all save only
his end, the which was after by the students thereto annexed;
further, what his servant had noted thereof, was made in another
booke.  And you have heard that he held by him in his life the
spirit of faire Helena, the which had by him one sonne, the which
he named Justus Faustus:  even the same day of his death they
vanished away, both mother and sonne.  The house before was so
darke that scarce any body could abide therein.  The same night
Doctor Faustus appeared unto his servant lively, and shewed unto
him many secret things, the which he had done and hidden in his
lifetime.  Likewise there were certaine which saw Doctor Faustus
looke out of the window by night, as they passed by the house."
