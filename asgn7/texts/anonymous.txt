THE STORY OF THE VOLSUNGS, (VOLSUNGA SAGA)

WITH EXCERPTS FROM THE POETIC EDDA

By Anonymous



Originally written in Icelandic (Old Norse) in the thirteenth century
A.D., by an unknown hand. However, most of the material is based
substantially on previous works, some centuries older. A few of these
works have been preserved in the collection of Norse poetry known as the
"Poetic Edda".

The text of this edition is based on that published as "The Story of
the Volsungs", translated by William Morris and Eirikr Magnusson (Walter
Scott Press, London, 1888).

INTRODUCTION

It would seem fitting for a Northern folk, deriving the greater and
better part of their speech, laws, and customs from a Northern root,
that the North should be to them, if not a holy land, yet at least
a place more to be regarded than any part of the world beside; that
howsoever their knowledge widened of other men, the faith and deeds of
their forefathers would never lack interest for them, but would always
be kept in remembrance. One cause after another has, however, aided
in turning attention to classic men and lands at the cost of our own
history. Among battles, "every schoolboy" knows the story of Marathon
or Salamis, while it would be hard indeed to find one who did more than
recognise the name, if even that, of the great fights of Hafrsfirth or
Sticklestead. The language and history of Greece and Rome, their laws
and religions, have been always held part of the learning needful to an
educated man, but no trouble has been taken to make him familiar with
his own people or their tongue. Even that Englishman who knew Alfred,
Bede, Caedmon, as well as he knew Plato, Caesar, Cicero, or Pericles,
would be hard bestead were he asked about the great peoples from whom
we sprang; the warring of Harold Fairhair or Saint Olaf; the Viking
(1) kingdoms in these (the British) Western Isles; the settlement of
Iceland, or even of Normandy. The knowledge of all these things would
now be even smaller than it is among us were it not that there was one
land left where the olden learning found refuge and was kept in being.
In England, Germany, and the rest of Europe, what is left of the
traditions of pagan times has been altered in a thousand ways by foreign
influence, even as the peoples and their speech have been by the influx
of foreign blood; but Iceland held to the old tongue that was once the
universal speech of northern folk, and held also the great stores of
tale and poem that are slowly becoming once more the common heritage of
their descendants. The truth, care, and literary beauty of its records;
the varied and strong life shown alike in tale and history; and the
preservation of the old speech, character, and tradition--a people
placed apart as the Icelanders have been--combine to make valuable what
Iceland holds for us. Not before 1770, when Bishop Percy translated
Mallet's "Northern Antiquities", was anything known here of Icelandic,
or its literature. Only within the latter part of this century has it
been studied, and in the brief book-list at the end of this volume may
be seen the little that has been done as yet. It is, however, becoming
ever clearer, and to an increasing number, how supremely important is
Icelandic as a word-hoard to the English-speaking peoples, and that in
its legend, song, and story there is a very mine of noble and pleasant
beauty and high manhood. That which has been done, one may hope, is but
the beginning of a great new birth, that shall give back to our language
and literature all that heedlessness and ignorance bid fair for awhile
to destroy.

The Scando-Gothic peoples who poured southward and westward over
Europe, to shake empires and found kingdoms, to meet Greek and Roman
in conflict, and levy tribute everywhere, had kept up their
constantly-recruited waves of incursion, until they had raised a barrier
of their own blood. It was their own kin, the sons of earlier
invaders, who stayed the landward march of the Northmen in the time of
Charlemagne. To the Southlands their road by land was henceforth closed.
Then begins the day of the Vikings, who, for two hundred years and more,
"held the world at ransom." Under many and brave leaders they first
of all came round the "Western Isles" (2) toward the end of the eighth
century; soon after they invaded Normandy, and harried the coasts of
France; gradually they lengthened their voyages until there was no shore
of the then known world upon which they were unseen or unfelt. A glance
at English history will show the large part of it they fill, and how
they took tribute from the Anglo-Saxons, who, by the way, were far
nearer kin to them than is usually thought. In Ireland, where the old
civilisation was falling to pieces, they founded kingdoms at Limerick
and Dublin among other places; (3) the last named, of which the first
king, Olaf the White, was traditionally descended of Sigurd the Volsung,
(4) endured even to the English invasion, when it was taken by men of
the same Viking blood a little altered. What effect they produced
upon the natives may be seen from the description given by the unknown
historian of the "Wars of the Gaedhil with the Gaill": "In a word,
although there were an hundred hard-steeled iron heads on one neck,
and an hundred sharp, ready, cool, never-rusting brazen tongues in each
head, and an hundred garrulous, loud, unceasing voices from each tongue,
they could not recount, or narrate, or enumerate, or tell what all the
Gaedhil suffered in common--both men and women, laity and clergy,
old and young, noble and ignoble--of hardship, and of injury, and of
oppression, in every house, from these valiant, wrathful, purely pagan
people. Even though great were this cruelty, oppression, and tyranny,
though numerous were the oft-victorious clans of the many-familied
Erinn; though numerous their kings, and their royal chiefs, and their
princes; though numerous their heroes and champions, and their brave
soldiers, their chiefs of valour and renown and deeds of arms; yet not
one of them was able to give relief, alleviation, or deliverance from
that oppression and tyranny, from the numbers and multitudes, and
the cruelty and the wrath of the brutal, ferocious, furious, untamed,
implacable hordes by whom that oppression was inflicted, because of the
excellence of their polished, ample, treble, heavy, trusty, glittering
corslets; and their hard, strong, valiant swords; and their well-riveted
long spears, and their ready, brilliant arms of valour besides; and
because of the greatness of their achievements and of their deeds, their
bravery, and their valour, their strength, and their venom, and their
ferocity, and because of the excess of their thirst and their hunger for
the brave, fruitful, nobly-inhabited, full of cataracts, rivers, bays,
pure, smooth-plained, sweet grassy land of Erinn"--(pp. 52-53). Some
part of this, however, must be abated, because the chronicler is
exalting the terror-striking enemy that he may still further exalt his
own people, the Dal Cais, who did so much under Brian Boroimhe to check
the inroads of the Northmen. When a book does (5) appear, which has
been announced these ten years past, we shall have more material for
the reconstruction of the life of those times than is now anywhere
accessible. Viking earldoms also were the Orkneys, Faroes, and
Shetlands. So late as 1171, in the reign of Henry II., the year after
Beckett's murder, Earl Sweyn Asleifsson of Orkney, who had long been the
terror of the western seas, "fared a sea-roving" and scoured the western
coast of England, Man, and the east of Ireland, but was killed in an
attack on his kinsmen of Dublin. He had used to go upon a regular plan
that may be taken as typical of the homely manner of most of his like
in their cruising: "Sweyn had in the spring hard work, and made them
lay down very much seed, and looked much after it himself. But when
that toil was ended, he fared away every spring on a viking-voyage, and
harried about among the southern isles and Ireland, and came home after
midsummer. That he called spring-viking. Then he was at home until the
corn-fields were reaped down, and the grain seen to and stored. Then
he fared away on a viking-voyage, and then he did not come home till the
winter was one month off, and that he called his autumn-viking." (6)

Toward the end of the ninth century Harold Fairhair, either spurred
by the example of Charlemagne, or really prompted, as Snorri Sturluson
tells us, resolved to bring all Norway under him. As Snorri has it in
"Heimskringla": "King Harold sent his men to a girl hight Gyda.... The
king wanted her for his leman; for she was wondrous beautiful but of
high mood withal. Now when the messengers came there and gave their
message to her, she made answer that she would not throw herself away
even to take a king for her husband, who swayed no greater kingdom than
a few districts; 'And methinks,' said she, 'it is a marvel that no king
here in Norway will put all the land under him, after the fashion that
Gorm the Old did in Denmark, or Eric at Upsala.' The messengers deemed
this a dreadfully proud-spoken answer, and asked her what she thought
would come of such an one, for Harold was so mighty a man that his
asking was good enough for her. But although she had replied to their
saying otherwise than they would, they saw no likelihood, for this
while, of bearing her along with them against her will, so they made
ready to fare back again. When they were ready and the folk followed
them out, Gyda said to the messengers--'Now tell to King Harold these my
words:--I will only agree to be his lawful wife upon the condition that
he shall first, for sake of me, put under him the whole of Norway, so
that he may bear sway over that kingdom as freely and fully as King
Eric over the realm of Sweden, or King Gorm over Denmark; for only then,
methinks, can he be called king of a people.' Now his men came back to
King Harold, bringing him the words of the girl, and saying she was so
bold and heedless that she well deserved the king should send a greater
troop of people for her, and put her to some disgrace. Then answered the
king. 'This maid has not spoken or done so much amiss that she should
be punished, but the rather should she be thanked for her words. She has
reminded me,' said he, 'of somewhat that it seems wonderful I did not
think of before. And now,' added he, 'I make the solemn vow, and take
who made me and rules over all things, to witness that never shall I
clip or comb my hair until I have subdued all Norway with scatt, and
duties, and lordships; or, if not, have died in the seeking.' Guttorm
gave great thanks to the king for his oath, saying it was "royal work
fulfilling royal rede." The new and strange government that Harold tried
to enforce--nothing less than the feudal system in a rough guise --which
made those who had hitherto been their own men save at special times,
the king's men at all times, and laid freemen under tax, was withstood
as long as might be by the sturdy Norsemen. It was only by dint of hard
fighting that he slowly won his way, until at Hafrsfirth he finally
crushed all effective opposition. But the discontented, "and they were a
great multitude," fled oversea to the outlands, Iceland, the Faroes, the
Orkneys, and Ireland. The whole coast of Europe, even to Greece and the
shores of the Black Sea, the northern shores of Africa, and the western
part of Asia, felt the effects also. Rolf Pad-th'-hoof, son of Harold's
dear friend Rognvald, made an outlaw for a cattle-raid within the bounds
of the kingdom, betook himself to France, and, with his men, founded a
new people and a dynasty.

Iceland had been known for a good many years, but its only dwellers had
been Irish Culdees, who sought that lonely land to pray in peace. Now,
however, both from Norway and the Western Isles settlers began to come
in. Aud, widow of Olaf the White, King of Dublin, came, bringing with
her many of mixed blood, for the Gaedhil (pronounced "Gael", Irish) and
the Gaill (pronounced "Gaul", strangers) not only fought furiously, but
made friends firmly, and often intermarried. Indeed, the Westmen were
among the first arrivals, and took the best parts of the island--on its
western shore, appropriately enough. After a time the Vikings who had
settled in the Isles so worried Harold and his kingdom, upon which they
swooped every other while, that he drew together a mighty force, and
fell upon them wheresoever he could find them, and followed them up with
fire and sword; and this he did twice, so that in those lands none could
abide but folk who were content to be his men, however lightly they
might hold their allegiance. Hence it was to Iceland that all turned
who held to the old ways, and for over sixty years from the first comer
there was a stream of hardy men pouring in, with their families and
their belongings, simple yeomen, great and warwise chieftains, rich
landowners, who had left their land "for the overbearing of King
Harold," as the "Landnamabok" (7) has it. "There also we shall escape
the troubling of kings and scoundrels", says the "Vatsdaelasaga". So
much of the best blood left Norway that the king tried to stay the leak
by fines and punishments, but in vain.

As his ship neared the shore, the new-coming chief would leave it to
the gods as to where he settled. The hallowed pillars of the high seat,
which were carried away from his old abode, were thrown overboard, with
certain rites, and were let drive with wind and wave until they came
ashore. The piece of land which lay next the beach they were flung upon
was then viewed from the nearest hill-summit, and place of the homestead
picked out. Then the land was hallowed by being encircled with fire,
parcelled among the band, and marked out with boundary-signs; the houses
were built, the "town" or home-field walled in, a temple put up, and the
settlement soon assumed shape. In 1100 there were 4500 franklins, making
a population of about 50,000, fully three-fourths of whom had a strong
infusion of Celtic blood in them. The mode of life was, and is, rather
pastoral than aught else. In the 39,200 square miles of the island's
area there are now about 250 acres of cultivated land, and although
there has been much more in times past, the Icelanders have always been
forced to reckon upon flocks and herds as their chief resources, grain
of all kinds, even rye, only growing in a few favoured places, and very
rarely there; the hay, self-sown, being the only certain harvest. On
the coast fishing and fowling were of help, but nine-tenths of the folk
lived by their sheep and cattle. Potatoes, carrots, turnips, and several
kinds of cabbage have, however, been lately grown with success. They
produced their own food and clothing, and could export enough wool,
cloth, horn, dried fish, etc., as enabled them to obtain wood for
building, iron for tools, honey, wine, grain, etc, to the extent of
their simple needs. Life and work was lotted by the seasons and
their changes; outdoor work--fishing, herding, hay-making, and
fuel-getting--filling the long days of summer, while the long, dark
winter was used in weaving and a hundred indoor crafts. The climate is
not so bad as might be expected, seeing that the island touches the
polar circle, the mean temperature at Reykjavik being 39 degrees.

The religion which the settlers took with them into Iceland--the
ethnic religion of the Norsefolk, which fought its last great fight at
Sticklestead, where Olaf Haraldsson lost his life and won the name of
Saint--was, like all religions, a compound of myths, those which had
survived from savage days, and those which expressed the various degrees
of a growing knowledge of life and better understanding of nature. Some
historians and commentators are still fond of the unscientific method of
taking a later religion, in this case christianity, and writing down all
apparently coincident parts of belief, as having been borrowed from the
christian teachings by the Norsefolk, while all that remain they lump
under some slighting head. Every folk has from the beginning of time
sought to explain the wonders of nature, and has, after its own fashion,
set forth the mysteries of life. The lowest savage, no less than his
more advanced brother, has a philosophy of the universe by which he
solves the world-problem to his own satisfaction, and seeks to reconcile
his conduct with his conception of the nature of things. Now, it is not
to be thought, save by "a priori" reasoners, that such a folk as the
Northmen--a mighty folk, far advanced in the arts of life, imaginative,
literary--should have had no further creed than the totemistic myths
of their primitive state; a state they have wholly left ere they enter
history. Judging from universal analogy, the religion of which record
remains to us was just what might be looked for at the particular stage
of advancement the Northmen had reached. Of course something may have
been gained from contact with other peoples--from the Greeks during the
long years in which the northern races pressed upon their frontier; from
the Irish during the existence of the western viking-kingdoms; but what
I particularly warn young students against is the constant effort of
a certain order of minds to wrest facts into agreement with their pet
theories of religion or what not. The whole tendency of the more modern
investigation shows that the period of myth-transmission is long over
ere history begins. The same confusion of different stages of
myth-making is to be found in the Greek religion, and indeed in those of
all peoples; similar conditions of mind produce similar practices, apart
from all borrowing of ideas and manners; in Greece we find snake-dances,
bear-dances, swimming with sacred pigs, leaping about in imitation of
wolves, dog-feasts, and offering of dogs' flesh to the gods--all of them
practices dating from crude savagery, mingled with ideas of exalted and
noble beauty, but none now, save a bigot, would think of accusing the
Greeks of having stolen all their higher beliefs. Even were some part of
the matter of their myths taken from others, yet the Norsemen have given
their gods a noble, upright, great spirit, and placed them upon a high
level that is all their own. (8) From the prose Edda the following
all too brief statement of the salient points of Norse belief is made
up:--"The first and eldest of gods is hight Allfather; he lives from
all ages, and rules over all his realm, and sways all things great and
small; he smithied heaven and earth, and the lift, and all that belongs
to them; what is most, he made man, and gave him a soul that shall live
and never perish; and all men that are right-minded shall live and be
with himself in Vingolf; but wicked men fare to Hell, and thence into
Niithell, that is beneath in the ninth world. Before the earth ''twas
the morning of time, when yet naught was, nor sand nor sea was
there, nor cooling streams. Earth was not found, nor Heaven above; a
Yawning-gap there was, but grass nowhere.' Many ages ere the earth was
shapen was Niflheim made, but first was that land in the southern sphere
hight Muspell, that burns and blazes, and may not be trodden by those
who are outlandish and have no heritage there. Surtr sits on the border
to guard the land; at the end of the world he will fare forth, and harry
and overcome all the gods and burn the world with fire. Ere the races
were yet mingled, or the folk of men grew, Yawning-gap, which looked
towards the north parts, was filled with thick and heavy ice and
rime, and everywhere within were fog and gusts; but the south side
of Yawning-gap lightened by the sparks and gledes that flew out of
Muspell-heim; as cold arose out of Niflheim and all things grim, so was
that part that looked towards Muspell hot and bright; but Yawning-gap
was as light as windless air, and when the blast of heat met the rime,
so that it melted and dropped and quickened; from those life-drops
there was shaped the likeness of a man, and he was named Ymir; he was
bad, and all his kind; and so it is said, when he slept he fell into a
sweat; then waxed under his left hand a man and a woman, and one of his
feet got a son with the other, and thence cometh the Hrimthursar. The
next thing when the rime dropped was that the cow hight Audhumla was
made of it; but four milk-rivers ran out of her teats, and she fed Ymir;
she licked rime-stones that were salt, and the first day there came at
even, out of the stones, a man's hair, the second day a man's head, the
third day all the man was there. He is named Turi; he was fair of
face, great and mighty; he gat a son named Bor, who took to him Besla,
daughter of Bolthorn, the giant, and they had three sons, Odin, Vili,
and Ve. Bor's sons slew Ymir the giant, but when he fell there ran so
much blood out of his wounds that all the kin of the Hrimthursar were
drowned, save Hvergelmir and his household, who got away in a boat. Then
Bor's sons took Ymir and bore him into the midst of Yawning-gap, and
made of him the earth; of his blood seas and waters, of his flesh earth
was made; they set the earth fast, and laid the sea round about it in
a ring without; of his bones were made rocks; stones and pebbles of his
teeth and jaws and the bones that were broken; they took his skull and
made the lift thereof, and set it up over the earth with four sides, and
under each corner they set dwarfs, and they took his brain and cast it
aloft, and made clouds. They took the sparks and gledes that went loose,
and had been cast out of Muspellheim, and set them in the lift to give
light; they gave resting-places to all fires, and set some in the lift;
some fared free under it, and they gave them a place and shaped their
goings. A wondrous great smithying, and deftly done. The earth is
fashioned round without, and there beyond, round about it lies the deep
sea; and on that sea-strand the gods gave land for an abode to the giant
kind, but within on the earth made they a burg round the world against
restless giants, and for this burg reared they the brows of Ymir, and
called the burg Midgard. The gods went along the sea-strand and found
two stocks, and shaped out of them men; the first gave soul and life,
the second wit and will to move, the third face, hearing, speech, and
eyesight. They gave them clothing and names; the man Ask and the woman
Embla; thence was mankind begotten, to whom an abode was given under
Midgard. Then next Bor's sons made them a burg in the midst of the
world, that is called Asgard; there abode the gods and their kind, and
wrought thence many tidings and feats, both on earth and in the Sky.
Odin, who is hight Allfather, for that he is the father of all men and
sat there in his high seat, seeing over the whole world and each man's
doings, and knew all things that he saw. His wife was called Frigg, and
their offspring is the Asa-stock, who dwell in Asgard and the realms
about it, and all that stock are known to be gods. The daughter and wife
of Odin was Earth, and of her he got Thor, him followed strength and
sturdiness, thereby quells he all things quick; the strongest of all
gods and men, he has also three things of great price, the hammer
Miolnir, the best of strength belts, and when he girds that about him
waxes his god strength one-half, and his iron gloves that he may not
miss for holding his hammer's haft. Balidr is Odin's second son, and
of him it is good to say, he is fair and: bright in face, and hair, and
body, and him all praise; he is wise and fair-spoken and mild, and that
nature is in him none may withstand his doom. Tyr is daring and best of
mood; there is a saw that he is tyrstrong who is before other men and
never yields; he is also so wise that it is said he is tyrlearned who
is wise. Bragi is famous for wisdom, and best in tongue-wit, and cunning
speech, and song-craft. 'And many other are there, good and great; and
one, Loki, fair of face, ill in temper and fickle of mood, is called the
backbiter of the Asa, and speaker of evil redes and shame of all gods
and men; he has above all that craft called sleight, and cheats all
in all things. Among the children of Loki are Fenris-wolf and
Midgards-worm; the second lies about all the world in the deep sea,
holding his tail in his teeth, though some say Thor has slain him; but
Fenris-wolf is bound until the doom of the gods, when gods and men shall
come to an end, and earth and heaven be burnt, when he shall slay Odin.
After this the earth shoots up from the sea, and it is green and fair,
and the fields bear unsown, and gods and men shall be alive again, and
sit in fair halls, and talk of old tales and the tidings that
happened aforetime. The head-seat, or holiest-stead, of the gods is at
Yggdrasil's ash, which is of all trees best and biggest; its boughs are
spread over the whole world and stand above heaven; one root of the ash
is in heaven, and under the root is the right holy spring; there hold
the gods doom every day; the second root is with the Hrimthursar,
where before was Yawning-gap; under that root is Mimir's spring, where
knowledge and wit lie hidden; thither came Allfather and begged a drink,
but got it not before he left his eye in pledge; the third root is
over Niflheim, and the worm Nidhogg gnaws the root beneath. A fair hall
stands under the ash by the spring, and out of it come three maidens,
Norns, named Has-been, Being, Will-be, who shape the lives of men; there
are beside other Norns, who come to every man that is born to shape his
life, and some of these are good and some evil. In the boughs of the
ash sits an eagle, wise in much, and between his eyes sits the hawk
Vedrfalnir; the squirrel Ratatoskr runs up and down along the ash,
bearing words of hate betwixt the eagle and the worm. Those Norns who
abide by the holy spring draw from it every day water, and take the clay
that lies around the well, and sprinkle them up over the ash for that
its boughs should not wither or rot. All those men that have fallen in
the fight, and borne wounds and toil unto death, from the beginning of
the world, are come to Odin in Valhall; a very great throng is there,
and many more shall yet come; the flesh of the boar Soerfmnir is sodden
for them every day, and he is whole again at even; and the mead they
drink that flows from the teats of the she-goat Heidhrun. The meat Odin
has on his board he gives to his two wolves, Geri and Freki, and he
needs no meat, wine is to him both meat and drink; ravens twain sit on
his shoulders, and say into his ear all tidings that they see and hear;
they are called Huginn and Muninn (mind and memory); them sends he at
dawn to fly over the whole world, and they come back at breakfast-tide,
thereby becomes he wise in many tidings, and for this men call him
Raven's-god. Every day, when they have clothed them, the heroes put on
their arms and go out into the yard and fight and fell each other; that
is their play, and when it looks toward mealtime, then ride they home to
Valhall and sit down to drink. For murderers and men forsworn is a great
hall, and a bad, and the doors look northward; it is altogether wrought
of adder-backs like a wattled house, but the worms' heads turn into the
house, and blow venom, so that rivers of venom run along the hall, and
in those rivers must such men wade forever." There was no priest-class;
every chief was priest for his own folk, offered sacrifice, performed
ceremonies, and so on.

In politics the homestead, with its franklin-owner, was the unit; the
"thing", or hundred-moot, the primal organisation, and the "godord",
or chieftainship, its tie. The chief who had led a band of kinsmen and
followers to the new country, taken possession of land, and shared it
among them, became their head-ruler and priest at home, speaker and
president of their Thing, and their representative in any dealings with
neighbouring chiefs and their clients. He was not a feudal lord, for
any franklin could change his "godord" as he liked, and the right
of "judgment by peers" was in full use. At first there was no higher
organisation than the local thing. A central thing, and a speaker to
speak a single "law" for the whole island, was instituted in 929, and
afterwards the island was divided in four quarters, each with a court,
under the Al-thing. Society was divided only into two classes of men,
the free and unfree, though political power was in the hands of the
franklins alone; "godi" and thrall ate the same food, spoke the same
tongue, wore much the same clothes, and were nearly alike in life and
habits. Among the free men there was equality in all but wealth and the
social standing that cannot be separated therefrom. The thrall was a
serf rather than a slave, and could own a house, etc., of his own. In a
generation or so the freeman or landless retainer, if he got a homestead
of his own, was the peer of the highest in the land. During the tenth
century Greenland was colonised from Iceland, and by end of the same
century christianity was introduced into Iceland, but made at first
little difference in arrangements of society. In the thirteenth century
disputes over the power and jurisdiction of the clergy led, with other
matters, to civil war, ending in submission to Norway, and the breaking
down of all native great houses. Although life under the commonwealth
had been rough and irregular, it had been free and varied, breeding
heroes and men of mark; but the "law and order" now brought in left
all on a dead level of peasant proprietorship, without room for hope
or opening for ambition. An alien governor ruled the island, which
was divided under him into local counties, administered by sheriffs
appointed by the king of Norway. The Al-thing was replaced by a royal
court, the local work of the local things was taken by a subordinate
of the sheriff, and things, quarter-courts, trial by jury, and all the
rest, were swept away to make room for these "improvements", which have
lasted with few changes into this century. In 1380 the island passed
under the rule of Denmark, and so continues. (9) During the fifteenth
century the English trade was the only link between Iceland and the
outer world; the Danish government weakened that link as much as it
could, and sought to shut in and monopolise everything Icelandic; under
the deadening effect of such rule it is no marvel that everything found
a lower level, and many things went out of existence for lack of use.
In the sixteenth century there is little to record but the Reformation,
which did little good, if any, and the ravages of English, Gascon, and
Algerine pirates who made havoc on the coast; (10) they appear toward
the close of the century and disappear early in the seventeenth. In the
eighteenth century small-pox, sheep disease, famine, and the terrible
eruptions of 1765 and 1783, follow one another swiftly and with terrible
effect. At the beginning of the present century Iceland, however,
began to shake off the stupor her ill-hap had brought upon her, and
as European attention had been drawn to her, she was listened to.
Newspapers, periodicals, and a Useful Knowledge Society were started;
then came free trade, and the "home-rule" struggle, which met with
partial success in 1874, and is still being carried on. A colony, Gimli,
in far-off Canada, has been formed of Icelandic emigrants, and large
numbers have left their mother-land; but there are many co-operative
societies organised now, which it is hoped will be able to so revive the
old resources of the island as to make provision for the old population
and ways of life. There is now again a representative central council,
but very many of the old rights and powers have not been yet restored.
The condition of society is peculiar absence of towns, social equality,
no abject poverty or great wealth, rarity of crime, making it easy for
the whole country to be administered as a co-operative commonwealth
without the great and striking changes rendered necessary by more
complicated systems.

Iceland has always borne a high name for learning and literature; on
both sides of their descent people inherited special poetic power. Some
of older Eddaic fragments attest the great reach and deep overpowering
strength of imagination possessed by their Norse ancestors; and
they themselves had been quickened by a new leaven. During the first
generations of the "land-taking" a great school of poetry which had
arisen among the Norsemen of the Western Isles was brought by them to
Iceland. (11) The poems then produced are quite beyond parallel with
those of any Teutonic language for centuries after their date, which lay
between the beginning of the ninth and the end of the tenth centuries.
Through the Greenland colony also came two, or perhaps more, great poems
of this western school. This school grew out of the stress and storm of
the viking life, with its wild adventure and varied commerce, and the
close contact with an artistic and inventive folk, possessed of high
culture and great learning. The infusion of Celtic blood, however
slight it may have been, had also something to do with the swift intense
feeling and rapidity of passion of the earlier Icelandic poets. They
are hot-headed and hot-hearted, warm, impulsive, quick to quarrel or
to love, faithful, brave; ready with sword or song to battle with all
comers, or to seek adventure wheresoever it might be found. They leave
Iceland young, and wander at their will to different courts of northern
Europe, where they are always held in high honour. Gunnlaug Worm-tongue
(12) in 1004 came to England, after being in Norway, as the saga
says:--"Now sail Gunnlaug and his fellows into the English main, and
come at autumntide south to London Bridge, where they hauled ashore
their ship. Now, at that time King Ethelred, the son of Edgar, ruled
over England, and was a good lord; the winter he sat in London. But
in those days there was the same tongue in England as in Norway and
Denmark; but the tongues changed when William the Bastard won England,
for thenceforward French went current there, for he was of French kin.
Gunnlaug went presently to the king, and greeted him well and worthily.
The king asked him from what land he came, and Gunnlaug told him all as
it was. 'But,' said he, 'I have come to meet thee, lord, for that I have
made a song on thee, and I would that it might please thee to hearken to
that song.' The king said it should be so, and Gunnlaug gave forth the
song well and proudly, and this is the burden thereof--

     "'As God are all folk fearing
     The fire lord King of England,
     Kin of all kings and all folk,
     To Ethelred the head bow.'

The king thanked him for the song, and gave him as song-reward a scarlet
cloak lined with the costliest of furs, and golden-broidered down to
the hem; and made him his man; and Gunnlaug was with him all the winter,
and was well accounted of.

The poems in this volume are part of the wonderful fragments which
are all that remain of ancient Scandinavian poetry. Every piece which
survives has been garnered by Vigfusson and Powell in the volumes of
their "Corpus", where those who seek may find. A long and illustrious
line of poets kept the old traditions, down even to within a couple
centuries, but the earlier great harvest of song was never again
equalled. After christianity had entered Iceland, and that, with other
causes, had quieted men's lives, although the poetry which stood to the
folk in lieu of music did not die away, it lost the exclusive hold it
had upon men's minds. In a time not so stirring, when emotion was not so
fervent or so swift, when there was less to quicken the blood, the story
that had before found no fit expression but in verse, could stretch its
limbs, as it were, and be told in prose. Something of Irish influence
is again felt in this new departure and that marvellous new growth, the
saga, that came from it, but is little more than an influence. Every
people find some one means of expression which more than all else suits
their mood or their powers, and this the Icelanders found in the saga.
This was the life of a hero told in prose, but in set form, after a
regular fashion that unconsciously complied with all epical requirements
but that of verse--simple plot, events in order of time, set phrases for
even the shifting emotion or changeful fortune of a fight or storm,
and careful avoidance of digression, comment, or putting forward by
the narrator of ought but the theme he has in hand; he himself is never
seen. Something in the perfection of the saga is to be traced to the
long winter's evenings, when the whole household, gathered together at
their spinning, weaving, and so on, would listen to one of their number
who told anew some old story of adventure or achievement. In very truth
the saga is a prose epic, and marked by every quality an epic should
possess. Growing up while the deeds of dead heroes were fresh in memory,
most often recited before the sharers in such deeds, the saga, in its
pure form, never goes from what is truth to its teller. Where the saga,
as this one of the Volsungs is founded upon the debris of songs and
poems, even then very old, tales of mythological heroes, of men quite
removed from the personal knowledge of the narrator, yet the story is
so inwound with the tradition of his race, is so much a part of his
thought-life, that every actor in it has for him a real existence. At
the feast or gathering, or by the fireside, as men made nets and women
spun, these tales were told over; in their frequent repetition by men
who believed them, though incident or sequence underwent no change,
they would become closer knit, more coherent, and each an organic whole.
Gradually they would take a regular and accepted form, which would ease
the strain upon the reciter's memory and leave his mind free to adorn
the story with fair devices, that again gave help in the making it
easier to remember, and thus aided in its preservation. After a couple
of generations had rounded and polished the sagas by their telling and
retelling, they were written down for the most part between 1141 and
1220, and so much was their form impressed upon the mind of the folk,
that when learned and literary works appeared, they were written in the
same style; hence we have histories alike of kingdoms, or families, or
miracles, lives of saints, kings, or bishops in saga-form, as well as
subjects that seem at first sight even less hopeful. All sagas that have
yet appeared in English may be found in the book-list at end of this
volume, but they are not a tithe of those that remain.

Of all the stories kept in being by the saga-tellers and left for our
delight, there is none that so epitomises human experience; has within
the same space so much of nature and of life; so fully the temper and
genius of the Northern folk, as that of the Volsungs and Niblungs, which
has in varied shapes entered into the literature of many lands. In
the beginning there is no doubt that the story belonged to the common
ancestral folk of all the Teutonic of Scando-Gothic peoples in the
earliest days of their wanderings. Whether they came from the Hindu
Kush, or originated in Northern Europe, brought it with them from Asia,
or evolved it among the mountains and rivers it has taken for scenery,
none know nor can; but each branch of their descendants has it in one
form or another, and as the Icelanders were the very crown and flower of
the northern folk, so also the story which is the peculiar heritage of
that folk received in their hands its highest expression and most noble
form. The oldest shape in which we have it is in the Eddaic poems, some
of which date from unnumbered generations before the time to which most
of them are usually ascribed, the time of the viking-kingdoms in the
Western Isles. In these poems the only historical name is that of
Attila, the great Hun leader, who filled so large a part of the
imagination of the people whose power he had broken. There is no doubt
that, in the days when the kingdoms of the Scando-Goths reached from the
North Cape to the Caspian, that some earlier great king performed his
part; but, after the striking career of Attila, he became the recognised
type of a powerful foreign potentate. All the other actors are
mythic-heroic. Of the Eddaic songs only fragments now remain, but
ere they perished there arose from them a saga, that now given to the
readers of this. The so-called Anglo-Saxons brought part of the story to
England in "Beowulf"; in which also appear some incidents that are again
given in the Icelandic saga of "Grettir the Strong". Most widely known
is the form taken by the story in the hands of an unknown medieval
German poet, who, from the broken ballads then surviving wrote the
"Nibelungenlied" or more properly "Nibelungen Not" ("The Need of the
Niblungs"). In this the characters are all renamed, some being more
or less historical actors in mid-European history, as Theodoric of the
East-Goths, for instance. The whole of the earlier part of the story has
disappeared, and though Siegfried (Sigurd) has slain a dragon, there is
nothing to connect it with the fate that follows the treasure; Andvari,
the Volsungs, Fafnir, and Regin are all forgotten; the mythological
features have become faint, and the general air of the whole is that of
medieval romance. The swoard Gram is replaced by Balmung, and the Helm
of Awing by the Tarn-cap--the former with no gain, the latter with great
loss. The curse of Andvari, which in the saga is grimly real, working
itself out with slow, sure steps that no power of god or man can turn
aside, in the medieval poem is but a mere scenic effect, a strain of
mystery and magic, that runs through the changes of the story with
much added picturesqueness, but that has no obvious relation to the
working-out of the plot, or fulfilment of their destiny by the different
characters. Brynhild loses a great deal, and is a poor creature when
compared with herself in the saga; Grimhild and her fateful drink have
gone; Gudrun (Chriemhild) is much more complex, but not more tragic;
one new character, Rudiger, appears as the type of chivalry; but Sigurd
(Siegfred) the central figure, though he has lost by the omission of so
much of his life, is, as before, the embodiment of all the virtues that
were dear to northern hearts. Brave, strong, generous, dignified, and
utterly truthful, he moves amid a tangle of tragic events, overmastered
by a mighty fate, and in life or death is still a hero without stain or
flaw. It is no wonder that he survives to this day in the national songs
of the Faroe Islands and in the folk-ballads of Denmark; that his legend
should have been mingled with northern history through Ragnar Lodbrog,
or southern through Attila and Theodoric; that it should have inspired
William Morris in producing the one great English epic of the century;
(13) and Richard Wagner in the mightiest among his music-dramas. Of the
story as told in the saga there is no need here to speak, for to read
it, as may be done a few pages farther on, is that not better than to
read about it? But it may be urged upon those that are pleased and moved
by the passion and power, the strength and deep truth of it, to find out
more than they now know of the folk among whom it grew, and the land in
which they dwelt. In so doing they will come to see how needful are
a few lessons from the healthy life and speech of those days, to be
applied in the bettering of our own.

TRANSLATORS' PREFACE.

In offering to the reader this translation of the most complete and
dramatic form of the great Epic of the North, we lay no claim to special
critical insight, nor do we care to deal at all with vexed questions,
but are content to abide by existing authorities, doing our utmost to
make our rendering close and accurate, and, if it might be so, at the
same time, not over prosaic: it is to the lover of poetry and nature,
rather than to the student, that we appeal to enjoy and wonder at this
great work, now for the first time, strange to say, translated into
English: this must be our excuse for speaking here, as briefly as may
be, of things that will seem to the student over well known to be worth
mentioning, but which may give some ease to the general reader who comes
across our book.

The prose of the "Volsunga Saga" was composed probably some time in the
twelfth century, from floating traditions no doubt; from songs which,
now lost, were then known, at least in fragments, to the Sagaman;
and finally from songs, which, written down about his time, are still
existing: the greater part of these last the reader will find in this
book, some inserted amongst the prose text by the original story-teller,
and some by the present translators, and the remainder in the latter
part of the book, put together as nearly as may be in the order of the
story, and forming a metrical version of the greater portion of it.

These Songs from the Elder Edda we will now briefly compare with the
prose of the Volsung Story, premising that these are the only metrical
sources existing of those from which the Sagaman told his tale.

Except for the short snatch on p. 24 (1) of our translation, nothing is
now left of these till we come to the episode of Helgi Hundings-bane,
Sigurd's half-brother; there are two songs left relating to this, from
which the prose is put together; to a certain extent they cover the same
ground; but the latter half of the second is, wisely as we think, left
untouched by the Sagaman, as its interest is of itself too great not to
encumber the progress of the main story; for the sake of its wonderful
beauty, however, we could not refrain from rendering it, and it will be
found first among the metrical translations that form the second part of
this book.

Of the next part of the Saga, the deaths of Sinfjotli and Sigmund, and
the journey of Queen Hjordis to the court of King Alf, there is no trace
left of any metrical origin; but we meet the Edda once more where Regin
tells the tale of his kin to Sigurd, and where Sigurd defeats and slays
the sons of Hunding: this lay is known as the "Lay of Regin".

The short chap. xvi. is abbreviated from a long poem called the
"Prophecy of Gripir" (the Grifir of the Saga), where the whole story
to come is told with some detail, and which certainly, if drawn out at
length into the prose, would have forestalled the interest of the tale.

In the slaying of the Dragon the Saga adheres very closely to the "Lay
of Fafnir"; for the insertion of the song of the birds to Sigurd the
present translators are responsible.

Then comes the waking of Brynhild, and her wise redes to Sigurd, taken
from the Lay of Sigrdrifa, the greater part of which, in its metrical
form, is inserted by the Sagaman into his prose; but the stanza relating
Brynhild's awaking we have inserted into the text; the latter part,
omitted in the prose, we have translated for the second part of our
book.

Of Sigurd at Hlymdale, of Gudrun's dream, the magic potion of Grimhild,
the wedding of Sigurd consequent on that potion; of the wooing of
Brynhild for Gunnar, her marriage to him, of the quarrel of the Queens,
the brooding grief and wrath of Brynhild, and the interview of Sigurd
with her--of all this, the most dramatic and best-considered parts of
the tale, there is now no more left that retains its metrical form than
the few snatches preserved by the Sagaman, though many of the incidents
are alluded to in other poems.

Chap. xxx. is met by the poem called the "Short Lay of Sigurd",
which, fragmentary apparently at the beginning, gives us something of
Brynhild's awakening wrath and jealousy, the slaying of Sigurd, and the
death of Brynhild herself; this poem we have translated entire.

The Fragments of the "Lay of Brynhild" are what is left of a poem partly
covering the same ground as this last, but giving a different account
of Sigurd's slaying; it is very incomplete, though the Sagaman has drawn
some incidents from it; the reader will find it translated in our second
part.

But before the death of the heroine we have inserted entire into the
text as chap. xxxi. the "First Lay of Gudrun", the most lyrical, the
most complete, and the most beautiful of all the Eddaic poems; a
poem that any age or language might count among its most precious
possessions.

From this point to the end of the Saga it keeps closely to the Songs of
Edda; in chap. xxxii. the Sagaman has rendered into prose the "Ancient
Lay of Gudrun", except for the beginning, which gives again another
account of the death of Sigurd: this lay also we have translated.

The grand poem, called the "Hell-ride of Brynhild", is not represented
directly by anything in the prose except that the Sagaman has supplied
from it a link or two wanting in the "Lay of Sigrdrifa"; it will be
found translated in our second part.

The betrayal and slaughter of the Giukings or Niblungs, and the fearful
end of Atli and his sons, and court, are recounted in two lays, called
the "Lays of Atli"; the longest of these, the "Greenland Lay of Atli",
is followed closely by the Sagaman; the Shorter one we have translated.

The end of Gudrun, of her daughter by Sigurd and of her sons by her last
husband Jonakr, treated of in the last four chapters of the Saga, are
very grandly and poetically given in the songs called the "Whetting of
Gudrun", and the "Lay of Hamdir", which are also among our translations.

These are all the songs of the Edda which the Sagaman has dealt with;
but one other, the "Lament of Oddrun", we have translated on account of
its intrinsic merit.

As to the literary quality of this work we in say much, but we think we
may well trust the reader of poetic insight to break through whatever
entanglement of strange manners or unused element may at first trouble
him, and to meet the nature and beauty with which it is filled: we
cannot doubt that such a reader will be intensely touched by finding,
amidst all its wildness and remoteness, such a startling realism,
such subtilty, such close sympathy with all the passions that may move
himself to-day.

In conclusion, we must again say how strange it seems to us, that this
Volsung Tale, which is in fact an unversified poem, should never before
been translated into English. For this is the Great Story of the
North, which should be to all our race what the Tale of Troy was to the
Greeks--to all our race first, and afterwards, when the change of the
world has made our race nothing more than a name of what has been--a
story too--then should it be to those that come after us no less than
the Tale of Troy has been to us.

THE STORY OF THE VOLSUNGS AND NIBLUNGS.



CHAPTER I. Of Sigi, the Son of Odin.

Here begins the tale, and tells of a man who was named Sigi, and called
of men the son of Odin; another man withal is told of in the tale, hight
Skadi, a great man and mighty of his hands; yet was Sigi the mightier
and the higher of kin, according to the speech of men of that time.
Now Skadi had a thrall with whom the story must deal somewhat, Bredi by
name, who was called after that work which he had to do; in prowess and
might of hand he was equal to men who were held more worthy, yea, and
better than some thereof.

Now it is to be told that, on a time, Sigi fared to the hunting of the
deer, and the thrall with him; and they hunted deer day-long till the
evening; and when they gathered together their prey in the evening, lo,
greater and more by far was that which Bredi had slain than Sigi's prey;
and this thing he much misliked, and he said that great wonder it was
that a very thrall should out-do him in the hunting of deer: so he
fell on him and slew him, and buried the body of him thereafter in a
snow-drift.

Then he went home at evening tide and says that Bredi had ridden away
from him into the wild-wood. "Soon was he out of my sight," he says,
"and naught more I wot of him."

Skadi misdoubted the tale of Sigi, and deemed that this was a guile of
his, and that he would have slain Bredi. So he sent men to seek for him,
and to such an end came their seeking, that they found him in a certain
snow-drift; then said Skadi, that men should call that snow-drift
Bredi's Drift from henceforth; and thereafter have folk followed, so
that in such wise they call every drift that is right great.

Thus it is well seen that Sigi has slain the thrall and murdered him; so
he is given forth to be a wolf in holy places, (1) and may no more abide
in the land with his father; therewith Odin bare him fellowship from the
land, so long a way, that right long it was, and made no stay till he
brought him to certain war-ships. So Sigi falls to lying out a-warring
with the strength that his father gave him or ever they parted; and
happy was he in his warring, and ever prevailed, till he brought
it about that he won by his wars land and lordship at the last; and
thereupon he took to him a noble wife, and became a great and mighty
king, and ruled over the land of the Huns, and was the greatest of
warriors. He had a son by his wife, who was called Refir, who grew up in
his father's house, and soon became great of growth, and shapely.


  ENDNOTES:
  (1)  "Wolf in holy places," a man put out of the pale of society
       for crimes, an outlaw.



CHAPTER II. Of the Birth of Volsung, the Son of Rerir, who was the Son
of Sigi.

Now Sigi grew old, and had many to envy him, so that at last those
turned against him whom he trusted most; yea, even the brothers of his
wife; for these fell on him at his unwariest, when there were few
with him to withstand them, and brought so many against him, that they
prevailed against him, and there fell Sigi and all his folk with him.
But Rerir, his son, was not in this trouble, and he brought together so
mighty a strength of his friends and the great men of the land, that
he got to himself both the lands and kingdom of Sigi his father; and so
now, when he deems that the feet under him stand firm in his rule, then
he calls to mind that which he had against his mother's brothers, who
had slain his father. So the king gathers together a mighty army, and
therewith falls on his kinsmen, deeming that if he made their kinship
of small account, yet none the less they had first wrought evil against
him. So he wrought his will herein, in that he departed not from strife
before he had slain all his father's banesmen, though dreadful the deed
seemed in every wise. So now he gets land, lordship, and fee, and is
become a mightier man than his father before him.

Much wealth won in war gat Rerir to himself, and wedded a wife withal,
such as he deemed meet for him, and long they lived together, but had
no child to take the heritage after them; and ill-content they both were
with that, and prayed the Gods with heart and soul that they might get
them a child. And so it is said that Odin hears their prayer, and Freyia
no less hearkens wherewith they prayed unto her: so she, never lacking
for all good counsel, calls to her her casket-bearing may, (1) the
daughter of Hrimnir the giant, and sets an apple in her hand, and bids
her bring it to the king. She took the apple, and did on her the gear of
a crow, and went flying till she came whereas the king sat on a mound,
and there she let the apple fall into the lap of the king; but he took
the apple, and deemed he knew whereto it would avail; so he goes home
from the mound to his own folk, and came to the queen, and some deal of
that apple she ate.

So, as the tale tells, the queen soon knew that she big with child, but
a long time wore or ever she might give birth to the child: so it befell
that the king must needs go to the wars, after the custom of kings, that
he may keep his own land in peace: and in this journey it came to pass
that Rerir fell sick and got his death, being minded to go home to Odin,
a thing much desired of many folk in those days.

Now no otherwise it goes with the queen's sickness than heretofore, nor
may she be the lighter of her child, and six winters wore away with the
sickness still heavy on her; so that at the last she feels that she may
not live long; wherefore now she bade cut the child from out of her; and
it was done even as she bade; a man-child was it, and great of growth
from his birth, as might well be; and they say that the youngling kissed
his mother or ever she died; but to him is a name given, and he is
called Volsung; and he was king over Hunland in the room of his father.
From his early years he was big and strong, and full of daring in all
manly deeds and trials, and he became the greatest of warriors, and of
good hap in all the battles of his warfaring.

Now when he was fully come to man's estate, Hrimnir the giant sends to
him Ljod his daughter; she of whom the tale told, that she brought the
apple to Rerir, Volsung's father. So Volsung weds her withal; and long
they abode together with good hap and great love. They had ten sons and
one daughter, and their eldest son was hight Sigmund, and their daughter
Signy; and these two were twins, and in all wise the foremost and the
fairest of the children of Volsung the king, and mighty, as all his seed
was; even as has been long told from ancient days, and in tales of long
ago, with the greatest fame of all men, how that the Volsungs have been
great men and high-minded and far above the most of men both in cunning
and in prowess and all things high and mighty.

So says the story that king Volsung let build a noble hall in such a
wise, that a big oak-tree stood therein, and that the limbs of the tree
blossomed fair out over the roof of the hall, while below stood the
trunk within it, and the said trunk did men call Branstock.

CHAPTER III. Of the Sword that Sigmund, Volsung's son, drew from the
Branstock.

There was a king called Siggeir, who ruled over Gothland, a mighty king
and of many folk; he went to meet Volsung, the king, and prayed him for
Signy his daughter to wife; and the king took his talk well, and his
sons withal, but she was loth thereto, yet she bade her father rule in
this as in all other things that concerned her; so the king took such
rede (1) that he gave her to him, and she was betrothed to King Siggeir;
and for the fulfilling of the feast and the wedding, was King Siggeir
to come to the house of King Volsung. The king got ready the feast
according to his best might, and when all things were ready, came the
king's guests and King Siggeir withal at the day appointed, and many a
man of great account had Siggeir with him.

The tale tells that great fires were made endlong the hall, and the
great tree aforesaid stood midmost thereof; withal folk say that, whenas
men sat by the fires in the evening, a certain man came into the hall
unknown of aspect to all men; and suchlike array he had, that over him
was a spotted cloak, and he was bare-foot, and had linen-breeches knit
tight even unto the bone, and he had a sword in his hand as he went up
to the Branstock, and a slouched hat upon his head: huge he was, and
seeming-ancient, and one-eyed. (2) So he drew his sword and smote it
into the tree-trunk so that it sank in up to the hilts; and all held
back from greeting the man. Then he took up the word, and said--

"Whoso draweth this sword from this stock, shall have the same as a gift
from me, and shall find in good sooth that never bare he better sword in
hand than is this."

Therewith out went the old man from the hall, and none knew who he was
or whither he went.

Now men stand up, and none would fain be the last to lay hand to the
sword, for they deemed that he would have the best of it who might first
touch it; so all the noblest went thereto first, and then the others,
one after other; but none who came thereto might avail to pull it out,
for in nowise would it come away howsoever they tugged at it; but now up
comes Sigmund, King Volsung's son, and sets hand to the sword, and pulls
it from the stock, even as if it lay loose before him; so good that
weapon seemed to all, that none thought he had seen such a sword before,
and Siggeir would fain buy it of him at thrice its weight of gold, but
Sigmund said--

"Thou mightest have taken the sword no less than I from there whereas it
stood, if it had been thy lot to bear it; but now, since it has first of
all fallen into my hand, never shalt thou have it, though thou biddest
therefor all the gold thou hast."

King Siggeir grew wroth at these words, and deemed Sigmund had answered
him scornfully, but whereas was a wary man and a double-dealing, he
made as if he heeded this matter in nowise, yet that same evening he
thought how he might reward it, as was well seen afterwards.

CHAPTER IV. How King Siggeir wedded Signy, and bade King Volsung and his
son to Gothland.

Now it is to be told that Siggeir goes to bed by Signy that night, and
the next morning the weather was fair; then says King Siggeir that he
will not bide, lest the wind should wax, or the sea grow impassable;
nor is it said that Volsung or his sons letted him herein, and that the
less, because they saw that he was fain to get him gone from the feast.
But now says Signy to her father--

"I have no will to go away with Seggeir; neither does my heart smile
upon him, and I wot; by my fore-knowledge, and from the fetch (1) of our
kin, that from this counsel will great evil fall on us if this wedding
be not speedily undone."

"Speak in no such wise, daughter!" said he, "for great shame will it be
to him, yea, and to us also, to break troth with him, he being sackless;
(2) and in naught may we trust him, and no friendship shall we have of
him, if these matters are broken off; but he will pay us back in as evil
wise as he may; for that alone is seemly, to hold truly to troth given."

So King Siggeir got ready for home, and before he went from the feast he
bade King Volsung, his father-in-law, come see him in Gothland, and all
his sons with him, whenas three months should be overpast, and to bring
such following with him, as he would have; and as he deemed meet for his
honour; and thereby will Siggeir the king pay back for the shortcomings
of the wedding-feast, in that he would abide thereat but one night only,
a thing not according to the wont of men. So King Volsung gave word to
come on the day named, and the kinsmen-in-law parted, and Siggeir went
home with his wife.

CHAPTER V. Of the Slaying of King Volsung.

Now tells the tale of King Volsung and his sons that they go at the time
appointed to Gothland at the bidding of King Siggeir, and put off from
the land in three ships, all well manned, and have a fair voyage, and
made Gothland late of an evening tide.

But that same night came Signy and called her father and brothers to a
privy talk, and told them what she deemed King Siggeir was minded to do,
and how that he had drawn together an army no man may meet. "And," says
she, "he is minded to do guilefully by you; wherefore I bid you get
ye gone back again to your own land, and gather together the mightiest
power ye may, and then come back hither and avenge you; neither go ye
now to your undoing, for ye shall surely fail not to fall by his wiles
if ye turn not on him even as I bid you."

Then spake Volsung the king, "All people and nations shall tell of the
word I spake, yet being unborn, wherein I vowed a vow that I would flee
in fear from neither fire nor the sword; even so have I done hitherto,
and shall I depart therefrom now I am old? Yea withal never shall the
maidens mock these my sons at the games, and cry out at them that they
fear death; once alone must all men need die, and from that season shall
none escape; so my rede is that we flee nowhither, but do the work of
our hands in as manly wise as we may; a hundred fights have I fought,
and whiles I had more, and whiles I had less, and yet ever had I the
victory, nor shall it ever be heard tell of me that I fled away or
prayed for peace."

Then Signy wept right sore, and prayed that she might not go back to
King Siggeir, but King Volsung answered--

"Thou shalt surely go back to thine husband, and abide with him,
howsoever it fares with us."

So Signy went home, and they abode there that night; but in the morning,
as soon as it was day, Volsung bade his men arise and go aland and make
them ready for battle; so they went aland, all of them all-armed, and
had not long to wait before Siggeir fell on them with all his army, and
the fiercest fight there was betwixt them; and Siggeir cried on his men
to the onset all he might; and so the tale tells that King Volsung and
his sons went eight times right through Siggeir's folk that day, smiting
and hewing on either hand, but when they would do so even once again,
King Volsung fell amidst his folk and all his men withal, saving his ten
sons, for mightier was the power against them than they might withstand.

But now are all his sons taken, and laid in bonds and led away; and
Signy was ware withal that her father was slain, and her brothers taken
and doomed to death; that she called King Siggeir apart to talk with
her, and said--

"This will I pray of thee, that thou let not slay my brothers hastily,
but let them be set awhile in the stocks, for home to me comes the saw
that says, "Sweet to eye while seen": but longer life I pray not for
them, because I wot well that my prayer will not avail me."

Then answered Siggeir:

"Surely thou art mad and witless, praying thus for more bale for thy
brothers than their present slaying; yet this will I grant thee, for the
better it likes me the more they must bear, and the longer their pain is
or ever death come to them."

Now he let it be done even as she prayed, and a mighty beam was brought
and set on the feet of those ten brethren in a certain place of the
wild-wood, and there they sit day-long until night; but at midnight, as
they sat in the stocks, there came on them a she-wolf from out the wood;
old she was, and both great and evil of aspect; and the first thing she
did was to bite one of those brethren till he died, and then she ate him
up withal, and went on her way.

But the next morning Signy sent a man to the brethren, even one whom she
most trusted, to wot of the tidings; and when he came back he told her
that one of them was dead, and great and grievous she deemed it, if they
should all fare in like wise, and yet naught might she avail them.

Soon is the tale told thereof: nine nights together came the she-wolf
at midnight, and each night slew and ate up one of the brethren, until
all were dead, save Sigmund only; so now, before the tenth night came,
Signy sent that trusty man to Sigmund, her brother, and gave honey into
his hand, bidding him do it over Sigmund's face, and set a little deal
of it in his mouth; so he went to Sigmund and did as he was bidden, and
then came home again; and so the next night came the she-wolf according
to her wont, and would slay him and eat him even as his brothers; but
now she sniffs the breeze from him, whereas he was anointed with the
honey, and licks his face all over with her tongue, and then thrusts
her tongue into the mouth of him. No fear he had thereof, but caught
the she-wolf's tongue betwixt his teeth, and so hard she started back
thereat, and pulled herself away so mightily, setting her feet against
the stocks, that all was riven asunder; but he ever held so fast that the
tongue came away by the roots, and thereof she had her bane.

But some men say that this same she-wolf was the mother of King
Siggeir, who had turned herself into this likeness by troll's lore and
witchcraft.



CHAPTER VI. Of how Signy sent the Children of her and Siggeir to
Sigmund.

Now whenas Sigmund is loosed and the stocks are broken, he dwells in the
woods and holds himself there; but Signy sends yet again to wot of the
tidings, whether Sigmund were alive or no; but when those who were sent
came to him, he told them all as it had betid, and how things had gone
betwixt him and the wolf; so they went home and tell Signy the tidings;
but she goes and finds her brother, and they take counsel in such wise
as to make a house underground in the wild-wood; and so things go on a
while, Signy hiding him there, and sending him such things as he needed;
but King Siggeir deemed that all the Volsungs were dead.

Now Siggeir had two sons by his wife, whereof it is told that when the
eldest was ten winters old, Signy sends him to Sigmund, so that he might
give him help, if he would in any wise strive to avenge his father;
so the youngling goes to the wood, and comes late in evening-tide to
Sigmund's earth-house; and Sigmund welcomed him in seemly fashion, and
said that he should make ready their bread; "But I," said he, "will go
seek firewood."

Therewith he gives the meal-bag into his hands while he himself went to
fetch firing; but when he came back the youngling had done naught at the
bread-making. Then asks Sigmund if the bread be ready--

Says the youngling, "I durst not set hand to the meal sack, because
somewhat quick lay in the meal."

Now Sigmund deemed he wotted that the lad was of no such heart as that
he would be fain to have him for his fellow; and when he met his sister,
Sigmund said that he had come no nigher to the aid of a man though the
youngling were with him.

Then said Signy, "Take him and kill him then; for why should such an one
live longer?" and even so he did.

So this winter wears, and the next winter Signy sent her next son to
Sigmund; and there is no need to make a long tale thereof, for in like
wise went all things, and he slew the child by the counsel of Signy.



CHAPTER VII. Of the Birth of Sinfjotli the Son of Sigmund.

So on a tide it befell as Signy sat in her bower, that there came to her
a witch-wife exceeding cunning, and Signy talked with her in such wise,
"Fain am I," says she, "that we should change semblances together."

She says, "Even as thou wilt then."

And so by her wiles she brought it about that they changed semblances,
and now the witch-wife sits in Signy's place according to her rede, and
goes to bed by the king that night, and he knows not that he has other
than Signy beside him.

But the tale tells of Signy, that she fared to the earth-house of her
brother, and prayed him give her harbouring for the night; "For I have
gone astray abroad in the woods, and know not whither I am going."

So he said she might abide, and that he would not refuse harbour to one
lone woman, deeming that she would scarce pay back his good cheer by
tale-bearing: so she came into the house, and they sat down to meat,
and his eyes were often on her, and a goodly and fair woman she seemed
to him; but when they are full, then he says to her, that he is right
fain that they should have but one bed that night; she nowise turned
away therefrom, and so for three nights together he laid her in bed by
him.

Thereafter she fared home, and found the witch-wife and bade her change
semblances again, and she did so.

Now as time wears, Signy brings forth a man-child, who was named
Sinfjotli, and when he grew up he was both big and strong, and fair of
face, and much like unto the kin of the Volsungs, and he was hardly yet
ten winters old when she sent him to Sigmund's earth-house; but this
trial she had made of her other sons or ever she had sent them to
Sigmund, that she had sewed gloves on to their hands through flesh and
skin, and they had borne it ill and cried out thereat; and this she now
did to Sinfjotli, and he changed countenance in nowise thereat. Then she
flayed off the kirtle so that the skin came off with the sleeves, and
said that this would be torment enough for him; but he said--

"Full little would Volsung have felt such a smart this."

So the lad came to Sigmund, and Sigmund bade him knead their meal up,
while he goes to fetch firing; so he gave him the meal-sack, and then
went after the wood, and by then he came back had Sinfjotli made an end
of his baking. Then asked Sigmund if he had found nothing in the meal.

"I misdoubted me that there was something quick in the meal when I first
fell to kneading of it, but I have kneaded it all up together, both the
meal and that which was therein, whatsoever it was."

Then Sigmund laughed out, he said--

"Naught wilt thou eat of this bread to-night, for the most deadly of
worms (1) hast thou kneaded up therewith."

Now Sigmund was so mighty a man that he might eat venom and have no hurt
therefrom; but Sinfjotli might abide whatso venom came on the outside of
him, but might neither eat nor drink thereof.

CHAPTER VIII. The Death of King Siggeir and of Signy.

The tale tells that Sigmund thought Sinfjotli over young to help him to
his revenge, and will first of all harden him with manly deeds; so in
summer-tide they fare wide through the woods and slay men for their
wealth; Sigmund deems him to take much after the kin of the Volsungs,
though he thinks that he is Siggeir's son, and deems him to have the
evil heart of his father, with the might and daring of the Volsungs;
withal he must needs think him in no wise a kinsome man, for full oft
would he bring Sigmund's wrongs to his memory, and prick him on to slay
King Siggeir.

Now on a time as they fare abroad in the wood for the getting of wealth,
they find a certain house, and two men with great gold rings asleep
therein: now these twain were spell-bound skin-changers, (1) and
wolf-skins were hanging up over them in the house; and every tenth
day might they come out of those skins; and they were kings' sons: so
Sigmund and Sinfjofli do the wolf-skins on them, and then might they
nowise come out of them, though forsooth the same nature went with them
as heretofore; they howled as wolves howl, but both knew the meaning of
that howling; they lay out in the wild-wood, and each went his way; and
a word they made betwixt them, that they should risk the onset of seven
men, but no more, and that he who was first to be set on should howl in
wolfish wise: "Let us not depart from this," says Sigmund, "for thou art
young and over-bold, and men will deem the quarry good, when they take
thee."

Now each goes his way, and when they were parted, Sigmund meets certain
men, and gives forth a wolf's howl; and when Sinfjotli heard it, he went
straightway thereto, and slew them all, and once more they parted. But
ere Sinfjotli has fared long through the woods, eleven men meet him,
and he wrought in such wise that he slew them all, and was awearied
therewith, and crawls under an oak, and there takes his rest. Then came
Sigmund thither, and said--

"Why didst thou not call on me?"

Sinfjotli said, "I was loth to call for thy help for the slaying of
eleven men."

Then Sigmund rushed at him so hard that he staggered and fell, and
Sigmund bit him in the throat. Now that day they might not come out of
their wolf-skins: but Sigmund lays the other on his back, and bears
him home to the house, and cursed the wolf-gears and gave them to the
trolls. Now on a day he saw where two weasels went, and how that one bit
the other in the throat, and then ran straightway into the thicket, and
took up a leaf and laid it on the wound, and thereon his fellow sprang
up quite and clean whole; so Sigmund went out and saw a raven flying
with a blade of that same herb to him; so he took it and drew it over
Sinfjotli's hurt, and he straightway sprang up as whole as though he had
never been hurt. Thereafter they went home to their earth-house, and
abode there till the time came for them to put off the wolf-shapes; then
they burnt them up with fire, and prayed that no more hurt might come
to any one from them; but in that uncouth guise they wrought many famous
deeds in the kingdom and lordship of King Siggeir.

Now when Sinfjotli was come to man's estate, Sigmund deemed he had tried
him fully, and or ever a long time has gone by he turns his mind to the
avenging of his father, if so it may be brought about; so on a certain
day the twain get them gone from their earth-house, and come to the
abode of King Siggeir late in the evening, and go into the porch before
the hall, wherein were tuns of ale, and there they lie hid: now the
queen is ware of them, where they are, and is fain to meet them; and
when they met they took counsel, and were of one mind that Volsung should
be revenged that same night.

Now Signy and the king had two children of tender age, who played with
a golden toy on the floor, and bowled it along the pavement of the hall,
running along with it; but therewith a golden ring from off it trundles
away into the place where Sigmund and Sinfjotli lay, and off runs the
little one to search for the same, and beholds withal where two men are
sitting, big and grimly to look on, with overhanging helms and bright
white byrnies; (2) so he runs up the hall to his father, and tells him
of the sight he has seen, and thereat the king misdoubts of some guile
abiding him; but Signy heard their speech, and arose and took both the
children, and went out into the porch to them and said--

"Lo ye! These younglings have bewrayed you; come now therefore and slay
them!"

Sigmund says, "Never will I slay thy children for telling of where I lay
hid."

But Sinfjotli made little enow of it, but drew his sword and slew them
both, and cast them into the hall at King Siggeir's feet.

Then up stood the king and cried on his men to take those who had lain
privily in the porch through the night. So they ran thither and would
lay hands on them, but they stood on their defence well and manly, and
long he remembered it who was the nighest to them; but in the end they
were borne down by many men and taken, and bonds were set upon them, and
they were cast into fetters wherein they sit night long.

Then the king ponders what longest and worst of deaths he shall mete out
to them; and when morning came he let make a great barrow of stones and
turf; and when it was done, let set a great flat stone midmost inside
thereof, so that one edge was aloft, the other alow; and so great it was
that it went from wall to wall, so that none might pass it.

Now he bids folk take Sigmund and Sinfjotli and set them in the barrow,
on either side of the stone, for the worse for them he deemed it, that
they might hear each the other's speech, and yet that neither might pass
one to the other. But now, while they were covering in the barrow with
the turf-slips, thither came Signy, bearing straw with her, and cast it
down to Sinfjotli, and bade the thralls hide this thing from the king;
they said yea thereto, and therewithal was the barrow closed in.

But when night fell, Sinfjotli said to Sigmund, "Belike we shall scarce
need meat for a while, for here has the queen cast swine's flesh into
the barrow, and wrapped it round about on the outer side with straw."

Therewith he handles the flesh and finds that therein was thrust
Sigmund's sword; and he knew it by the hilts, as mirk as it might be in
the barrow, and tells Sigmund thereof, and of that were they both fain
enow.

Now Sinfjotli drave the point of the sword up into the big stone, and
drew it hard along, and the sword bit on the stone. With that Sigmund
caught the sword by the point, and in this wise they sawed the stone
between them, and let not or all the sawing was done that need be done,
even as the song sings:

     "Sinfjotli sawed
     And Sigmund sawed,
     Atwain with main
     The stone was done."

Now are they both together loose in the barrow, and soon they cut both
through stone and through iron, and bring themselves out thereof. Then
they go home to the hall, whenas all men slept there, and bear wood to
the hall, and lay fire therein; and withal the folk therein are waked by
the smoke, and by the hall burning over their heads.

Then the king cries out, "Who kindled this fire, I burn withal?"

"Here am I," says Sigmund, "with Sinfjotli, my sister's son; and we are
minded that thou shalt wot well that all the Volsungs are not yet dead."

Then he bade his sister come out, and take all good things at his hands,
and great honour, and fair atonement in that wise, for all her griefs.

But she answered, "Take heed now, and consider, if I have kept King
Siggeir in memory, and his slaying of Volsung the king! I let slay both
my children, whom I deemed worthless for the revenging of our father,
and I went into the wood to thee in a witch-wife's shape; and now
behold, Sinfjotli is the son of thee and of me both! and therefore has
he this so great hardihood and fierceness, in that he is the son both of
Volsung's son and Volsung's daughter; and for this, and for naught else,
have I so wrought, that Siggeir might get his bane at last; and all
these things have I done that vengeance might fall on him, and that I
too might not live long; and merrily now will I die with King Siggeir,
though I was naught merry to wed him."

Therewith she kissed Sigmund her brother, and Sinfjotli, and went back
again into the fire, and there she died with King Siggeir and all his
good men.

But the two kinsmen gathered together folk and ships, and Sigmund went
back to his father's land, and drave away thence the king, who had set
himself down there in the room of king Volsung.

So Sigmund became a mighty King and far-famed, wise and high-minded: he
had to wife one named Borghild, and two sons they had between them, one
named Helgi and the other Hamund; and when Helgi was born, Norns came to
him, (3) and spake over him, and said that he should be in time to come
the most renowned of all kings. Even therewith was Sigmund come home
from the wars, and so therewith he gives him the name of Helgi, and
these matters as tokens thereof, Land of Rings, Sun-litten Hill, and
Sharp-shearing Sword, and withal prayed that he might grow of great
fame, and like unto the kin of the Volsungs.

And so it was that he grew up high-minded, and well-beloved, and above
all other men in all prowess; and the story tells that he went to the
wars when he was fifteen winters old. Helgi was lord and ruler over the
army, but Sinfjotli was gotten to be his fellow herein; and so the twain
bare sway thereover.

       Iceland no less than elsewhere, as see Ari in several places
       of his history, especially the episode of Dufthach and

       wolves at intervals, in the present case compelled so to
       become, wer-wolves or "loupsgarou", find large place in
       medieval story, but were equally well-known in classic
       times.  Belief in them still lingers in parts of Europe
       where wolves are to be found.  Herodotus tells of the Neuri,
       who assumed once a year the shape of wolves; Pliny says that
       one of the family of Antaeus, chosen by lot annually, became
       a wolf, and so remained for nine years; Giraldus Cambrensis
       will have it that Irishmen may become wolves; and Nennius
       asserts point-blank that "the descendants of wolves are
       still in Ossory;" they retransform themselves into wolves
       when they bite.  Apuleius, Petronius, and Lucian have
       similar stories.  The Emperor Sigismund convoked a council
       of theologians in the fifteenth century who decided that
       wer-wolves did exist.

       fountain of Urd ("Urdarbrunur"), which is below one of the
       roots of "Yggdrasil", the world-tree, which tree their
       office it is to nourish by sprinkling it with the waters of
       the fountain.



CHAPTER IX. How Helgi, the son of Sigmund, won King Hodbrod and his
Realm, and wedded Sigrun.

Now the tale tells that Helgi in his warring met a king hight Hunding,
a mighty king, and lord of many men and many lands; they fell to battle
together, and Helgi went forth mightily, and such was the end of that
fight that Helgi had the victory, but King Hunding fell and many of his
men with him; but Helgi is deemed to have grown greatly in fame because
he had slain so mighty a king.

Then the sons of Hunding draw together a great army to avenge their
father. Hard was the fight betwixt them; but Helgi goes through the
folk of those brothers unto their banner, and there slays these sons
of Hunding, Alf and Eyolf, Herward and Hagbard, and wins there a great
victory.

Now as Helgi fared from the fight, he met a many women right fair and
worthy to look on, who rode in exceeding noble array; but one far
excelled them all; then Helgi asked them the name of that their lady and
queen, and she named herself Sigrun, and said she was daughter of King
Hogni.

Then said Helgi, "Fare home with us: good welcome shall ye have!"

Then said the king's daughter, "Other work lies before us than to drink
with thee."

"Yea, and what work, king's daughter?" said Helgi.

She answers, "King Hogni has promised me to Hodbrod, the son of King
Granmar, but I have vowed a vow that I will have him to my husband no
more than if he were a crow's son and not a king's; and yet will the
thing come to pass, but and if thou standest in the way thereof, and
goest against him with an army, and takest me away withal; for verily
with no king would I rather bide on bolster than with thee."

"Be of good cheer, king's daughter," says he, "for certes he and I shall
try the matter, or ever thou be given to him; yea, we shall behold which
may prevail against the other; and hereto I pledge my life."

Thereafter, Helgi sent men with money in their hands to summon his folk
to him, and all his power is called together to Red-Berg: and there
Helgi abode till such time as a great company came to him from Hedinsey;
and therewithal came mighty power from Norvi Sound aboard great and fair
ships. Then King Helgi called to him the captain of his ships, who was
hight Leif, and asked him if he had told over the tale of his army.

"A thing not easy to tell, lord," says he, "on the ships that came out
of Norvi Sound are twelve thousand men, and otherwhere are half as many
again."

Then bade King Helgi turn into the firth, called Varin's firth, and they
did so: but now there fell on them so fierce a storm and so huge a sea,
that the beat of the waves on board and bow was to hearken to like as
the clashing together of high hills broken.

But Helgi bade men fear naught, nor take in any sail, but rather hoist
every rag higher than heretofore; but little did they miss of foundering
or ever they made land; then came Sigrun, daughter of King Hogni, down
on to the beach with a great army, and turned them away thence to a good
haven called Gnipalund; but the landsmen see what has befallen and
come down to the sea-shore. The brother of King Hodbrod, lord of a land
called Swarin's Cairn, cried out to them, and asked them who was captain
over that mighty army. Then up stands Sinfjotli, with a helm on his
head, bright shining as glass, and a byrny as white as snow; a spear
in his hand, and thereon a banner of renown, and a gold-rimmed shield
hanging before him; and well he knew with what words to speak to kings--

"Go thou and say, when thou hast made an end of feeding thy swine and
thy dogs, and when thou beholdest thy wife again, that here are come
the Volsungs, and in this company may King Helgi be found, if Hodbrod
be fain of finding him, for his game and his joy it is to fight and win
fame, while thou art kissing the handmaids by the fire-side."

Then answered Granmar, "In nowise knowest thou how to speak seemly
things, and to tell of matters remembered from of old, whereas thou
layest lies on chiefs and lords; most like it is that thou must have
long been nourished with wolf-meat abroad in the wild-woods, and has
slain thy brethren; and a marvel it is to behold that thou darest to
join thyself to the company of good men and true, thou, who hast sucked
the blood of many a cold corpse."

Sinfjotli answered, "Dim belike is grown thy memory now, of how thou
wert a witch-wife on Varinsey, and wouldst fain have a man to thee, and
chose me to that same office of all the world; and how thereafter thou
wert a Valkyria (1) in Asgarth, and it well-nigh came to this, that for
thy sweet sake should all men fight; and nine wolf whelps I begat on thy
body in Lowness, and was the father to them all."

Granmar answers, "Great skill of lying hast thou; yet belike the father
of naught at all mayst thou be, since thou wert gelded by the giant's
daughters of Thrasness; and lo thou art the stepson of King Siggeir, and
were wont to lie abroad in wilds and woods with the kin of wolves; and
unlucky was the hand wherewith thou slewest thy brethren, making for
thyself an exceeding evil name."

Said Sinfjotli, "Mindest thou not then, when thou were stallion Grani's
mare, and how I rode thee an amble on Bravoll, and that afterwards thou
wert giant Golnir's goat-herd?"

Granmar says, "Rather would I feed fowls with the flesh of thee than
wrangle any longer with thee."

Then spake King Helgi, "Better were it for ye, and a more manly deed, to
fight, rather than to speak such things as it is a shame even to hearken
to; Granmar's sons are no friends of me and of mine, yet are they hardy
men none the less."

So Granmar rode away to meet King Hodbrod, at a stead called Sunfells,
and the horses of the twain were named Sveipud and Sveggjud. The
brothers met in the castle-porch, and Granmar told Hodbrod of the
war-news. King Hodbrod was clad in a byrny, and had his helm on his
head; he asked--

"What men are anigh, why look ye so wrathful?"

Granmar says, "Here are come the Volsungs, and twelve thousand men of
them are afloat off the coast, and seven thousand are at the island
called Sok, but at the stead called Grindur is the greatest company of
all, and now I deem withal that Helgi and his fellowship have good will
to give battle."

Then said the king, "Let us send a message through all our realm, and go
against them, neither let any who is fain of fight sit idle at home; let
us send word to the sons of Ring, and to King Hogni, and to Alf the Old,
for they are mighty warriors."

So the hosts met at Wolfstone, and fierce fight befell there; Helgi
rushed forth through the host of his foes, and many a man fell there; at
last folk saw a great company of shield-maidens, like burning flames to
look on, and there was come Sigrun, the king's daughter. Then King Helgi
fell on King Hodbrod, and smote him, and slew him even under his very
banner; and Sigrun cried out--

"Have thou thanks for thy so manly deed! now shall we share the land
between us, and a day of great good hap this is to me, and for this deed
shalt thou get honour and renown, in that thou hast felled to earth so
mighty a king."

So Helgi took to him that realm and dwelt there long, when he had wedded
Sigrun, and became a king of great honour and renown, though he has
naught more to do with this story.

CHAPTER X. The ending of Sinfjotli, Sigmund's Son.

Now the Volsungs fare back home, and have gained great renown by these
deeds. But Sinfjotli betook himself to warfare anew; and therewith he
had sight of an exceeding fair woman, and yearned above all things for
her; but that same woman was wooed also of the brother of Borghild, the
king's wife: and this matter they fought out betwixt them, and Sinfjotli
slew that king; and thereafter he harried far and wide, and had many
a battle and even gained the day; and he became hereby honoured and
renowned above all men; but in autumn tide he came home with many ships
and abundant wealth.

Then he told his tidings to the king his father, and he again to the
queen, and she for her part bids him get him gone from the realm, and
made as if she would in nowise see him. But Sigmund said he would not
drive him away, and offered her atonement of gold and great wealth for
her brother's life, albeit he said he had never erst given weregild
(1) to any for the slaying of a man, but no fame it was to uphold wrong
against a woman.

So seeing she might not get her own way herein, she said, "Have thy will
in this matter, O my lord, for it is seemly so to be."

And now she holds the funeral feast for her brother by the aid and
counsel of the king, and makes ready all things therefor or in the best of
wise, and bade thither many great men.

At that feast, Borghild the queen bare the drink to folk, and she came
over against Sinfjofli with a great horn, and said--

"Fall to now and drink, fair stepson!"

Then he took the horn to him, and looked therein, and said--

"Nay, for the drink is charmed drink"

Then said Sigmund, "Give it unto me then;" and therewith he took the
horn and drank it off.

But the queen said to Sinfjotli, "Why must other men needs drink thine
ale for thee?" And she came again the second time with the horn, and
said, "Come now and drink!" and goaded him with many words.

And he took the horn, and said--

"Guile is in the drink."

And thereon, Sigmund cried out--

"Give it then unto me!"

Again, the third time, she came to him, and bade him drink off his
drink, if he had the heart of a Volsung; then he laid hand on the horn,
but said--

"Venom is therein."

"Nay, let the lip strain it out then, O son," quoth Sigmund; and by then
was he exceeding drunk with drink, and therefore spake he in that wise.

So Sinfjotli drank, and straightway fell down dead to the ground.

Sigmund rose up, and sorrowed nigh to death over him; then he took the
corpse in his arms and fared away to the wood, and went till he came to
a certain firth; and there he saw a man in a little boat; and that man
asked if he would be wafted by him over the firth, and he said yea
thereto; but so little was the boat, that they might not all go in it
at once, so the corpse was first laid therein, while Sigmund went by
the firth-side. But therewith the boat and the man therein vanished away
from before Sigmund's eyes. (2)

So thereafter Sigmund turned back home, and drave away the queen, and a
little after she died. But Sigmund the king yet ruled his realm, and is
deemed ever the greatest champion and king of the old law.

CHAPTER XI. Of King Sigmund's last Battle, and of how he must yield up his
Sword again.

There was a king called Eylimi, mighty and of great fame, and his
daughter was called Hjordis, the fairest and wisest of womankind; and
Sigmund hears it told of her that she was meet to be his wife, yea if
none else were. So he goes to the house of King Eylimi, who would make
a great feast for him, if so be he comes not thither in the guise of
a foe. So messages were sent from one to the other that this present
journey was a peaceful one, and not for war; so the feast was held in
the best of wise and with many a man thereat; fairs were in every place
established for King Sigmund, and all things else were done to the aid
and comfort of his journey: so he came to the feast, and both kings hold
their state in one hall; thither also was come King Lyngi, son of King
Hunding, and he also is a-wooing the daughter of King Eylimi.

Now the king deemed he knew that the twain had come thither but for one
errand, and thought withal that war and trouble might be looked for
from the hands of him who brought not his end about; so he spake to his
daughter, and said--

"Thou art a wise woman, and I have spoken it, that thou alone shalt
choose a husband for thyself; choose therefore between these two kings,
and my rede shall be even as thine."

"A hard and troublous matter," says she; "yet will I choose him who is
of greatest fame, King Sigmund to wife, albeit he is well stricken in
years."

So to him was she betrothed, and King Lyngi gat him gone. Then was
Sigmund wedded to Hjordis, and now each day was the feast better and
more glorious than on the day before it. But thereafter Sigmund went
back home to Hunland, and King Eylimi, his father-in-law, with him, and
King Sigmund betakes himself to the due ruling of his realm.

But King Lyngi and his brethren gather an army together to fall on
Sigmund, for as in all matters they were wont to have the worser lot,
so did this bite the sorest of all; and they would fain prevail over the
might and pride of the Volsungs. So they came to Hunland, and sent King
Sigmund word how that they would not steal upon him, and that they deemed
he would scarce slink away from them. So Sigmund said he would come and
meet them in battle, and drew his power together; but Hjordis was borne
into the wood with a certain bondmaid, and mighty wealth went with them;
and there she abode the while they fought.

Now the vikings rushed from their ships in numbers not to be borne up
against, but Sigmund the King, and Eylimi, set up their banners, and the
horns blew up to battle; but King Sigmund let blow the horn his father
erst had had, and cheered on his men to the fight, but his army was far
the fewest.

Now was that battle fierce and fell, and though Sigmund were old, yet
most hardily he fought, and was ever the foremost of his men; no shield
or byrny might hold against him, and he went ever through the ranks
of his foemen on that day, and no man might see how things would fare
between them; many an arrow and many a spear was aloft in air that day,
and so his spae-wrights wrought for him that he got no wound, and none
can tell over the tale of those who fell before him, and both his arms
were red with blood, even to the shoulders.

But now whenas the battle had dured a while, there came a man into
the fight clad in a blue cloak, and with a slouched hat on his head,
one-eyed he was, (1) and bare a bill in his hand; and he came against
Sigmund the King, and have up his bill against him, and as Sigmund smote
fiercely with the sword it fell upon the bill and burst asunder in the
midst: thenceforth the slaughter and dismay turned to his side, for the
good-hap of King Sigmund had departed from him, and his men fell fast
about him; naught did the king spare himself, but the rather cheered on
his men; but even as the saw says, "No might 'gainst many", so was it
now proven; and in this fight fell Sigmund the King, and King Eylimi,
his father-in-law, in the fore-front of their battle, and therewith the
more part of their folk.

CHAPTER XII. Of the Shards of the Sword Gram, and how Hjordis went to
King Alf.

Now King Lyngi made for the king's abode, and was minded to take the
king's daughter there, but failed herein, for there he found neither
wife nor wealth: so he fared through all the realm, and gave his men
rule thereover, and now deemed that he had slain all the kin of the
Volsungs, and that he need dread them no more from henceforth.

Now Hjordis went amidst the slain that night of the battle, and came
whereas lay King Sigmund, and asked if he might be healed; but he
answered--

"Many a man lives after hope has grown little; but my good-hap has
departed from me, nor will I suffer myself to be healed, nor wills Odin
that I should ever draw sword again, since this my sword and his is
broken; lo now, I have waged war while it was his will."

"Naught ill would I deem matters," said she, "if thou mightest be healed
and avenge my father."

The king said, "That is fated for another man; behold now, thou art
great with a man-child; nourish him well and with good heed, and the
child shall be the noblest and most famed of all our kin: and keep well
withal the shards of the sword: thereof shall a goodly sword be made,
and it shall be called Gram, and our son shall bear it, and shall work
many a great work therewith, even such as eld shall never minish; for
his name shall abide and flourish as long as the world shall endure: and
let this be enow for thee. But now I grow weary with my wounds, and I
will go see our kin that have gone before me."

So Hjordis sat over him till he died at the day-dawning; and then she
looked, and behold, there came many ships sailing to the land: then she
spake to the handmaid--

"Let us now change raiment, and be thou called by my name, and say that
thou art the king's daughter."

And thus they did; but now the vikings behold the great slaughter of men
there, and see where two women fare away thence into the wood; and they
deem that some great tidings must have befallen, and they leaped ashore
from out their ships. Now the captain of these folks was Alf, son of
Hjalprek, king of Denmark, who was sailing with his power along the
land. So they came into the field among the slain, and saw how many men
lay dead there; then the king bade go seek for the women and bring
them thither, and they did so. He asked them what women they were; and,
little as the thing seems like to be, the bondmaid answered for the
twain, telling of the fall of King Sigmund and King Eylimi, and many
another great man, and who they were withal who had wrought the deed.
Then the king asks if they wotted where the wealth of the king was
bestowed; and then says the bondmaid--

"It may well be deemed that we know full surely thereof."

And therewith she guides them to the place where the treasure lay: and
there they found exceeding great wealth; so that men deem they have
never seen so many things of price heaped up together in one place. All
this they bore to the ships of King Alf, and Hjordis and the bondmaid
went with them. Therewith these sail away to their own realm, and talk
how that surely on that field had fallen the most renowned of kings.

So the king sits by the tiller, but the women abide in the forecastle;
but talk he had with the women and held their counsels of much account.

In such wise the king came home to his realm with great wealth, and he
himself was a man exceeding goodly to look on. But when he had been but
a little while at home, the queen, his mother, asked him why the fairest
of the two women had the fewer rings and the less worthy attire.

"I deem," she said, "that she whom ye have held of least account is the
noblest of the twain."

He answered: "I too have misdoubted me, that she is little like a
bondwoman, and when we first met, in seemly wise she greeted noble men.
Lo now, we will make a trial of the thing."

So on a time as men sat at the drink, the king sat down to talk with the
women, and said:--

"In what wise do ye note the wearing of the hours, whenas night grows
old, if ye may not see the lights of heaven?"

Then says the bondwoman, "This sign have I, that whenas in my youth I
was wont to drink much in the dawn, so now when I no longer use that
manner, I am yet wont to wake up at that very same tide, and by that
token do I know thereof."

Then the king laughed and said, "Ill manners for a king's daughter!" And
therewith he turned to Hjordis, and asked her even the same question;
but she answered--

"My father erst gave me a little gold ring of such nature, that it
groweth cold on my finger in the day-dawning; and that is the sign that
I have to know thereof."

The king answered: "Enow of gold there, where a very bondmaid bore it!
But come now, thou hast been long enow hid from me; yet if thou hadst
told me all from the beginning, I would have done to thee as though we
had both been one king's children: but better than thy deeds will I deal
with thee, for thou shalt be my wife, and due jointure will I pay thee
whenas thou hast borne me a child."

She spake therewith and told out the whole truth about herself: so there
was she held in great honour, and deemed the worthiest of women.



CHAPTER XIII. Of the Birth and Waxing of Sigurd Fafnir's-bane.

The tale tells that Hjordis brought forth a man-child, who was
straightly borne before King Hjalprek, and then was the king glad
thereof, when he saw the keen eyes in the head of him, and he said that
few men would be equal to him or like unto him in any wise. So he was
sprinkled with water, and had to name Sigurd, of whom all men speak
with one speech and say that none was ever his like for growth and
goodliness. He was brought up in the house of King Hjalprek in great
love and honour; and so it is, that whenso all the noblest men and
greatest kings are named in the olden tales, Sigurd is ever put before
them all, for might and prowess, for high mind and stout heart, wherewith
he was far more abundantly gifted than any man of the northern parts of
the wide world.

So Sigurd waxed in King Hjalprek's house, and there was no child but
loved him; through him was Hjordis betrothed to King Alf, and jointure
meted to her.

Now Sigurd's foster-father was hight Regin, the son of Hreidmar; he
taught him all manner of arts, the chess play, and the lore of runes,
and the talking of many tongues, even as the wont was with kings' sons
in those days. But on a day when they were together, Regin asked Sigurd,
if he knew how much wealth his father had owned, and who had the ward
thereof; Sigurd answered, and said that the kings kept the ward thereof.

Said Regin, "Dost thou trust them all utterly?"

Sigurd said, "It is seemly that they keep it till I may do somewhat
therewith, for better they wot how to guard it than I do."

Another time came Regin to talk to Sigurd, and said--

"A marvellous thing truly that thou must needs be a horse-boy to the
kings, and go about like a running knave."

"Nay," said Sigurd, "it is not so, for in all things I have my will, and
whatso thing I desire is granted me with good will."

"Well, then," said Regin, "ask for a horse of them."

"Yea," quoth Sigurd, "and that shall I have, whenso I have need
thereof."

Thereafter Sigurd went to the king, and the king said--

"What wilt thou have of us?"

Then said Sigurd, "I would even a horse of thee for my disport."

Then said the king, "Choose for thyself a horse, and whatso thing else
thou desirest among my matters."

So the next day went Sigurd to the wood, and met on the way an old man,
long-bearded, that he knew not, who asked him whither away.

Sigurd said, "I am minded to choose me a horse; come thou, and counsel
me thereon."

"Well then," said he, "go we and drive them to the river which is called
Busil-tarn."

They did so, and drave the horses down into the deeps of the river, and
all swam back to land but one horse; and that horse Sigurd chose for
himself; grey he was of hue, and young of years, great of growth, and
fair to look on, nor had any man yet crossed his back.

Then spake the grey-beard, "From Sleipnir's kin is this horse come, and
he must be nourished heedfully, for it will be the best of all horses;"
and therewithal he vanished away.

So Sigurd called the horse Grani, the best of all the horses of the
world; nor was the man he met other than Odin himself.

Now yet again spake Regin to Sigurd, and said--

"Not enough is thy wealth, and I grieve right sore that thou must needs
run here and there like a churl's son; but I can tell thee where there
is much wealth for the winning, and great name and honour to be won in
the getting of it."

Sigurd asked where that might be, and who had watch and ward over it.

Regin answered, "Fafnir is his name, and but a little way hence he lies,
on the waste of Gnita-heath; and when thou comest there thou mayst well
say that thou hast never seen more gold heaped together in one place,
and that none might desire more treasure, though he were the most
ancient and famed of all kings."

"Young am I," says Sigurd, "yet know I the fashion of this worm, and how
that none durst go against him, so huge and evil is he."

Regin said, "Nay it is not so, the fashion and the growth of him is even
as of other lingworms, (1) and an over great tale men make of it; and
even so would thy forefathers have deemed; but thou, though thou be of
the kin of the Volsungs, shalt scarce have the heart and mind of those,
who are told of as the first in all deeds of fame."

Sigurd said, "Yea, belike I have little of their hardihood and prowess,
but thou hast naught to do, to lay a coward's name upon me, when I
am scarce out of my childish years. Why dost thou egg me on hereto so
busily?"

Regin said, "Therein lies a tale which I must needs tell thee."

"Let me hear the same," said Sigurd.

CHAPTER XIV. Regin's tale of his Brothers, and of the Gold called
Andvari's Hoard.

"The tale begins," said Regin. "Hreidmar was my father's name, a mighty
man and a wealthy: and his first son was named Fafnir, his second Otter,
and I was the third, and the least of them all both for prowess and good
conditions, but I was cunning to work in iron, and silver, and gold,
whereof I could make matters that availed somewhat. Other skill my
brother Otter followed, and had another nature withal, for he was a
great fisher, and above other men herein; in that he had the likeness of
an otter by day, and dwelt ever in the river, and bare fish to bank
in his mouth, and his prey would he ever bring to our father, and that
availed him much: for the most part he kept him in his otter-gear, and
then he would come home, and eat alone, and slumbering, for on the
dry land he might see naught. But Fafnir was by far the greatest and
grimmest, and would have all things about called his.

"Now," says Regin, "there was a dwarf called Andvari, who ever abode in
that force, (1) which was called Andvari's force, in the likeness of a
pike, and got meat for himself, for many fish there were in the force;
now Otter, my brother, was ever wont to enter into the force, and bring
fish aland, and lay them one by one on the bank. And so it befell that
Odin, Loki, and Hoenir, as they went their ways, came to Andvari's
force, and Otter had taken a salmon, and ate it slumbering upon the
river bank; then Loki took a stone and cast it at Otter, so that he gat
his death thereby; the gods were well content with their prey, and
fell to flaying off the otter's skin; and in the evening they came to
Hreidmar's house, and showed him what they had taken: thereon he laid
hands on them, and doomed them to such ransom, as that they should fill
the otter skin with gold, and cover it over without with red gold; so
they sent Loki to gather gold together for them; he came to Ran, (2)
and got her net, and went therewith to Andvari's force, and cast the net
before the pike, and the pike ran into the net and was taken. Then said
Loki--

       "'What fish of all fishes,
       Swims strong in the flood,
     But hath learnt little wit to beware?
       Thine head must thou buy,
       From abiding in hell,
     And find me the wan waters flame.'

He answered--

       "'Andvari folk call me,
       Call Oinn my father,
     Over many a force have I fared;
       For a Norn of ill-luck,
       This life on me lay
     Through wet ways ever to wade.'

"So Loki beheld the gold of Andvari, and when he had given up the gold,
he had but one ring left, and that also Loki took from him; then
the dwarf went into a hollow of the rocks, and cried out, that that
gold-ring, yea and all the gold withal, should be the bane of every man
who should own it thereafter.

"Now the gods rode with the treasure to Hreidmar, and fulfilled the
otter-skin, and set it on its feet, and they must cover it over utterly
with gold: but when this was done then Hreidmar came forth, and beheld
yet one of the muzzle hairs, and bade them cover that withal; then Odin
drew the ring, Andvari's loom, from his hand, and covered up the hair
therewith; then sang Loki--

       "'Gold enow, gold enow,
       A great weregild, thou hast,
     That my head in good hap I may hold;
       But thou and thy son
       Are naught fated to thrive,
     The bane shall it be of you both.'

"Thereafter," says Regin, "Fafnir slew his father and murdered him, nor
got I aught of the treasure, and so evil he grew, that he fell to lying
abroad, and begrudged any share in the wealth to any man, and so became
the worst of all worms, and ever now lies brooding upon that treasure:
but for me, I went to the king and became his master-smith; and thus is
the tale told of how I lost the heritage of my father, and the weregild
for my brother."

So spake Regin; but since that time gold is called Ottergild, and for no
other cause than this.

But Sigurd answered, "Much hast thou lost, and exceeding evil have thy
kinsmen been! But now, make a sword by thy craft, such a sword as that
none can be made like unto it; so that I may do great deeds therewith,
if my heart avail thereto, and thou wouldst have me slay this mighty
dragon."

Regin says, "Trust me well herein; and with that same sword shalt thou
slay Fafnir."

CHAPTER XV. Of the Welding together of the Shards of the Sword Gram.

So Regin makes a sword, and gives it into Sigurd's hands. He took the
sword, and said--

"Behold thy smithying, Regin!" and therewith smote it into the anvil,
and the sword brake; so he cast down the brand, and bade him forge a
better.

Then Regin forged another sword, and brought it to Sigurd, who looked
thereon.

Then said Regin, "Belike thou art well content therewith, hard master
though thou be in smithying."

So Sigurd proved the sword, and brake it even as the first; then he said
to Regin--

"Ah, art thou, mayhappen, a traitor and a liar like to those former kin
of thine?"

Therewith he went to his mother, and she welcomed him in seemly wise,
and they talked and drank together.

Then spake Sigurd, "Have I heard aright, that King Sigmund gave thee the
good sword Gram in two pieces?"

"True enough," she said.

So Sigurd said, "Deliver them into my hands, for I would have them."

She said he looked like to win great fame, and gave him the sword.
Therewith went Sigurd to Regin, and bade him make a good sword thereof
as he best might; Regin grew wroth thereat, but went into the smithy
with the pieces of the sword, thinking well meanwhile that Sigurd pushed
his head far enow into the matter of smithying. So he made a sword, and
as he bore it forth from the forge, it seemed to the smiths as though
fire burned along the edges thereof. Now he bade Sigurd take the sword,
and said he knew not how to make a sword if this one failed. Then Sigurd
smote it into the anvil, and cleft it down to the stock thereof, and
neither burst the sword nor brake it. Then he praised the sword much,
and thereafter went to the river with a lock of wool, and threw it up
against the stream, and it fell asunder when it met the sword. Then was
Sigurd glad, and went home.

But Regin said, "Now whereas I have made the sword for thee, belike thou
wilt hold to thy troth given, and wilt go meet Fafnir?"

"Surely will I hold thereto," said Sigurd, "yet first must I avenge my
father."

Now Sigurd the older he grew, the more he grew in the love of all men,
so that every child loved him well.



CHAPTER XVI. The prophecy of Grifir.

There was a man hight Grifir,(1) who was Sigurd's mother's brother, and
a little after the forging of the sword Sigurd went to Grifir, because
he was a man who knew things to come, and what was fated to men: of him
Sigurd asked diligently how his life should go; but Grifir was long
or he spake, yet at the last, by reason of Sigurd's exceeding great
prayers, he told him all his life and the fate thereof, even as
afterwards came to pass. So when Grifir had told him all even as he
would, he went back home; and a little after he and Regin met.

Then said Regin, "Go thou and slay Fafnir, even as thou hast given thy
word."

Sigurd said, "That work shall be wrought; but another is first to be
done, the avenging of Sigmund the king and the other of my kinsmen who
fell in that their last fight."


  ENDNOTES:

CHAPTER XVII. Of Sigurd's Avenging of Sigmund his Father.

Now Sigurd went to the kings, and spake thus--

"Here have I abode a space with you, and I owe you thanks and reward,
for great love and many gifts and all due honour; but now will I away
from the land and go meet the sons of Hunding, and do them to wit that
the Volsungs are not all dead; and your might would I have to strengthen
me therein."

So the kings said that they would give him all things soever that
he desired, and therewith was a great army got ready, and all things
wrought in the most heedful wise, ships and all war-gear, so that his
journey might be of the stateliest: but Sigurd himself steered the
dragon-keel which was the greatest and noblest; richly wrought were
their sails, and glorious to look on.

So they sail and have wind at will; but when a few days were overpast,
there arose a great storm on the sea, and the waves were to behold even
as the foam of men's blood; but Sigurd bade take in no sail, howsoever
they might be riven, but rather to lay on higher than heretofore. But
as they sailed past the rocks of a ness, a certain man hailed the ships,
and asked who was captain over that navy; then was it told him that the
chief and lord was Sigurd, the son of Sigmund, the most famed of all the
young men who now are.

Then said the man, "Naught but one thing, certes, do all say of him, that
none among the sons of kings may be likened unto him; now fain were I
that ye would shorten sail on some of the ships, and take me aboard."

Then they asked him of his name, and he sang--

     "Hnikar I hight,
     When I gladdened Huginn,
     And went to battle,
     Bright son of Volsung;
     Now may ye call
     The carl on the cliff top,
     Feng or Fjolnir:
     Fain would I with you."

They made for land therewith, and took that man aboard.

Then quoth Sigurd,(1) as the song says--

       "Tell me this, O Hnikar,
       Since full well thou knowest
     Fate of Gods, good and ill of mankind,
       What best our hap foresheweth,
       When amid the battle
     About us sweeps the sword edge."

Quoth Hnikar--

       "Good are many tokens
       If thereof men wotted
     When the swords are sweeping:
       Fair fellow deem I
       The dark-winged raven,
     In war, to weapon-wielder.

       "The second good thing:
       When abroad thou goest
     For the long road well arrayed,
       Good if thou seest
       Two men standing,
     Fain of fame within the forecourt.

       "A third thing:
       Good hearing,
       The wolf a howling
     Abroad under ash boughs;
       Good hap shalt thou have
       Dealing with helm-staves,
     If thou seest these fare before thee.

       "No man in fight
       His face shall turn
       Against the moon's sister
       Low, late-shining,
       For he winneth battle
       Who best beholdeth
       Through the midmost sword-play,
       And the sloping ranks best shapeth.

       "Great is the trouble
       Of foot ill-tripping,
     When arrayed for fight thou farest,
       For on both sides about
       Are the D?sir (2) by thee,
     Guileful, wishful of thy wounding.

       "Fair-combed, well washen
       Let each warrior be,
     Nor lack meat in the morning,
       For who can rule
       The eve's returning,
     And base to fall before fate grovelling."

Then the storm abated, and on they fared till they came aland in the
realm of Hunding's sons, and then Fjolnir vanished away.

Then they let loose fire and sword, and slew men and burnt their abodes,
and did waste all before them: a great company of folk fled before the
face of them to Lyngi the King, and tell him that men of war are in the
land, and are faring with such rage and fury that the like has never
been heard of; and that the sons of King Hunding had no great forecast
in that they said they would never fear the Volsungs more, for here was
come Sigurd, the son of Sigmund, as captain over this army.

So King Lyngi let send the war-message all throughout his realm, and has
no will to flee, but summons to him all such as would give him aid. So
he came against Sigurd with a great army, he and his brothers with him,
and an exceeding fierce fight befell; many a spear and many an arrow
might men see there raised aloft, axes hard driven, shields cleft and
byrnies torn, helmets were shivered, skulls split atwain, and many a man
felled to the cold earth.

And now when the fight has long dured in such wise, Sigurd goes forth
before the banners, and has the good sword Gram in his hand, and smites
down both men and horses, and goes through the thickest of the throng
with both arms red with blood to the shoulder; and folk shrank aback
before him wheresoever he went, nor would either helm or byrny hold
before him, and no man deemed he had ever seen his like. So a long while
the battle lasted, and many a man was slain, and furious was the onset;
till at last it befell, even as seldom comes to hand, when a land army
falls on, that, do whatso they might, naught was brought about; but so
many men fell of the sons of Hunding that the tale of them may not be
told; and now whenas Sigurd was among the foremost, came the sons of
Hunding against him, and Sigurd smote therewith at Lyngi the king, and
clave him down, both helm and head, and mail-clad body, and thereafter
he smote Hjorward his brother atwain, and then slew all the other sons
of Hunding who were yet alive, and the more part of their folk withal.

Now home goes Sigurd with fair victory won, and plenteous wealth and
great honour, which he had gotten to him in this journey, and feasts
were made for him against he came back to the realm.

But when Sigurd had been at home but a little, came Regin to talk with
him, and said--

"Belike thou wilt now have good will to bow down Fafnir's crest
according to thy word plighted, since thou hast thus revenged thy father
and the others of thy kin."

Sigurd answered, "That will we hold to, even as we have promised, nor
did it ever fall from our memory."

CHAPTER XVIII. Of the Slaying of the Worm Fafnir.

Now Sigurd and Regin ride up the heath along that same way wherein
Fafnir was wont to creep when he fared to the water; and folk say that
thirty fathoms was the height of that cliff along which he lay when he
drank of the water below. Then Sigurd spake:

"How sayedst thou, Regin, that this drake (1) was no greater than other
lingworms; methinks the track of him is marvellous great?"

Then said Regin, "Make thee a hole, and sit down therein, and whenas
the worm comes to the water, smite him into the heart, and so do him to
death, and win thee great fame thereby."

But Sigurd said, "What will betide me if I be before the blood of the
worm?"

Says Regin, "Of what avail to counsel thee if thou art still afeard of
everything? Little art thou like thy kin in stoutness of heart."

Then Sigurd rides right over the heath; but Regin gets him gone, sore
afeard.

But Sigurd fell to digging him a pit, and whiles he was at that work,
there came to him an old man with a long beard, and asked what he
wrought there, and he told him.

Then answered the old man and said, "Thou doest after sorry counsel:
rather dig thee many pits, and let the blood run therein; but sit thee
down in one thereof, and so thrust the worm's heart through."

And therewithal he vanished away; but Sigurd made the pits even as it
was shown to him.

Now crept the worm down to his place of watering, and the earth shook
all about him, and he snorted forth venom on all the way before him as
he went; but Sigurd neither trembled nor was adrad at the roaring of
him. So whenas the worm crept over the pits, Sigurd thrust his sword
under his left shoulder, so that it sank in up to the hilts; then up
leapt Sigurd from the pit and drew the sword back again unto him, and
therewith was his arm all bloody, up to the very shoulder.

Now when that mighty worm was ware that he had his death-wound, then he
lashed out head and tail, so that all things soever that were before him
were broken to pieces.

So whenas Fafnir had his death-wound, he asked "Who art thou? And who is
thy father? And what thy kin, that thou wert so hardy as to bear weapons
against me?"

Sigurd answered, "Unknown to men is my kin. I am called a noble beast:
(2) neither father have I nor mother, and all alone have I fared
hither."

Said Fafnir, "Whereas thou hast neither father nor mother, of what
wonder wert thou born then? But now, though thou tellest me not thy name
on this my death-day, yet thou knowest verily that thou liest unto me."

He answered, "Sigurd am I called, and my father was Sigmund."

Says Fafnir, "Who egged thee on to this deed, and why wouldst thou be
driven to it? Hadst thou never heard how that all folk were adrad of
me, and of the awe of my countenance? But an eager father thou hadst, O
bright eyed swain!"

Sigurd answered, "A hardy heart urged me on hereto; and a strong hand
and this sharp sword, which well thou knowest now, stood me in stead in
the doing of the deed; 'Seldom hath hardy eld a faint-heart youth.'"

Fafnir said, "Well, I wot that hadst thou waxed amid thy kin, thou
mightest have good skill to slay folk in thine anger; but more of a
marvel is it, that thou, a bondsman taken in war, shouldst have the
heart to set on me, 'for few among bondsmen have heart for the fight.'"

Said Sigurd, "Wilt thou then cast it in my teeth that I am far away from
my kin? Albeit I was a bondsman, yet was I never shackled. God wot thou
hast found me free enow."

Fafnir answered, "In angry wise dost thou take my speech; but hearken,
for that same gold which I have owned shall be thy bane too."

Quoth Sigurd, "Fain would we keep all our wealth til that day of days;
yet shall each man die once for all."

Said Fafnir, "Few things wilt thou do after my counsel; but take heed
that thou shalt be drowned if thou farest unwarily over the sea; so bide
thou rather on the dry land, for the coming of the calm tide."

Then said Sigurd, "Speak, Fafnir, and say, if thou art so exceeding
wise, who are the Norns who rule the lot of all mothers' sons."

Fafnir answers, "Many there be and wide apart; for some are of the kin
of the Aesir, and some are of Elfin kin, and some there are who are
daughters of Dvalin."

Said Sigurd, "How namest thou the holm whereon Surt (3) and the Aesir
mix and mingle the water of the sword?"

"Unshapen is that holm hight," said Fafnir.

And yet again he said, "Regin, my brother, has brought about my end,
and it gladdens my heart that thine too he bringeth about; for thus will
things be according to his will."

And once again he spake, "A countenance of terror I bore up before all
folk, after that I brooded over the heritage of my brother, and on every
side did I spout out poison, so that none durst come anigh me, and of
no weapon was I adrad, nor ever had I so many men before me, as that
I deemed myself not stronger than all; for all men were sore afeard of
me."

Sigurd answered and said, "Few may have victory by means of that same
countenance of terror, for whoso comes amongst many shall one day find
that no one man is by so far the mightiest of all."

Then says Fafnir, "Such counsel I give thee, that thou take thy horse
and ride away at thy speediest, for ofttimes it falls out so, that he
who gets a death-wound avenges himself none the less."

Sigurd answered, "Such as thy redes are I will nowise do after them;
nay, I will ride now to thy lair and take to me that great treasure of
thy kin."

"Ride there then," said Fafnir, "and thou shalt find gold enow to
suffice thee for all thy life-days; yet shall that gold be thy bane, and
the bane of every one soever who owns it."

Then up stood Sigurd, and said, "Home would I ride and lose all that
wealth, if I deemed that by the losing thereof I should never die; but
every brave and true man will fain have his hand on wealth till that
last day; but thou, Fafnir, wallow in the death-pain till Death and Hell
have thee."

And therewithal Fafnir died.

CHAPTER XIX. Of the Slaying of Regin, Son of Hreidmar.

Thereafter came Regin to Sigurd, and said, "Hail, lord and master, a
noble victory hast thou won in the slaying of Fafnir, whereas none durst
heretofore abide in the path of him; and now shall this deed of fame be
of renown while the world stands fast."

Then stood Regin staring on the earth a long while, and presently
thereafter spake from heavy mood: "Mine own brother hast thou slain, and
scarce may I be called sackless of the deed."

Then Sigurd took his sword Gram and dried it on the earth, and spake to
Regin--

"Afar thou faredst when I wrought this deed and tried this sharp sword
with the hand and the might of me; with all the might and main of a
dragon must I strive, while thou wert laid alow in the heather-bush,
wotting not if it were earth or heaven."

Said Regin, "Long might this worm have lain in his lair, if the sharp
sword I forged with my hand had not been good at need to thee; had that
not been, neither thou nor any man would have prevailed against him as
at this time."

Sigurd answers, "Whenas men meet foes in fight, better is stout heart
than sharp sword."

Then said Regin, exceeding heavily, "Thou hast slain my brother, and
scarce may I be sackless of the deed."

Therewith Sigurd cut out the heart of the worm with the sword called
Ridil; but Regin drank of Fafnir's blood, and spake, "Grant me a boon,
and do a thing little for thee to do. Bear the heart to the fire, and
roast it, and give me thereof to eat."

Then Sigurd went his ways and roasted it on a rod; and when the blood
bubbled out he laid his finger thereon to essay it, if it were fully
done; and then he set his finger in his mouth, and lo, when the
heart-blood of the worm touched his tongue, straightway he knew the
voice of all fowls, and heard withal how the wood-peckers chattered in
the brake beside him--

"There sittest thou, Sigurd, roasting Fafnir's heart for another, that
thou shouldest eat thine ownself, and then thou shouldest become the
wisest of all men."

And another spake: "There lies Regin, minded to beguile the man who
trusts in him."

But yet again said the third, "Let him smite the head from off him then,
and be only lord of all that gold."

And once more the fourth spake and said, "Ah, the wiser were he if he
followed after that good counsel, and rode thereafter to Fafnir's lair,
and took to him that mighty treasure that lieth there, and then rode
over Hindfell, whereas sleeps Brynhild; for there would he get great
wisdom. Ah, wise he were, if he did after your redes, and bethought him
of his own weal; 'for where wolf's ears are, wolf's teeth are near.'"

Then cried the fifth: "Yea, yea, not so wise is he as I deem him, if he
spareth him, whose brother he hath slain already."

At last spake the sixth: "Handy and good rede to slay him, and be lord
of the treasure!"

Then said Sigurd, "The time is unborn wherein Regin shall be my bane;
nay, rather one road shall both these brothers fare."

And therewith he drew his sword Gram and struck off Regin's head.

Then heard Sigurd the wood-peckers a-singing, even as the song says. (1)

For the first sang:

     "Bind thou, Sigurd,
     The bright red rings!
     Not meet it is
     Many things to fear.
     A fair may know I,
     Fair of all the fairest
     Girt about with gold,
     Good for thy getting."

And the second:

     "Green go the ways
     Toward the hall of Giuki
     That the fates show forth
     To those who fare thither;
     There the rich king
     Reareth a daughter;
     Thou shalt deal, Sigurd,
     With gold for thy sweetling."

And the third:

     "A high hall is there
     Reared upon Hindfell,
     Without all around it
     Sweeps the red flame aloft.
     Wise men wrought
     That wonder of halls
     With the unhidden gleam
     Of the glory of gold."

Then the fourth sang:

     "Soft on the fell
     A shield-may sleepeth
     The lime-trees' red plague
     Playing about her:
     The sleep-thorn set Odin
     Into that maiden
     For her choosing in war
     The one he willed not.

     "Go, son, behold
     That may under helm
     Whom from battle
     Vinskornir bore,
     From her may not turn
     The torment of sleep.
     Dear offspring of kings
     In the dread Norns' despite."

Then Sigurd ate some deal of Fafnir's heart, and the remnant he kept.
Then he leapt on his horse and rode along the trail of the worm Fafnir,
and so right unto his abiding-place; and he found it open, and beheld
all the doors and the gear of them that they were wrought of iron: yea,
and all the beams of the house; and it was dug down deep into the earth:
there found Sigurd gold exceeding plenteous, and the sword Rotti; and
thence he took the Helm of Awe, and the Gold Byrny, and many things
fair and good. So much gold he found there, that he thought verily that
scarce might two horses, or three belike, bear it thence. So he took
all the gold and laid it in two great chests, and set them on the horse
Grani, and took the reins of him, but nowise will he stir, neither will
he abide smiting. Then Sigurd knows the mind of the horse, and leaps on
the back of him, and smites and spurs into him, and off the horse goes
even as if he were unladen.

CHAPTER XX. Of Sigurd's Meeting with Brynhild on the Mountain.

By long roads rides Sigurd, till he comes at the last up on to Hindfell,
and wends his way south to the land of the Franks; and he sees before
him on the fell a great light, as of fire burning, and flaming up even
unto the heavens; and when he came thereto, lo, a shield-hung castle
before him, and a banner on the topmost thereof: into the castle went
Sigurd, and saw one lying there asleep, and all-armed. Therewith he
takes the helm from off the head of him, and sees that it is no man, but
a woman; and she was clad in a byrny as closely set on her as though it
had grown to her flesh; so he rent it from the collar downwards; and then
the sleeves thereof, and ever the sword bit on it as if it were cloth.
Then said Sigurd that over-long had she lain asleep; but she asked--

"What thing of great might is it that has prevailed to rend my byrny,
and draw me from my sleep?"

Even as sings the song: (1)

     "What bit on the byrny,
     Why breaks my sleep away,
     Who has turned from me
     My wan tormenting?"

"Ah, is it so, that here is come Sigurd Sigmundson, bearing Fafnir's
helm on his head and Fafnir's bane in his hand?"

Then answered Sigurd--

     "Sigmund's son
     With Sigurd's sword
     E'en now rent down
     The raven's wall."

"Of the Volsung's kin is he who has done the deed; but now I have heard
that thou art daughter of a mighty king, and folk have told us that thou
wert lovely and full of lore, and now I will try the same."

Then Brynhild sang--

     "Long have I slept
     And slumbered long,
     Many and long are the woes of mankind,
     By the might of Odin
     Must I bide helpless
     To shake from off me the spells of slumber.

     "Hail to the day come back!
     Hail, sons of the daylight!
     Hail to thee, dark night, and thy daughter!
     Look with kind eyes a-down,
     On us sitting here lonely,
     And give unto us the gain that we long for.

     "Hail to the Aesir,
     And the sweet Asyniur! (2)
     Hail to the fair earth fulfilled of plenty!
     Fair words, wise hearts,
     Would we win from you,
     And healing hands while life we hold."

Then Brynhild speaks again and says, "Two kings fought, one hight Helm
Gunnar, an old man, and the greatest of warriors, and Odin had promised
the victory unto him; but his foe was Agnar, or Audi's brother: and so
I smote down Helm Gunnar in the fight; and Odin, in vengeance for that
deed, stuck the sleep-thorn into me, and said that I should never
again have the victory, but should be given away in marriage; but
thereagainst I vowed a vow, that never would I wed one who knew the
name of fear."

Then said Sigurd, "Teach us the lore of mighty matters!"

She said, "Belike thou cannest more skill in all than I; yet will I
teach thee; yea, and with thanks, if there be aught of my cunning that
will in anywise pleasure thee, either of runes or of other matters that
are the root of things; but now let us drink together, and may the Gods
give to us twain a good day, that thou mayst win good help and fame
from my wisdom, and that thou mayst hereafter mind thee of that which we
twain speak together."

Then Brynhild filled a beaker and bore it to Sigurd, and gave him the
drink of love, and spake--

       "Beer bring I to thee,
       Fair fruit of the byrnies' clash,
       Mixed is it mightily,
       Mingled with fame,
       Brimming with bright lays
       And pitiful runes,
       Wise words, sweet words,
       Speech of great game.

       "Runes of war know thou,
       If great thou wilt be!
     Cut them on hilt of hardened sword,
       Some on the brand's back,
       Some on its shining side,
     Twice name Tyr therein.

       "Sea-runes good at need,
       Learnt for ship's saving,
     For the good health of the swimming horse;
       On the stern cut them,
       Cut them on the rudder-blade
     And set flame to shaven oar:
       Howso big be the sea-hills,
       Howso blue beneath,
     Hail from the main then comest thou home.

       "Word-runes learn well
       If thou wilt that no man
     Pay back grief for the grief thou gavest;
       Wind thou these,
       Weave thou these,
     Cast thou these all about thee,
       At the Thing,
       Where folk throng,
     Unto the full doom faring.

       "Of ale-runes know the wisdom
       If thou wilt that another's wife
     Should not bewray thine heart that trusteth:
       Cut them on the mead-horn,
       On the back of each hand,
     And nick an N upon thy nail.

       "Ale have thou heed
       To sign from all harm
     Leek lay thou in the liquor,
       Then I know for sure
       Never cometh to thee,
     Mead with hurtful matters mingled.

       "Help-runes shalt thou gather
       If skill thou wouldst gain
     To loosen child from low-laid mother;
       Cut be they in hands hollow,
       Wrapped the joints round about;
     Call for the Good-folks' gainsome helping.

       "Learn the bough-runes wisdom
       If leech-lore thou lovest;
     And wilt wot about wounds' searching
       On the bark be they scored;
       On the buds of trees
     Whose boughs look eastward ever.

       "Thought-runes shalt thou deal with
       If thou wilt be of all men
     Fairest-souled wight, and wisest,
       These areded
       These first cut
     These first took to heart high Hropt.

     "On the shield were they scored
     That stands before the shining God,
     On Early-waking's ear,
     On All-knowing's hoof,
     On the wheel which runneth
     Under Rognir's chariot;
     On Sleipnir's jaw-teeth,
     On the sleigh's traces.

     "On the rough bear's paws,
     And on Bragi's tongue,
     On the wolf's claws,
     And on eagle's bill,
     On bloody wings,
     And bridge's end;
     On loosing palms,
     And pity's path:

     "On glass, and on gold,
     And on goodly silver,
     In wine and in wort,
     And the seat of the witch-wife;
     On Gungnir's point,
     And Grani's bosom;
     On the Norn's nail,
     And the neb of the night-owl.

       "All these so cut,
       Were shaven and sheared,
     And mingled in with holy mead,
     And sent upon wide ways enow;
       Some abide with the Elves,
       Some abide with the Aesir,
     Or with the wise Vanir,
     Some still hold the sons of mankind.

       "These be the book-runes,
       And the runes of good help,
     And all the ale-runes,
     And the runes of much might;
       To whomso they may avail,
       Unbewildered unspoilt;
     They are wholesome to have:
     Thrive thou with these then.
     When thou hast learnt their lore,
     Till the Gods end thy life-days.

       "Now shalt thou choose thee
       E'en as choice is bidden,
     Sharp steel's root and stem,
       Choose song or silence;
       See to each in thy heart,
     All hurt has been heeded."

Then answered Sigurd--

     "Ne'er shall I flee,
     Though thou wottest me fey;
     Never was I born for blenching,
     Thy loved rede will I
       Hold aright in my heart
     Even as long as I may live."

CHAPTER XXI. More Wise Words of Brynhild.

Sigurd spake now, "Sure no wiser woman than thou art one may be found in
the wide world; yea, yea, teach me more yet of thy wisdom!"

She answers, "Seemly is it that I do according to thy will, and show
thee forth more redes of great avail, for thy prayer's sake and thy
wisdom;" and she spake withal--

"Be kindly to friend and kin, and reward not their trespasses against
thee; bear and forbear, and win for thee thereby long enduring praise of
men.

"Take good heed of evil things: a may's love, and a man's wife; full oft
thereof doth ill befall!

"Let not thy mind be overmuch crossed by unwise men at thronged meetings
of folk; for oft these speak worse than they wot of; lest thou be called
a dastard, and art minded to think that thou art even as is said; slay
such an one on another day, and so reward his ugly talk.

"If thou farest by the way whereas bide evil things, be well ware of
thyself; take not harbour near the highway, though thou be benighted,
for oft abide there ill wights for men's bewilderment.

"Let not fair women beguile thee, such as thou mayst meet at the feast,
so that the thought thereof stand thee in stead of sleep, and a quiet
mind; yea, draw them not to thee with kisses or other sweet things of
love.

"If thou hearest the fool's word of a drunken man, strive not with him
being drunk with drink and witless; many a grief, yea, and the very
death, groweth from out such things.

"Fight thy foes in the field, nor be burnt in thine house.

'Never swear thou wrongsome oath; great and grim is the reward for the
breaking of plighted troth.

"Give kind heed to dead men,--sick-dead, Sea-dead; deal heedfully with
their dead corpses.

"Trow never in him for whom thou hast slain father, brother, or whatso
near kin, yea, though young he be; 'for oft waxes wolf in youngling'.

"Look thou with good heed to the wiles of thy friends; but little skill
is given to me, that I should foresee the ways of thy life; yet good it
were that hate fell not on thee from those of thy wife's house."

Sigurd spake, "None among the sons of men can be found wiser than thou;
and thereby swear I, that thee will I have as my own, for near to my
heart thou liest."

She answers, "Thee would I fainest choose, though I had all men's sons
to choose from."

And thereto they plighted troth both of them.



CHAPTER XXII. Of the Semblance and Array of Sigurd Fafnir's-bane. (1)

Now Sigurd rides away; many-folded is his shield, and blazing with red
gold, and the image of a dragon is drawn thereon; and this same was dark
brown above, and bright red below; and with even such-like image was
adorned helm, and saddle, and coat-armour; and he was clad in the golden
byrny, and all his weapons were gold wrought.

Now for this cause was the drake drawn on all his weapons, that when he
was seen of men, all folk might know who went there; yea, all those who
had heard of his slaying of that great dragon, that the Voerings call
Fafnir; and for that cause are his weapons gold-wrought, and brown
of hue, and that he was by far above other men in courtesy and goodly
manners, and well-nigh in all things else; and whenas folk tell of all
the mightiest champions, and the noblest chiefs, then ever is he named
the foremost, and his name goes wide about on all tongues north of the
sea of the Greek-lands, and even so shall it be while the world endures.

Now the hair of this Sigurd was golden-red of hue, fair of fashion, and
falling down in great locks; thick and short was his beard, and of no
other colour, high-nosed he was, broad and high-boned of face; so
keen were his eyes, that few durst gaze up under the brows of him; his
shoulders were as broad to look on as the shoulders of two; most duly
was his body fashioned betwixt height and breadth, and in such wise as
was seemliest; and this is the sign told of his height, that when he was
girt with his sword Gram, which same was seven spans long, as he went
through the full-grown rye-fields, the dew-shoe of the said sword smote
the ears of the standing corn; and, for all that, greater was his
strength than his growth: well could he wield sword, and cast forth
spear, shoot shaft, and hold shield, bend bow, back horse, and do all
the goodly deeds that he learned in his youth's days.

Wise he was to know things yet undone; and the voice of all fowls he
knew, wherefore few things fell on him unawares.

Of many words he was, and so fair of speech withal, that whensoever he
made it his business to speak, he never left speaking before that to all
men it seemed full sure, that no otherwise must the matter be than as he
said.

His sport and pleasure it was to give aid to his own folk, and to prove
himself in mighty matters, to take wealth from his unfriends, and give
the same to his friends.

Never did he lose heart, and of naught was he adrad.

       the "Wilkinasaga"; Ed.: Perinskiold, Stockholm, 1715.



CHAPTER XXIII. Sigurd comes to Hlymdale.

Forth Sigurd rides till he comes to a great and goodly dwelling, the
lord whereof was a mighty chief called Heimir; he had to wife a sister
of Brynhild, who was hight Bekkhild, because she had bidden at home, and
learned handicraft, whereas Brynhild fared with helm and byrny unto the
wars, wherefore was she called Brynhild.

Heimir and Bekkhild had a son called Alswid, the most courteous of men.

Now at this stead were men disporting them abroad, but when they see
the man riding thereto, they leave their play to wonder at him, for none
such had they ever seen erst; so they went to meet him, and gave him
good welcome; Alswid bade him abide and have such things at his hands as
he would; and he takes his bidding blithesomely; due service withal was
established for him; four men bore the treasure of gold from off the
horse, and the fifth took it to him to guard the same; therein were many
things to behold, things of great price, and seldom seen; and great
game and joy men had to look on byrnies and helms, and mighty rings, and
wondrous great golden stoups, and all kinds of war weapons.

So there dwelt Sigurd long in great honour holden; and tidings of that
deed of fame spread wide through all lands, of how he had slain that
hideous and fearful dragon. So good joyance had they there together,
and each was leal to other; and their sport was in the arraying of
their weapons, and the shafting of their arrows, and the flying of their
falcons.



CHAPTER XXIV. Sigurd sees Brynhild at Hlymdale.

In those days came home to Heimir, Brynhild, his foster-daughter,
and she sat in her bower with her maidens, and could more skill in
handycraft than other women; she sat, overlaying cloth with gold, and
sewing therein the great deeds which Sigurd had wrought, the slaying of
the Worm, and the taking of the wealth of him, and the death of Regin
withal.

Now tells the tale, that on a day Sigurd rode into the wood with hawk,
and hound, and men thronging; and whenas he came home his hawk flew up
to a high tower, and sat him down on a certain window. Then fared Sigurd
after his hawk, and he saw where sat a fair woman, and knew that it was
Brynhild, and he deems all things he sees there to be worthy together,
both her fairness, and the fair things she wrought: and therewith he
goes into the hall, but has no more joyance in the games of the men
folk.

Then spake Alswid, "Why art thou so bare of bliss? this manner of thine
grieveth us thy friends; why then wilt thou not hold to thy gleesome
ways? Lo, thy hawks pine now, and thy horse Grani droops; and long will
it be ere we are booted thereof?"

Sigurd answered, "Good friend, hearken to what lies on my mind; for my
hawk flew up into a certain tower; and when I came thereto and took him,
lo there I saw a fair woman, and she sat by a needlework of gold, and
did thereon my deeds that are passed, and my deeds that are to come."

Then said Alswid, "Thou has seen Brynhild, Budli's daughter, the
greatest of great women."

"Yea, verily," said Sigurd; "but how came she hither?"

Aswid answered, "Short space there was betwixt the coming hither of the
twain of you."

Says Sigurd, "Yea, but a few days agone I knew her for the best of the
world's women."

Alswid said, "Give not all thine heed to one woman, being such a man as
thou art; ill life to sit lamenting for what we may not have."

"I shall go meet her," says Sigurd, "and get from her love like my love,
and give her a gold ring in token thereof."

Alswid answered, "None has ever yet been known whom she would let sit
beside her, or to whom she would give drink; for ever will she hold to
warfare and to the winning of all kinds of fame."

Sigurd said, "We know not for sure whether she will give us answer or
not, or grant us a seat beside her."

So the next day after, Sigurd went to the bower, but Alswid stood
outside the bower door, fitting shafts to his arrows.

Now Sigurd spake, "Abide, fair and hale lady,--how farest thou?"

She answered, "Well it fares; my kin and my friends live yet: but who
shall say what goodhap folk may bear to their life's end?"

He sat him down by her, and there came in four damsels with great golden
beakers, and the best of wine therein; and these stood before the twain.

Then said Brynhild, "This seat is for few, but and if my father come."

He answered, "Yet is it granted to one that likes me well."

Now that chamber was hung with the best and fairest of hangings, and the
floor thereof was all covered with cloth.

Sigurd spake, "Now has it come to pass even as thou didst promise."

"O be thou welcome here!" said she, and arose therewith, and the four
damsels with her, and bore the golden beaker to him, and bade him drink;
he stretched out his hand to the beaker, and took it, and her hand
withal, and drew her down beside him; and cast his arms round about her
neck and kissed her, and said--

"Thou art the fairest that was ever born!"

But Brynhild said, "Ah, wiser is it not to cast faith and troth into a
woman's power, for ever shall they break that they have promised."

He said, "That day would dawn the best of days over our heads whereon
each of each should be made happy."

Brynhild answered, "It is not fated that we should abide together; I am
a shield-may, and wear helm on head even as the kings of war, and them
full oft I help, neither is the battle become loathsome to me."

Sigurd answered, "What fruit shall be of our life, if we live not
together: harder to bear this pain that lies hereunder, than the stroke
of sharp sword."

Brynhild answers, "I shall gaze on the hosts of the war-kings, but thou
shalt wed Gudrun, the daughter of Giuki."

Sigurd answered, "What king's daughter lives to beguile me? neither am
I double-hearted herein; and now I swear by the Gods that thee shall I
have for mine own, or no woman else."

And even suchlike wise spake she.

Sigurd thanked her for her speech, and gave her a gold ring, and now
they swore oath anew, and so he went his ways to his men, and is with
them awhile in great bliss.



CHAPTER XXV. Of the Dream of Gudrun, Giuki's daughter.

There was a king hight Giuki, who ruled a realm south of the Rhine;
three sons he had, thus named: Gunnar, Hogni, and Guttorm, and Gudrun
was the name of his daughter, the fairest of maidens; and all these
children were far before all other king's children in all prowess, and
in goodliness and growth withal; ever were his sons at the wars
and wrought many a deed of fame. But Giuki had wedded Grimhild the
Wise-wife.

Now Budli was the name of a king mightier than Giuki, mighty though they
both were: and Atli was the brother of Brynhild: Atli was a fierce man
and a grim, great and black to look on, yet noble of mien withal, and
the greatest of warriors. Grimhild was a fierce-hearted woman.

Now the days of the Giukings bloomed fair, and chiefly because of those
children, so far before the sons of men.

On a day Gudrun says to her mays that she may have no joy of heart; then
a certain woman asked her wherefore her joy was departed.

She answered, "Grief came to me in my dreams, therefore is there sorrow
in my heart, since thou must needs ask thereof."

"Tell it me, then, thy dream," said the woman, "for dreams oft forecast
but the weather."

Gudrun answers, "Nay, nay, no weather is this; I dreamed that I had a
fair hawk on my wrist, feathered with feathers of gold."

Says the woman, "Many have heard tell of thy beauty, thy wisdom, and thy
courtesy; some king's son abides thee, then."

Gudrun answers, "I dreamed that naught was so dear to me as this hawk,
and all my wealth had I cast aside rather than him."

The woman said, "Well, then, the man thou shalt have will be of the
goodliest, and well shalt thou love him."

Gudrun answered, "It grieves me that I know not who he shall be; let us
go seek Brynhild, for she belike will wot thereof."

So they arrayed them in gold and many a fair thing, and she went with
her damsels till they came to the hall of Brynhild, and that hall was
dight with gold, and stood on a high hill; and whenas their goings were
seen, it was told Brynhild, that a company of women drove toward the
burg in gilded waggons.

"That shall be Gudrun, Giuki's daughter," says she: "I dreamed of her
last night; let us go meet her! No fairer woman may come to our house."

So they went abroad to meet them, and gave them good greeting, and they
went into the goodly hall together; fairly painted it was within, and
well adorned with silver vessel; cloths were spread under the feet of
them, and all folk served them, and in many wise they sported.

But Gudrun was somewhat silent.

Then said Brynhild, "Ill to abash folk of their mirth; prithee do not
so; let us talk together for our disport of mighty kings and their great
deeds."

"Good talk," says Gudrun, "let us do even so; what kings deemest thou to
have been the first of all men?"

Brynhild says, "The sons of Haki, and Hagbard withal; they brought to
pass many a deed of fame in the warfare."

Gudrun answers, "Great men certes, and of noble fame! Yet Sigar took
their one sister, and burned the other, house and all; and they may be
called slow to revenge the deed; why didst thou not name my brethren, who
are held to be the first of men as at this time?"

Brynhild says, "Men of good hope are they surely, though but little
proven hitherto; but one I know far before them, Sigurd, the son of
Sigmund the king; a youngling was he in the days when he slew the sons
of Hunding, and revenged his father, and Eylimi, his mother's father."

Said Gudrun, "By what token tellest thou that?"

Brynhild answered, "His mother went amid the dead, and found Sigmund the
king sore wounded, and would bind up his hurts; but he said he grew over
old for war, and bade her lay this comfort to her heart, that she should
bear the most famed of sons; and wise was the wise man's word therein:
for after the death of King Sigmund, she went to King Alf, and there was
Sigurd nourished in great honour, and day by day he wrought some deed of
fame, and is the man most renowned of all the wide world."

Gudrun says, "From love hast thou gained these tidings of him; but for
this cause came I here, to tell thee dreams of mine which have brought
me great grief."

Says Brynhild, "Let not such matters sadden thee; abide with thy friends
who wish thee blithesome, all of them!"

"This I dreamed," said Gudrun, "that we went, a many of us in company,
from the bower, and we saw an exceeding great hart, that far excelled
all other deer ever seen, and the hair of him was golden; and this
deer we were all fain to take, but I alone got him; and he seemed to me
better than all things else; but sithence thou, Byrnhild, didst shoot
and slay my deer even at my very knees, and such grief was that to
me that scarce might I bear it; and then afterwards thou gavest me a
wolf-cub, which besprinkled me with the blood of my brethren."

Brynhild answers, "I will arede thy dream, even as things shall come
to pass hereafter; for Sigurd shall come to thee, even he whom I have
chosen for my well-beloved; and Grimhild shall give him mead mingled
with hurtful things, which shall cast us all into mighty strife. Him
shalt thou have, and him shalt thou quickly miss; and Atli the king
shalt thou wed; and thy brethren shalt thou lose, and slay Atli withal
in the end."

Gudrun answers, "Grief and woe to know that such things shall be!"

And therewith she and hers get them gone home to King Giuki.



CHAPTER XXVI. Sigurd comes to the Giukings and is wedded to Gudrun.

Now Sigurd goes his ways with all that great treasure, and in friendly
wise he departs from them; and on Grani he rides with all his war-gear
and the burden withal; and thus he rides until he comes to the hall
of King Giuki; there he rides into the burg, and that sees one of the
king's men, and he spake withal--

"Sure it may be deemed that here is come one of the Gods, for his array
is all done with gold, and his horse is far mightier than other horses,
and the manner of his weapons is most exceeding goodly, and most of all
the man himself far excels all other men ever seen."

So the king goes out with his court and greets the man, and asks--

"Who art thou who thus ridest into my burg, as none has durst hitherto
without the leave of my sons?"

He answered, "I am called Sigurd, son of King Sigmund."

Then said King Giuki, "Be thou welcome here then, and take at our hands
whatso thou willest."

So he went into the king's hall, and all men seemed little beside him,
and all men served him, and there he abode in great joyance.

Now oft they all ride abroad together, Sigurd and Gunnar and Hogni,
and ever is Sigurd far the foremost of them, mighty men of their hands
though they were.

But Grimhild finds how heartily Sigurd loved Brynhild, and how oft he
talks of her; and she falls to thinking how well it were, if he might
abide there and wed the daughter of King Giuki, for she saw that none
might come anigh to his goodliness, and what faith and goodhelp there
was in him, and how that he had more wealth withal than folk might tell
of any man; and the king did to him even as unto his own sons, and they
for their parts held him of more worth than themselves.

So on a night as they sat at the drink, the queen arose, and went before
Sigurd, and said--

"Great joy we have in thine abiding here, and all good things will
we put before thee to take of us; lo now, take this horn and drink
thereof."

So he took it and drank, and therewithal she said, "Thy father shall be
Giuki the king, and I shall be thy mother, and Gunnar and Hogni shall be
thy brethren, and all this shall be sworn with oaths each to each; and
then surely shall the like of you never be found on earth."

Sigurd took her speech well, for with the drinking of that drink all
memory of Brynhild departed from him. So there he abode awhile.

And on a day went Grimhild to Giuki the king, and cast her arms about
his neck, and spake--

"Behold, there has now come to us the greatest of great hearts that the
world holds; and needs must he be trusty and of great avail; give him
thy daughter then, with plenteous wealth, and as much of rule as he
will; perchance thereby he will be well content to abide here ever."

The king answered, "Seldom does it befall that kings offer their
daughters to any; yet in higher wise will it be done to offer her to
this man, than to take lowly prayers for her from others."

On a night Gudrun pours out the drink, and Sigurd beholds her how fair
she is and how full of all courtesy.

Five seasons Sigurd abode there, and ever they passed their days
together in good honour and friendship.

And so it befell that the kings held talk together, and Giuki said --

"Great good thou givest us, Sigurd, and with exceeding strength thou
strengthenest our realm."

Then Gunnar said, "All things that may be will we do for thee, so thou
abidest here long; both dominion shalt thou have, and our sister freely
and unprayed for, whom another man would not get for all his prayers."

Sigurd says, "Thanks have ye for this wherewith ye honour me, and
gladly will I take the same."

Therewith they swore brotherhood together, and to be even as if they
were children of one father and one mother; and a noble feast was
holden, and endured many days, and Sigurd drank at the wedding of him
and Gudrun; and there might men behold all manner of game and glee, and
each day the feast better and better.

Now fare these folk wide over the world, and do many great deeds, and
slay many kings' sons, and no man has ever done such works of prowess as
did they; then home they come again with much wealth won in war.

Sigurd gave of the serpent's heart to Gudrun, and she ate thereof, and
became greater-hearted, and wiser than ere before: and the son of these
twain was called Sigmund.

Now on a time went Grimhild to Gunnar her son, and spake--

"Fair blooms the life and fortune of thee, but for one thing only, and
namely whereas thou art unwedded; go woo Brynhild; good rede is this,
and Sigurd will ride with thee."

Gunnar answered, "Fair is she certes, and I am fain enow to win her;"
and therewith he tells his father, and his brethren, and Sigurd, and
they all prick him on to that wooing.



CHAPTER XXVII. The Wooing of Brynhild.

Now they array them joyously for their journey, and ride over hill and
dale to the house of King Budli, and woo his daughter of him; in a good
wise he took their speech, if so be that she herself would not deny
them; but he said withal that so high-minded was she, that that man
only might wed her whom she would.

Then they ride to Hlymdale, and there Heimir gave them good welcome; so
Gunnar tells his errand; Heimir says, that she must needs wed but him
whom she herself chose freely; and tells them how her abode was but a
little way thence, and that he deemed that him only would she have who
should ride through the flaming fire that was drawn round about her
hall; so they depart and come to the hall and the fire, and see there a
castle with a golden roof-ridge, and all round about a fire roaring up.

Now Gunnar rode on Goti, but Hogni on Holkvi, and Gunnar smote his horse
to face the fire, but he shrank aback.

Then said Sigurd, "Why givest thou back, Gunnar?"

He answered, "The horse will not tread this fire; but lend me thy horse
Grani."

"Yea, with all my good will," says Sigurd.

Then Gunnar rides him at the fire, and yet nowise will Gram stir, nor
may Gunnar any the more ride through that fire. So now they change
semblance, Gunnar and Sigurd, even as Grimhild had taught them; then
Sigurd in the likeness of Gunnar mounts and rides, Gram in his hand, and
golden spurs on his heels; then leapt Grani into the fire when he felt
the spurs; and a mighty roar arose as the fire burned ever madder, and
the earth trembled, and the flames went up even unto the heavens, nor
had any dared to ride as he rode, even as it were through the deep mirk.

But now the fire sank withal, and he leapt from his horse and went into
the hall, even as the song says--

     "The flame flared at its maddest,
     Earth's fields fell a-quaking
     As the red flame aloft
     Licked the lowest of heaven.
     Few had been fain,
     Of the rulers of folk,
     To ride through that flame,
     Or athwart it to tread.

     "Then Sigurd smote
     Grani with sword,
     And the flame was slaked
     Before the king;
     Low lay the flames
     Before the fain of fame;
     Bright gleamed the array
     That Regin erst owned.

Now when Sigurd had passed through the fire, he came into a certain fair
dwelling, and therein sat Brynhild.

She asked, "What man is it?"

Then he named himself Gunnar, son of Giuki, and said--"Thou art awarded
to me as my wife, by the good will and word of thy father and thy
foster-father, and I have ridden through the flames of thy fire,
according to thy word that thou hast set forth."

"I wot not clearly," said she, "how I shall answer thee."

Now Sigurd stood upright on the hall floor, and leaned on the hilt of
his sword, and he spake to Brynhild--

"In reward thereof, shall I pay thee a great dower in gold and goodly
things?"

She answered in heavy mood from her seat, whereas she sat like unto swan
on billow, having a sword in her hand, and a helm on her head, and being
clad in a byrny, "O Gunnar," she says, "speak not to me of such things,
unless thou be the first and best of all men; for then shalt thou slay
those my wooers, if thou hast heart thereto; I have been in battles with
the king of the Greeks, and our weapons were stained with red blood, and for
such things still I yearn."

He answered, "Yea, certes many great deeds hast thou done; but yet call
thou to mind thine oath, concerning the riding through of this fire,
wherein thou didst swear that thou wouldst go with the man who should do
this deed."

So she found that he spoke but the sooth, and she paid heed to his
words, and arose, and greeted him meetly, and he abode there three
nights, and they lay in one bed together; but he took the sword Gram and
laid it betwixt them: then she asked him why he laid it there; and he
answered, that in that wise must he needs wed his wife or else get his
bane.

Then she took from off her the ring Andvari's-loom, which he had given
her aforetime, and gave it to him, but he gave her another ring out of
Fafnir's hoard.

Thereafter he rode away through the same fire unto his fellows, and he
and Gunnar changed semblances again, and rode unto Hlymdale, and told
how it had gone with them.

That same day went Brynhild home to her foster-father, and tells him
as one whom she trusted, how that there had come a king to her; "And he
rode through my flaming fire, and said he was come to woo me, and named
himself Gunnar; but I said that such a deed might Sigurd alone have
done, with whom I plighted troth on the mountain; and he is my first
troth-plight, and my well-beloved."

Heimir said that things must needs abide even as now they had now come
to pass.

Brynhild said, "Aslaug the daughter of me and Sigurd shall be nourished
here with thee."

Now the kings fare home, but Brynhild goes to her father; Grimhild
welcomes the kings meetly, and thanks Sigurd for his fellowship; and
withal is a great feast made, and many were the guests thereat; and
thither came Budli the King with his daughter Brynhild, and his son
Atli, and for many days did the feast endure: and at that feast was
Gunnar wedded to Brynhild: but when it was brought to an end, once more
has Sigurd memory of all the oaths that he sware unto Brynhild, yet
withal he let all things abide in rest and peace.

Brynhild and Gunnar sat together in great game and glee, and drank
goodly wine.



CHAPTER XXVIII. How the Queens held angry converse together at the
Bathing.

On a day as the Queens went to the river to bathe them, Brynhild waded
the farthest out into the river; then asked Gudrun what that deed might
signify.

Brynhild said, "Yea, and why then should I be equal to thee in this
matter more than in others? I am minded to think that my father is
mightier than thine, and my true love has wrought many wondrous works of
fame, and hath ridden the flaming fire withal, while thy husband was but
the thrall of King Hjalprek."

Gudrun answered full of wrath, "Thou wouldst be wise if thou shouldst
hold thy peace rather than revile my husband: lo now, the talk of all
men it is, that none has ever abode in this world like unto him in all
matters soever; and little it beseems thee of all folk to mock him who
was thy first beloved: and Fafnir he slew, yea, and he rode thy flaming
fire, whereas thou didst deem that he was Gunnar the King, and by thy
side he lay, and took from thine hand the ring Andvari's-loom;--here
mayst thou well behold it!"

Then Brynhild saw the ring and knew it, and waxed as wan as a dead
woman, and she went home and spake no word the evening long.

So when Sigurd came to bed to Gudrun she asked him why Brynhild's joy
was so departed.

He answered, "I know not, but sore I misdoubt me that soon we shall know
thereof overwell."

Gudrun said, "Why may she not love her life, having wealth and bliss,
and the praise of all men, and the man withal that she would have?"

"Ah, yea!" said Sigurd, "and where in all the world was she then, when
she said that she deemed she had the noblest of all men, and the dearest
to her heart of all?"

Gudrun answers, "Tomorn will I ask her concerning this, who is the
liefest to her of all men for a husband."

Sigurd said, "Needs must I forbid thee this, and full surely wilt thou
rue the deed if thou doest it."

Now the next morning they sat in the bower, and Brynhild was silent;
then spake Gudrun--

"Be merry, Brynhild! Grievest thou because of that speech of ours
together, or what other thing slayeth thy bliss?"

Brynhild answers, "With naught but evil intent thou sayest this, for a
cruel heart thou hast."

"Say not so," said Gudrun; "but rather tell me all the tale."

Brynhild answers, "Ask such things only as are good for thee to
know--matters meet for mighty dames. Good to love good things when all
goes according to thy heart's desire!"

Gudrun says, "Early days for me to glory in that; but this word of thine
looketh toward some foreseeing. What ill dost thou thrust at us? I did
naught to grieve thee."

Brynhild answers, "For this shalt thou pay, in that thou hast got Sigurd
to thee,--nowise can I see thee living in the bliss thereof, whereas
thou hast him, and the wealth and the might of him."

But Gudrun answered, "Naught knew I of your words and vows together; and
well might my father look to the mating of me without dealing with thee
first."

"No secret speech had we," quoth Brynhild, "though we swore oath
together; and full well didst thou know that thou wentest about to
beguile me; verily thou shalt have thy reward!"

Says Gudrun, "Thou art mated better than thou are worthy of; but thy
pride and rage shall be hard to slake belike, and therefor shall many a
man pay."

"Ah, I should be well content," said Brynhild, "if thou hadst not the
nobler man!"

Gudrun answers, "So noble a husband hast thou, that who knows of a
greater king or a lord of more wealth and might?"

Says Brynhild, "Sigurd slew Fafnir, and that only deed is of more worth
than all the might of King Gunnar."

(Even as the song says):

     "The worm Sigurd slew,
     Nor e'er shall that deed
     Be worsened by age
     While the world is alive:
     But thy brother the King
     Never durst, never bore
     The flame to ride down
     Through the fire to fare."

Gudrun answers, "Grani would not abide the fire under Gunnar the King,
but Sigurd durst the deed, and thy heart may well abide without mocking
him."

Brynhild answers, "Nowise will I hide from thee that I deem no good of
Grimhild."

Says Gudrun, "Nay, lay no ill words on her, for in all things she is to
thee as to her own daughter."

"Ah," says Brynhild, "she is the beginning of all this hale that biteth
so; an evil drink she bare to Sigurd, so that he had no more memory of
my very name."

"All wrong thou talkest; a lie without measure is this," quoth Gudrun.

Brynhild answered, "Have thou joy of Sigurd according to the measure of
the wiles wherewith ye have beguiled me! Unworthily have ye conspired
against me; may all things go with you as my heart hopes!"

Gudrun says, "More joy shall I have of him than thy wish would give unto
me: but to no man's mind it came, that he had aforetime his pleasure of
me; nay not once."

"Evil speech thou speakest," says Brynhild; "when thy wrath runs off
thou wilt rue it; but come now, let us no more cast angry words one at
the other!"

Says Gudrun, "Thou wert the first to cast such words at me, and now thou
makest as if thou wouldst amend it, but a cruel and hard heart abides
behind."

"Let us lay aside vain babble," says Brynhild. "Long did I hold my peace
concerning my sorrow of heart, and, lo now, thy brother alone do I love;
let us fall to other talk."

Gudrun said, "Far beyond all this doth thine heart look."

And so ugly ill befell from that going to the river, and that knowing of
the ring, wherefrom did all their talk arise.



CHAPTER XXIX. Of Brynhild's great Grief and Mourning.

After this talk Brynhild lay a-bed, and tidings were brought to King
Gunnar that Brynhild was sick; he goes to see her thereon, and asks what
ails her; but she answered him naught, but lay there as one dead: and
when he was hard on her for an answer, she said--

"What didst thou with that ring that I gave thee, even the one which
King Budli gave me at our last parting, when thou and King Giuki came to
him and threatened fire and the sword, unless ye had me to wife? Yea, at
that time he led me apart, and asked me which I had chosen of those who
were come; but I prayed him that I might abide to ward the land and be
chief over the third part of his men; then were there two choices for me
to deal betwixt, either that I should be wedded to him whom he would, or
lose all my weal and friendship at his hands; and he said withal that
his friendship would be better to me than his wrath: then I bethought me
whether I should yield to his will, or slay many a man; and therewithal
I deemed that it would avail little to strive with him, and so it fell
out, that I promised to wed whomsoever should ride the horse Grani with
Fafnir's Hoard, and ride through my flaming fire, and slay those men
whom I called on him to slay, and now so it was, that none durst ride,
save Sigurd only, because he lacked no heart thereto; yea, and the Worm
he slew, and Regin, and five kings beside; but thou, Gunnar, durst do
naught; as pale as a dead man didst thou wax, and no king thou art,
and no champion; so whereas I made a vow unto my father, that him alone
would I love who was the noblest man alive, and that this is none save
Sigurd, lo, now have I broken my oath and brought it to naught, since
he is none of mine, and for this cause shall I compass thy death; and a
great reward of evil things have I wherewith to reward Grimhild;--never,
I wot, has woman lived eviler or of lesser heart than she."

Gunnar answered in such wise that few might hear him, "Many a vile
word hast thou spoken, and an evil-hearted woman art thou, whereas thou
revilest a woman far better than thou; never would she curse her life
as thou dost; nay, nor has she tormented dead folk, or murdered any; but
lives her life well praised of all."

Brynhild answered, "Never have I dwelt with evil things privily, or done
loathsome deeds;--yet most fain I am to slay thee."

And therewith would she slay King Gunnar, but Hogni laid her in fetters;
but then Gunnar spake withal--

"Nay, I will not that she abide in fetters."

Then said she, "Heed it not! For never again seest thou me glad in thine
hall, never drinking, never at the chess-play, never speaking the words
of kindness, never over-laying the fair cloths with gold, never giving
thee good counsel;--ah, my sorrow of heart that I might not get Sigurd
to me!"

Then she sat up and smote her needlework, and rent it asunder, and bade
set open her bower doors, that far away might the wailings of her sorrow
be heard; then great mourning and lamentation there was, so that folk
heard it far and wide through that abode.

Now Gudrun asked her bower-maidens why they sat so joyless and downcast.
"What has come to you, that ye fare ye as witless women, or what
unheard-of wonders have befallen you?"

Then answered a waiting lady, hight Swaflod, "An untimely, an evil day
it is, and our hall is fulfilled of lamentation."

Then spake Gudrun to one of her handmaids, "Arise, for we have slept
long; go, wake Brynhild, and let us fall to our needlework and be
merry."

"Nay, nay," she says, "nowise may I wake her, or talk with her; for many
days has she drunk neither mead nor wine; surely the wrath of the Gods
has fallen upon her."

Then spake Gudrun to Gunnar, "Go and see her," she says, "and bid her
know that I am grieved with her grief."

"Nay," says Gunnar, "I am forbid to go see her or to share her weal."

Nevertheless he went unto her, and strives in many wise to have speech
of her, but gets no answer whatsoever; therefore he gets him gone and
finds Hogni, and bids him go see her: he said he was loth thereto, but
went, and gat no more of her.

Then they go and find Sigurd, and pray him to visit her; he answered
naught thereto, and so matters abode for that night.

But the next day, when he came home from hunting, Sigurd went to Gudrun,
and spake--

"In such wise do matters show to me, as though great and evil things
will betide from this trouble and upheaving; and that Brynhild will
surely die."

Gudrun answers, "O my lord, by great wonders is she encompassed, seven
days and seven nights has she slept, and none has dared wake her."

"Nay, she sleeps not," said Sigurd, "her heart is dealing rather with
dreadful intent against me."

Then said Gudrun, weeping, "Woe worth the while for thy death! Go and
see her; and wot if her fury may not be abated; give her gold, and
smother up her grief and anger therewith!"

Then Sigurd went out, and found the door of Brynhild's chamber open; he
deemed she slept, and drew the clothes from off her, and said--

"Awake, Brynhild! The sun shineth now over all the house, and thou hast
slept enough; cast off grief from thee, and take up gladness!"

She said, "And how then hast thou dared to come to me? in this treason
none was worse to me than thou."

Said Sigurd, "Why wilt thou not speak to folk? for what cause sorrowest
thou?"

Brynhild answers, "Ah, to thee will I tell of my wrath!"

Sigurd said, "As one under a spell art thou, if thou deemest that there
is aught cruel in my heart against thee; but thou hast him for husband
whom thou didst choose."

"Ah, nay," she said, "never did Gunnar ride through the fire to me, nor
did he give me to dower the host of the slain: I wondered at the man
who came into my hall; for I deemed indeed that I knew thine eyes; but I
might not see clearly, or divide the good from the evil, because of the
veil that lay heavy on my fortune."

Says Sigurd, "No nobler men are there than the sons of Giuki, they slew
the king of the Danes, and that great chief, the brother of King Budli."

Brynhild answered, "Surely for many an ill-deed must I reward them; mind
me not of my griefs against them! But thou, Sigurd, slewest the Worm,
and rodest the fire through; yea, and for my sake, and not one of the
sons of King Giuki."

Sigurd answers, "I am not thy husband, and thou art not my wife; yet did
a farfamed king pay dower to thee."

Says Brynhild, "Never looked I at Gunnar in such a wise that my heart
smiled on him; and hard and fell am I to him, though I hide it from
others."

"A marvellous thing," says Sigurd, "not to love such a king; what angers
thee most? for surely his love should be better to thee than gold."

"This is the sorest sorrow to me," she said, "that the bitter sword is
not reddened in thy blood."

"Have no fear thereof!" says he, "no long while to wait or the bitter
sword stand deep in my heart; and no worse needest thou to pray for
thyself, for thou wilt not live when I am dead; the days of our two
lives shall be few enough from henceforth."

Brynhild answers, "Enough and to spare of bale is in thy speech, since
thou bewrayedst me, and didst twin (1) me and all bliss;--naught do I
heed my life or death."

Sigurd answers, "Ah, live, and love King Gunnar and me withal! and all
my wealth will I give thee if thou die not."

Brynhild answers, "Thou knowest me not, nor the heart that is in me;
for thou art the first and best of all men, and I am become the most
loathsome of all women to thee."

"This is truer," says Sigurd, "that I loved thee better than myself,
though I fell into the wiles from whence our lives may not escape; for
whenso my own heart and mind availed me, then I sorrowed sore that thou
wert not my wife; but as I might I put my trouble from me, for in a
king's dwelling was I; and withal and in spite of all I was well content
that we were all together. Well may it be, that that shall come to pass
which is foretold; neither shall I fear the fulfilment thereof."

Brynhild answered, and said, "Too late thou tellest me that my grief
grieved thee: little pity shall I find now."

Sigurd said, "This my heart would, that thou and I should go into one
bed together; even so wouldst thou be my wife."

Said Brynhild, "Such words may nowise be spoken, nor will I have two
kings in one hall; I will lay my life down rather than beguile Gunnar
the King."

And therewith she call to mind how they met, they two, on the mountain,
and swore oath each to each.

"But now is all changed, and I will not live."

"I might not call to mind thy name," said Sigurd, "or know thee again,
before the time of thy wedding; the greatest of all griefs is that."

Then said Brynhild, "I swore an oath to wed the man who should ride my
flaming fire, and that oath will I hold to, or die."

"Rather than thou die, I will wed thee, and put away Gudrun," said
Sigurd.

But therewithal so swelled the heart betwixt the sides of him, that the
rings of his byrny burst asunder.

"I will not have thee," says Brynhild, "nay, nor any other!"

Then Sigurd got him gone.

So saith the song of Sigurd--

     "Out then went Sigurd,
     The great kings' well-loved,
     From the speech and the sorrow,
     Sore drooping, so grieving,
     That the shirt round about him
     Of iron rings woven,
     From the sides brake asunder
     Of the brave in the battle."

So when Sigurd came into the hall, Gunnar asked if he had come to a
knowledge of what great grief lay heavy on her, or if she had power of
speech: and Sigurd said that she lacked it not. So now Gunnar goes
to her again, and asked her, what wrought her woe, or if there were
anything that might amend it.

"I will not live," says Brynhild, "for Sigurd has bewrayed me, yea,
and thee no less, whereas thou didst suffer him to come into my bed:
lo thou, two men in one dwelling I will not have; and this shall be
Sigurd's death, or thy death, or my death;--for now has he told Gudrun
all, and she is mocking me even now!"

CHAPTER XXX. Of the Slaying of Sigurd Fafnir's-bane.

Thereafter Brynhild went out, and sat under her bower-wall, and had
many words of wailing to say, and still she cried that all things were
loathsome to her, both land and lordship alike, so she might not have
Sigurd.

But therewith came Gunnar to her yet again, and Brynhild spake, "Thou
shalt lose both realm and wealth, and thy life and me, for I shall fare
home to my kin, and abide there in sorrow, unless thou slayest Sigurd
and his son; never nourish thou a wolfcub."

Gunnar grew sick at heart thereat, and might nowise see what fearful
thing lay beneath it all; he was bound to Sigurd by oath, and this way
and that way swung the heart within him; but at the last he bethought
him of the measureless shame if his wife went from him, and he said
within himself, "Brynhild is better to me than all things else, and the
fairest woman of all women, and I will lay down my life rather than lose
the love of her." And herewith he called to him his brother and spake,--

"Trouble is heavy on me," and he tells him that he must needs slay
Sigurd, for that he has failed him where in he trusted him; "so let us
be lords of the gold and the realm withal."

Hogni answers, "Ill it behoves us to break our oaths with wrack and
wrong, and withal great aid we have in him; no kings shall be as
great as we, if so be the King of the Hun-folk may live; such another
brother-in-law never may we get again; bethink thee how good it is to
have such a brother-in-law, and such sons to our sister! But well I see
how things stand, for this has Brynhild stirred thee up to, and surely
shall her counsel drag us into huge shame and scathe."

Gunnar says, "Yet shall it be brought about: and, lo, a rede
thereto;--let us egg on our brother Guttorm to the deed; he is young,
and of little knowledge, and is clean out of all the oaths moreover."

"Ah, set about in ill wise," says Hogni, "and though indeed it may well
be compassed, a due reward shall we gain for the bewrayal of such a man
as is Sigurd."

Gunnar says, "Sigurd shall die, or I shall die."

And therewith he bids Brynhild arise and be glad at heart: so she arose,
and still ever she said that Gunnar should come no more into her bed
till the deed was done.

So the brothers fall to talk, and Gunnar says that it is a deed well
worthy of death, that taking of Brynhild's maidenhead; "So come now, let
us prick on Guttorm to do the deed."

Therewith they call him to them, and offer him gold and great dominion,
as they well have might to do. Yea, and they took a certain worm and
somewhat of wolf's flesh and let seethe them together, and gave him to
eat of the same, even as the singer sings--

     "Fish of the wild-wood,
     Worm smooth crawling,
     With wolf-meat mingled,
     They minced for Guttorm;
     Then in the beaker,
     In the wine his mouth knew,
     They set it, still doing
     More deeds of wizards.

Wherefore with the eating of this meat he grew so wild and eager, and
with all things about him, and with the heavy words of Grimhild, that
he gave his word to do the deed; and mighty honour they promised him in
reward thereof.

But of these evil wiles naught at all knew Sigurd, for he might not deal
with his shapen fate, nor the measure of his life-days, neither deemed
he that he was worthy of such things at their hands.

So Guttorm went in to Sigurd the next morning as he lay upon his bed,
yet durst he not do aught against him, but shrank back out again; yea,
and even so he fared a second time, for so bright and eager were the
eyes of Sigurd that few durst look upon him. But the third time he went
in, and there lay Sigurd asleep; then Guttorm drew his sword and thrust
Sigurd through in such wise that the sword point smote into the bed
beneath him; then Sigurd awoke with that wound, and Guttorm gat him unto
the door; but therewith Sigurd caught up the sword Gram, and cast it
after him, and it smote him on the back, and struck him asunder in the
midst, so that the feet of him fell one way, and the head and hands back
into the chamber.

Now Gudrun lay asleep on Sigurd's bosom, but she woke up unto woe that
may not be told of, all swimming in the blood of him, and in such wise
did she bewail her with weeping and words of sorrow, that Sigurd rose up
on the bolster, and spake.

"Weep not," said he, "for thy brothers live for thy delight; but a young
son have I, too young to be ware of his foes; and an ill turn have these
played against their own fortune; for never will they get a mightier
brother-in-law to ride abroad with them; nay, nor a better son to their
sister, than this one, if he may grow to man's estate. Lo, now is that
come to pass which was foretold me long ago, but from mine eyes has it
been hidden, for none may fight against his fate and prevail. Behold
this has Brynhild brought to pass, even she who loves me before all
men; but this may I swear, that never have I wrought ill to Gunnar, but
rather have ever held fast to my oath with him, nor was I ever too much
a friend to his wife. And now if I had been forewarned, and had been
afoot with my weapons, then should many a man have lost his life or
ever I had fallen, and all those brethren should have been slain, and
a harder work would the slaying of me have been than the slaying of the
mightiest bull or the mightiest boar of the wild-wood."

And even therewithal life left the King; but Gudrun moaned and drew
a weary breath, and Brynhild heard it, and laughed when she heard her
moaning.

Then said Gunnar, "Thou laughest not because thy heart-roots are
gladdened, or else why doth thy visage wax so wan? Sure an evil creature
thou art; most like thou art nigh to thy death! Lo now, how meet would
it be for thee to behold thy brother Atli slain before thine eyes, and
that thou shouldst stand over him dead; whereas we must needs now
stand over our brother-in-law in such a case, our brother-in-law and our
brother's bane."

She answered, "None need mock at the measure of slaughter being
unfulfilled; yet heedeth not Atli your wrath or your threats; yea, he
shall live longer than ye, and be a mightier man."

Hogni spake and said, "Now hath come to pass the soothsaying of
Brynhild; an ill work not to be atoned for."

And Gudrun said, "My kinsmen have slain my husband; but ye, when ye next
ride to the war and are come into the battle, then shall ye look about
and see that Sigurd is neither on the right hand nor the left, and ye
shall know that he was your good-hap and your strength; and if he
had lived and had sons, then should ye have been strengthened by his
offspring and his kin."



CHAPTER XXXI. Of the Lamentation of Gudrun over Sigurd dead, as it is
told told in ancient Songs. (1)

     Gudrun of old days
     Drew near to dying
     As she sat in sorrow
     Over Sigurd;
     Yet she sighed not
     Nor smote hand on hand,
     Nor wailed she aught
     As other women.

     Then went earls to her.
     Full of all wisdom,
     Fain help to deal
     To her dreadful heart:
     Hushed was Gudrun
     Of wail, or greeting,
     But with a heavy woe
     Was her heart a-breaking.

     Bright and fair
     Sat the great earls' brides,
     Gold arrayed
     Before Gudrun;
     Each told the tale
     Of her great trouble,
     The bitterest bale
     She erst abode.

     Then spake Giaflaug,
     Giuki's sister:
     "Lo upon earth
     I live most loveless
     Who of five mates
     Must see the ending,
     Of daughters twain
     And three sisters,
     Of brethren eight,
     And abide behind lonely."

     Naught gat Gudrun
     Of wail and greeting,
     So heavy was she
     For her dead husband,
     So dreadful-hearted
     For the King laid dead there.

     Then spake Herborg
     Queen of Hunland--
     "Crueller tale
     Have I to tell of,
     Of my seven sons
     Down in the Southlands,
     And the eighth man, my mate,
     Felled in the death-mead.

     "Father and mother,
     And four brothers,
     On the wide sea
     The winds and death played with;
     The billows beat
     On the bulwark boards.

     "Alone must I sing o'er them,
     Alone must I array them,
     Alone must my hands deal with
     Their departing;
     And all this was
     In one season's wearing,
     And none was left
     For love or solace.

     "Then was I bound
     A prey of the battle,
     When that same season
     Wore to its ending;
     As a tiring may
     Must I bind the shoon
     Of the duke's high dame,
     Every day at dawning.

     "From her jealous hate
     Gat I heavy mocking,
     Cruel lashes
     She laid upon me,
     Never met I
     Better master
     Or mistress worser
     In all the wide world."

     Naught gat Gudrun
     Of wail or greeting,
     So heavy was she
     For her dead husband,
     So dreadful-hearted
     For the King laid dead there.

     Then spake Gullrond,
     Giuki's daughter--
     "O foster-mother,
     Wise as thou mayst be,
     Naught canst thou better
     The young wife's bale."
     And she bade uncover
     The dead King's corpse.

     She swept the sheet
     Away from Sigurd,
     And turned his cheek
     Towards his wife's knees--
     "Look on thy loved one
     Lay lips to his lips,
     E'en as thou wert clinging
     To thy king alive yet!"

     Once looked Gudrun--
     One look only,
     And saw her lord's locks
     Lying all bloody,
     The great man's eyes
     Glazed and deadly,
     And his heart's bulwark
     Broken by sword-edge.

     Back then sank Gudrun,
     Back on the bolster,
     Loosed was her head array,
     Red did her cheeks grow,
     And the rain-drops ran
     Down over her knees.

     Then wept Gudrun,
     Giuki's daughter,
     So that the tears flowed
     Through the pillow;
     As the geese withal
     That were in the homefield,
     The fair fowls the may owned,
     Fell a-screaming.

     Then spake Gullrond,
     Giuki's daughter--
     "Surely knew I
     No love like your love
     Among all men,
     On the mould abiding;
     Naught wouldst thou joy in
     Without or within doors,
     O my sister,
     Save beside Sigurd."

     Then spake Gudrun,
     Giuki's daughter--
     "Such was my Sigurd
     Among the sons of Giuki,
     As is the king leek
     O'er the low grass waxing,
     Or a bright stone
     Strung on band,
     Or a pearl of price
     On a prince's brow.

     "Once was I counted
     By the king's warriors
     Higher than any
     Of Herjan's mays;
     Now am I as little
     As the leaf may be,
     Amid wind-swept wood
     Now when dead he lieth.

     I miss from my seat,
     I miss from my bed,
     My darling of sweet speech.
     Wrought the sons of Giuki,
     Wrought the sons of Giuki,
     This sore sorrow,
     Yea, for their sister,
     Most sore sorrow.

     "So may your lands
     Lie waste on all sides,
     As ye have broken
     Your bounden oaths!
     Ne'er shalt thou, Gunnar,
     The gold have joy of;
     The dear-bought rings
     Shall drag thee to death,
     Whereon thou swarest
     Oath unto Sigurd.

     Ah, in the days by-gone
     Great mirth in the homefield
     When my Sigurd
     Set saddle on Grani,
     And they went their ways
     For the wooing of Brynhild!
     An ill day, an ill woman,
     And most ill hap!"

     Then spake Brynhild,
     Budli's daughter--
     "May the woman lack
     Both love and children,
     Who gained greeting
     For thee, O Gudrun!
     Who gave thee this morning
     Many words!"

     Then spake Gullrond,
     Giuki's daughter--
     "Hold peace of such words
     Thou hated of all folk!
     The bane of brave men
     Hast thou been ever,
     All waves of ill
     Wash over thy mind,
     To seven great kings
     Hast thou been a sore sorrow,
     And the death of good will
     To wives and women."

     Then spake Brynhild,
     Budli's daughter--
     "None but Atli
     Brought bale upon us,
     My very brother
     Born of Budli.

     When we saw in the hall
     Of the Hunnish people
     The gold a-gleaming
     On the kingly Giukings;
     I have paid for that faring
     Oft and full,
     And for the sight
     That then I saw."

     By a pillar she stood
     And strained its wood to her;
     From the eyes of Brynhild,
     Budli's daughter,
     Flashed out fire,
     And she snorted forth venom,
     As the sore wounds she gazed on
     Of the dead-slain Sigurd.

CHAPTER XXXII. Of the Ending of Brynhild.

And now none might know for what cause Brynhild must bewail with weeping
for what she had prayed for with laughter: but she spake--

"Such a dream I had, Gunnar, as that my bed was acold, and that thou
didst ride into the hands of thy foes: lo now, ill shall it go with thee
and all thy kin, O ye breakers of oaths; for on the day thou slayedst
him, dimly didst thou remember how thou didst blend thy blood with the
blood of Sigurd, and with an ill reward hast thou rewarded him for all
that he did well to thee; whereas he gave unto thee to be the mightiest
of men; and well was it proven how fast he held to his oath sworn, when
he came to me and laid betwixt us the sharp-edged sword that in venom
had been made hard. All too soon did ye fall to working wrong against
him and against me, whenas I abode at home with my father, and had all
that I would, and had no will that any one of you should be any of mine,
as ye rode into our garth, ye three kings together; but then Atli led me
apart privily, and asked me if I would not have him who rode Grani; yea,
a man nowise like unto you; but in those days I plighted myself to the
son of King Sigmund and no other; and lo, now, no better shall ye fare
for the death of me."

Then rose up Gunnar, and laid his arms about her neck, and besought her
to live and have wealth from him; and all others in likewise letted her
from dying; but she thrust them all from her, and said that it was not
the part of any to let her in that which was her will.

Then Gunnar called to Hogni, and prayed him for counsel, and bade him go
to her, and see if he might perchance soften her dreadful heart, saying
withal, that now they had need enough on their hands in the slaking of
her grief, till time might get over.

But Hogni answered, "Nay, let no man hinder her from dying; for no gain
will she be to us, nor has she been gainsome since she came hither!

Now she bade bring forth much gold, and bade all those come thither who
would have wealth: then she caught up a sword, and thrust it under her
armpit, and sank aside upon the pillows, and said, "Come, take gold
whoso will!"

But all held their peace, and she said, "Take the gold, and be glad
thereof!"

And therewith she spake unto Gunnar, "Now for a little while will I tell
of that which shall come to pass hereafter; for speedily shall ye be
at one again with Gudrun by the rede of Grimhild the Wise-wife; and the
daughter of Gudrun and Sigurd shall be called Swanhild, the fairest of
all women born. Gudrun shall be given to Atli, yet not with her good
will. Thou shalt be fain to get Oddrun, but that shall Atli forbid thee;
but privily shall ye meet, and much shall she love thee. Atli shall
bewray thee, and cast thee into a worm-close, and thereafter shall Atli
and his sons be slain, and Gudrun shall be their slayer; and afterwards
shall the great waves bear her to the burg of King Jonakr, to whom she
shall bear sons of great fame: Swanhild shall be sent from the land
and given to King Jormunrek; and her shall bite the rede of Bikki, and
therewithal is the kin of you clean gone; and more sorrows therewith for
Gudrun.

"And now I pray thee, Gunnar, one last boon.--Let make a great bale on
the plain meads for all of us; for me, and for Sigurd, and for those who
were slain with him, and let that be covered over with cloth dyed red by
the folk of the Gauls, (1) and burn me thereon on one side of the King
of the Huns, and on the other those men of mine, two at the head and two
at the feet, and two hawks withal; and even so is all shared equally;
and lay there betwixt us a drawn sword, as in the other days when we
twain stepped into one bed together; and then may we have the name of
man and wife, nor shall the door swing to at the heel of him as I go
behind him. Nor shall that be a niggard company if there follow him
those five bond-women and eight bondmen, whom my father gave me, and
those burn there withal who were slain with Sigurd.

"Now more yet would I say, but for my wounds, but my life-breath flits;
the wounds open,--yet have I said sooth."

Now is the dead corpse of Sigurd arrayed in olden wise, and a mighty
bale is raised, and when it was somewhat kindled, there was laid thereon
the dead corpse of Sigurd Fafnir's-bane, and his son of three winters
whom Brynhild had let slay, and Guttorm withal; and when the bale was
all ablaze, thereunto was Brynhild borne out, when she had spoken with
her bower-maidens, and bid them take the gold that she would give; and
then died Brynhild, and was burned there by the side of Sigurd, and thus
their life-days ended.

CHAPTER XXXIII. Gudrun wedded to Atli.

Now so it is, that whoso heareth these tidings sayeth, that no such an
one as was Sigurd was left behind him in the world, nor ever was such a
man brought forth because of all the worth of him, nor may his name ever
minish by eld in the Dutch Tongue nor in all the Northern Lands, while
the world standeth fast.

The story tells that, on a day, as Gudrun sat in her bower, she fell to
saying, "Better was life in those days when I had Sigurd; he who was far
above other men as gold is above iron, or the leek over other grass
of the field, or the hart over other wild things; until my brethren
begrudged me such a man, the first and best of all men; and so they
might not sleep or they had slain him. Huge clamour made Grani when he
saw his master and lord sore wounded, and then I spoke to him even as
with a man, but he fell drooping down to the earth, for he knew that
Sigurd was slain."

Thereafter Gudrun gat her gone into the wild woods, and heard on all
ways round about her the howling of wolves, and deemed death a merrier
thing than life. Then she went till she came to the hall of King Alf,
and sat there in Denmark with Thora, the daughter of Hakon, for seven
seasons, and abode with good welcome. And she set forth her needlework
before her, and did thereinto many deeds and great, and fair plays after
the fashion of those days, swords and byrnies, and all the gear of
kings, and the ship of King Sigmund sailing along the land; yea, and
they wrought there, how they fought, Sigar and Siggeir, south in Fion.
Such was their disport; and now Gudrun was somewhat solaced of her
grief.

So Grimhild comes to hear where Gudrun has take up her abode, and
she calls her sons to talk with her, and asks whether they will make
atonement to Gudrun for her son and her husband, and said that it was
but meet and right to do so.

Then Gunnar spake, and said that he would atone for her sorrows with
gold.

So they send for their friends, and array their horses, their helms,
and their shields, and their byrnies, and all their war-gear; and their
journey was furnished forth in the noblest wise, and no champion who
was of the great men might abide at home; and their horses were clad in
mail-coats, and every knight of them had his helm done over with gold or
with silver.

Grimhild was of their company, for she said that their errand would
never be brought fairly to pass if she sat at home.

There were well five hundred men, and noble men rode with them. There
was Waldemar of Denmark, and Eymod and Jarisleif withal. So they went
into the hall of King Alf, and there abode them the Longbeards and
Franks, and Saxons: they fared with all their war-gear, and had over
them red fur-coats. Even as the song says--

     "Byrnies short cut,
     Strong helms hammered,
     Girt with good swords,
     Red hair gleaming."

They were fain to choose good gifts for their sister, and spake softly
to her, but in none of them would she trow. Then Gunnar brought unto her
a drink mingled with hurtful things, and this she must needs drink, and
with the drinking thereof she had no more memory of their guilt against
her.

But in that drink was blended the might of the earth and the sea with
the blood of her son; and in that horn were all letters cut and reddened
with blood, as is said hereunder--

     "On the horn's face were there
     All the kin of letters
     Cut aright and reddened,
     How should I rede them rightly?
     The ling-fish long
     Of the land of Hadding,
     Wheat-ears unshorn,
     And wild things' inwards.

     In that beer were mingled
     Many ills together,
     Blood of all the wood
     And brown-burnt acorns,
     The black dew of the hearth,
     The God-doomed dead beast's inwards,
     And the swine's liver sodden
     Because all wrongs that deadens.

And so now, when their hearts are brought anigh to each other, great
cheer they made: then came Grimhild to Gudrun, and spake:

"All hail to thee, daughter! I give thee gold and all kinds of good
things to take to thee after thy father, dear-bought rings and bed-gear
of the maids of the Huns, the most courteous and well dight of all
women; and thus is thy husband atoned for: and thereafter shalt thou be
given to Atli, the mighty king, and be mistress of all his might. Cast
not all thy friends aside for one man's sake, but do according to our
bidding."

Gudrun answers, "Never will I wed Atli the King: unseemly it is for us
to get offspring betwixt us."

Grimhild says, "Nourish not thy wrath; it shall be to thee as if Sigurd
and Sigmund were alive when thou hast borne sons."

Gudrun says, "I cannot take my heart from thoughts of him, for he was
the first of all men."

Grimhild says, "So it is shapen that thou must have this king and none
else."

Says Gudrun, "Give not this man to me, for an evil thing shall come
upon thy kin from him, and to his own sons shall he deal evil, and be
rewarded with a grim revenge thereafter."

Then waxed Grimhild fell at those words, and spake, "Do even as we
bid thee, and take therefore great honour, and our friendship, and the
steads withal called Vinbjorg and Valbjorg."

And such might was in the words of her, that even so must it come to
pass.

Then Gudrun spake, "Thus then must it needs befall, howsoever against
the will of me, and for little joy shall it be and for great grief."

Then men leaped on their horses, and their women were set in wains. So
they fared four days a-riding and other four a-shipboard, and yet four
more again by land and road, till at the last they came to a certain
high-built hall; then came to meet Gudrun many folk thronging; and
an exceedingly goodly feast was there made, even as the word had gone
between either kin, and it passed forth in most proud and stately wise.
And at that feast drinks Atli his bridal with Gudrun; but never did her
heart laugh on him, and little sweet and kind was their life together.



CHAPTER XXXIV. Atli bids the Giukings to him.

Now tells the tale that on a night King Atli woke from sleep and spake
to Gudrun--

"Medreamed," said he, "that thou didst thrust me through with a sword."

Then Gudrun areded the dream, and said that it betokened fire, whenas
folk dreamed of iron. "It befalls of thy pride belike, in that thou
deemest thyself the first of men."

Atli said, "Moreover I dreamed that here waxed two sorb-tree (1)
saplings, and fain I was that they should have no scathe of me; then
these were riven up by the roots and reddened with blood, and borne to
the bench, and I was bidden eat thereof.

"Yea, yet again I dreamed that two hawks flew from my hand hungry and
unfed, and fared to hell, and meseemed their hearts were mingled with
honey, and that I ate thereof.

"And then again I dreamed that two fair whelps lay before me yelling
aloud, and that the flesh of them I ate, though my will went not with
the eating."

Gudrun says, "Nowise good are these dreams, yet shall they come to pass;
surely thy sons are nigh to death, and many heavy things shall fall upon
us."

"Yet again I dreamed," said he, "and methought I lay in a bath, and folk
took counsel to slay me."

Now these things wear away with time, but in nowise was their life
together fond.

Now falls Atli to thinking of where may be gotten that plenteous gold
which Sigurd had owned, but King Gunnar and his brethren were lords
thereof now.

Atli was a great king and mighty, wise, and a lord of many men; and now
he falls to counsel with his folk as to the ways of them. He wotted well
that Gunnar and his brethren had more wealth than any others might have,
and so he falls to the rede of sending men to them, and bidding them
to a great feast, and honouring them in diverse wise, and the chief of
those messengers was hight Vingi.

Now the queen wots of their conspiring, and misdoubts her that this
would mean some beguiling of her brethren: so she cut runes, and took a
gold ring, and knit therein a wolf's hair, and gave it into the hands of
the king's messengers.

Thereafter they go their ways according to the king's bidding; and or
ever they came aland Vingi beheld the runes, and turned them about in
such wise as if Gudrun prayed her brethren in her runes to go meet King
Atli.

Thereafter they came to the hall of King Gunnar, and had good welcome at
his hands, and great fires were made for them, and in great joyance they
drank of the best of drink.

Then spake Vingi, "King Atli sends me hither, and is fain that ye go
to his house and home in all glory, and take of him exceeding honours,
helms and shields, swords and byrnies, gold and goodly raiment, horses,
hosts of war, and great and wide lands, for, saith he, he is fainest of
all things to bestow his realm and lordship upon you."

Then Gunnar turned his head aside, and spoke to Hogni--

"In what wise shall we take this bidding? might and wealth he bids us
take; but no kings know I who have so much gold as we have, whereas
we have all the hoard which lay once on Gnitaheath; and great are our
chambers, and full of gold, and weapons for smiting, and all kinds of
raiment of war, and well I wot that amidst all men my horse is the best,
and my sword the sharpest, and my gold the most glorious."

Hogni answers, "A marvel is it to me of his bidding, for seldom hath he
done in such a wise, and ill-counselled will it be to wend to him; lo
now, when I saw those dear-bought things the king sends us I wondered to
behold a wolf's hair knit to a certain gold ring; belike Gudrun deems him
to be minded as a wolf towards us, and will have naught of our faring."

But withal Vingi shows him the runes which he said Gudrun had sent.

Now the most of folk go to bed, but these drank on still with certain
others; and Kostbera, the wife of Hogni, the fairest of women, came to
them, and looked on the runes.

But the wife of Gunnar was Glaumvor, a great-hearted wife.

So these twain poured out, and the kings drank, and were exceeding
drunken, and Vingi notes it, and says--

"Naught may I hide that King Atli is heavy of foot and over-old for the
warding of his realm; but his sons are young and of no account: now will
he give you rule over his realms while they are yet thus young, and most
fain will he be that ye have the joy thereof before all others."

Now so it befell both that Gunnar was drunk, and that great dominion was
held out to him, nor might he work against the fate shapen for him; so
he gave his word to go, and tells Hogni his brother thereof.

But he answered, "Thy word given must even stand now, nor will I fail to
follow thee, but most loth am I to this journey."

CHAPTER XXXV. The Dreams of the Wives of the Giukings.

So when men had drunk their fill, they fared to sleep; then falls
Kostbera to beholding the runes, and spelling over the letters, and sees
that beneath were other things cut, and that the runes are guileful;
yet because of her wisdom she had skill to read them aright. So then she
goes to bed by her husband; but when they awoke, she spake unto Hogni--

"Thou art minded to wend away from home--ill-counselled is that; abide
till another time! Scarce a keen reader of runes art thou, if thou
deemest thou hast beheld in them the bidding of thy sister to this
journey: lo, I read the runes, and had marvel of so wise a woman
as Gudrun is, that she should have miscut them; but that which lieth
underneath beareth your bane with it,--yea, either she lacked a letter,
or others have dealt guilefully with the runes.

"And now hearken to my dream; for therein methought there fell in upon
us here a river exceeding strong, and brake up the timbers of the hall."

He answered, "Full oft are ye evil of mind, ye women, but for me, I
was not made in such wise as to meet men with evil who deserve no evil;
belike he will give us good welcome."

She answered, "Well, the thing must ye yourselves prove, but no
friendship follows this bidding:--but yet again I dreamed that another
river fell in here with a great and grimly rush, and tore up the dais
of the hall, and brake the legs of both you brethren; surely that
betokeneth somewhat."

He answers, "Meadows along our way, whereas thou didst dream of the
river; for when we go through the meadows, plentifully doth the seeds of
the hay hang about our legs."

"Again I dreamed," she says, "that thy cloak was afire, and that the
flame blazed up above the hall."

Says he, "Well, I wot what that shall betoken; here lieth my fair-dyed
raiment, and it shall burn and blaze, whereas thou dreamedst of the
cloak."

"Methought a bear came in," she says, "and brake up the king's
high-seat, and shook his paws in such a wise that we were all adrad
thereat, and he gat us all together into the mouth of him, so that we
might avail us naught, and thereof fell great horror on us."

He answered, "Some great storm will befall, whereas thou hadst a white
bear in thy mind."

"An erne methought came in," she says, "and swept adown the hall, and
drenched me and all of us with blood, and ill shall that betoken, for
methought it was the double of King Atli."

He answered, "Full oft do we slaughter beasts freely, and smite down
great neat for our cheer, and the dream of the erne has but to do with
oxen; yea, Atli is heart-whole toward us."

And therewithal they cease this talk.



CHAPTER XXXVI. Of the Journey of the Giukings to King Atli.

Now tells the tale of Gunnar, that in the same wise it fared with him;
for when they awoke, Glaumvor his wife told him many dreams which seemed
to her like to betoken guile coming; but Gunnar areded them all in other
wise.

"This was one of them," said she; "methought a bloody sword was borne
into the hall here, wherewith thou wert thrust through, and at either
end of that sword wolves howled."

The king answered, "Cur dogs shall bite me belike; blood-stained weapons
oft betoken dogs' snappings."

She said, "Yet again I dreamed--that women came in, heavy and drooping,
and chose thee for their mate; may-happen these would be thy fateful
women."

He answered, "Hard to arede is this, and none may set aside the fated
measure of his days, nor is it unlike that my time is short." (1)

So in the morning they arose, and were minded for the journey, but some
letted them herein.

Then cried Gunnar to the man who is called Fjornir--

"Arise, and give us to drink goodly wine from great tuns, because
mayhappen this shall be very last of all our feasts; for belike if we
die the old wolf shall come by the gold, and that bear shall nowise
spare the bite of his war-tusks."

Then all the folk of his household brought them on their way weeping.

The son of Hogni said--

"Fare ye well with merry tide."

The more part of their folk were left behind; Solar and Snaevar, the
sons of Hogni, fared with them, and a certain great champion, named
Orkning, who was the brother of Kostbera.

So folk followed them down to the ships, and all letted them of their
journey, but attained to naught therein.

Then spake Glaumvor, and said--

"O Vingi, most like that great ill hap will come of thy coming, and
mighty and evil things shall betide in thy travelling."

He answered, "Hearken to my answer; that I lie not aught: and may the
high gallows and all things of grame have me, if I lie one word!"

Then cried Kostbera, "Fare ye well with merry days."

And Hogni answered, "Be glad of heart, howsoever it may fare with us!"

And therewith they parted, each to their own fate. Then away they rowed,
so hard and fast, that well-nigh the half of the keel slipped away from
the ship, and so hard they laid on to the oars that thole and gunwale
brake.

But when they came aland they made their ship fast, and then they rode
awhile on their noble steeds through the murk wild-wood.

And now they behold the king's army, and huge uproar, and the clatter of
weapons they hear from thence; and they see there a mighty host of men,
and the manifold array of them, even as they wrought there: and all the
gates of the burg were full of men.

So they rode up to the burg, and the gates thereof were shut; then Hogni
brake open the gates, and therewith they ride into the burg.

Then spake Vingi, "Well might ye have left this deed undone; go to now,
bide ye here while I go seek your gallows-tree! Softly and sweetly I
bade you hither, but an evil thing abode thereunder; short while to bide
ere ye are tied up to that same tree!"

Hogni answered, "None the more shall we waver for that cause; for little
methinks have we shrunk aback whenas men fell to fight; and naught
shall it avail thee to make us afeard,--and for an ill fate hast thou
wrought."

And therewith they cast him down to earth, and smote him with their
axe-hammers till he died.

CHAPTER XXXVII. The Battle in the Burg of King Atli.

Then they rode unto the king's hall, and King Atli arrayed his host for
battle, and the ranks were so set forth that a certain wall there was
betwixt them and the brethren.

"Welcome hither," said he. "Deliver unto me that plenteous gold which is
mine of right; even the wealth which Sigurd once owned, and which is now
Gudrun's of right."

Gunnar answered, "Never gettest thou that wealth; and men of might must
thou meet here, or ever we lay by life if thou wilt deal with us in
battle; ah, belike thou settest forth this feast like a great man, and
wouldst not hold thine hand from erne and wolf!"

"Long ago I had it in my mind," said Atli, "to take the lives of you, and
be lord of the gold, and reward you for that deed of shame, wherein ye
beguiled the best of all your affinity; but now shall I revenge him."

Hogni answered, "Little will it avail to lie long brooding over that
rede, leaving the work undone."

And therewith they fell to hard fighting, at the first brunt with shot.

But therewithal came the tidings to Gudrun, and when she heard thereof
she grew exceeding wroth, and cast her mantle from her, and ran out and
greeted those new-comers, and kissed her brethren, and showed them all
love,--and the last of all greetings was that betwixt them.

Then said she, "I thought I had set forth counsels whereby ye should not
come hither, but none may deal with his shapen fate." And withal she
said, "Will it avail aught to seek for peace?"

But stoutly and grimly they said nay thereto. So she sees that the
game goeth sorely against her brethren, and she gathers to her great
stoutness of heart, and does on her a mail-coat and takes to her a
sword, and fights by her brethren, and goes as far forward as the
bravest of man-folk: and all spoke in one wise that never saw any fairer
defence than in her.

Now the men fell thick, and far before all others was the fighting of
those brethren, and the battle endured a long while unto midday; Gunnar
and Hogni went right through the folk of Atli, and so tells the tale
that all the mead ran red with blood; the sons of Hogni withal set on
stoutly.

Then spake Atli the king, "A fair host and a great have we, and mighty
champions withal, and yet have many of us fallen, and but evil am I
apaid in that nineteen of my champions are slain, and but left six
alive."

And therewithal was there a lull in the battle.

Then spake Atli the king, "Four brethren were we, and now am I left
alone; great affinity I gat to me, and deemed my fortune well sped
thereby; a wife I had, fair and wise, high of mind, and great of heart;
but no joyance may I have of her wisdom, for little peace is betwixt
us,--but ye--ye have slain many of my kin, and beguiled me of realm and
riches, and for the greatest of all woes have slain my sister withal."

Quoth Hogni, "Why babblest thou thus? thou wert the first to break the
peace. Thou didst take my kinswoman and pine her to death by hunger, and
didst murder her, and take her wealth; an ugly deed for a king!--meet
for mocking and laughter I deem it, that thou must needs make long tale
of thy woes; rather will I give thanks to the Gods that thou fallest
into ill."



CHAPTER XXXVIII. Of the slaying of the Giukings.

Now King Atli eggs on his folk to set on fiercely, and eagerly they
fight; but the Giukings fell on so hard that King Atli gave back into
the hall, and within doors was the fight, and fierce beyond all fights.

That battle was the death of many a man, but such was the ending
thereof, that there fell all the folk of those brethren, and they twain
alone stood up on their feet, and yet many more must fare to hell first
before their weapons.

And now they fell on Gunnar the king, and because of the host of men
that set on him was hand laid on him, and he was cast into fetters;
afterwards fought Hogni, with the stoutest heart and the greatest
manlihood; and he felled to earth twenty of the stoutest of the
champions of King Atli, and many he thrust into the fire that burnt
amidst the hall, and all were of one accord that such a man might scarce
be seen; yet in the end was he borne down by many and taken.

Then said King Atli, "A marvellous thing how many men have gone their
ways before him! Cut the heart from out of him, and let that be his
bane!"

Hogni said, "Do according to thy will; merrily will I abide whatso thou
wrlt do against me; and thou shalt see that my heart is not adrad, for
hard matters have I made trial of ere now, and all things that may try
a man was I fain to bear, whiles yet I was unhurt; but now sorely am
I hurt, and thou alone henceforth will bear mastery in our dealings
together."

Then spake a counsellor of King Atli, "Better rede I see thereto; take
we the thrall Hjalli, and give respite to Hogni; for this thrall is made
to die, since the longer he lives the less worth shall he be."

The thrall hearkened, and cried out aloft, and fled away anywhither
where he might hope for shelter, crying out that a hard portion was his
because of their strife and wild doings, and an ill day for him whereon
he must be dragged to death from his sweet life and his swine-keeping.
But they caught him, and turned a knife against him, and he yelled and
screamed or ever he felt the point thereof.

Then in such wise spake Hogni as a man seldom speaketh who is fallen
into hard need, for he prayed for the thrall's life, and said that these
shrieks he could not away with, and that it were a lesser matter to him
to play out the play to the end; and therewithal the thrall gat his life
as for that time: but Gunnar and Hogni are both laid in fetters.

Then spake King Atli with Gunnar the king, and bade him tell out
concerning the gold, and where it was, if he would have his life.

But he answered, "Nay, first will I behold the bloody heart of Hogni, my
brother."

So now they caught hold of the thrall again, and cut the heart from out
of him, and bore it unto King Gunnar, but he said--

"The faint heart of Hjalli may ye here behold, little like the proud
heart of Hogni, for as much as it trembleth now, more by the half it
trembled whenas it lay in the breast of him."

So now they fell on Hogni even as Atli urged them, and cut the heart
from out of him, but such was the might of his manhood, that he laughed
while he abode that torment, and all wondered at his worth, and in
perpetual memory is it held sithence. (1)

Then they showed it to Gunnar, and he said--

"The mighty heart of Hogni, little like the faint heart of Hjalli, for
little as it trembleth now, less it trembled whenas in his breast it
lay! But now, O Atli, even as we die so shalt thou die; and lo, I alone
wot where the gold is, nor shall Hogni be to tell thereof now; to and
fro played the matter in my mind whiles we both lived, but now have I
myself determined for myself, and the Rhine river shall rule over the
gold, rather than that the Huns shall bear it on the hands of them."

Then said King Atli, "Have away the bondsman;" and so they did.

But Gudrun called to her men, and came to Atli, and said--

"May it fare ill with thee now and from henceforth, even as thou hast
ill held to thy word with me!"

So Gunnar was cast into a worm-close, and many worms abode him there,
and his hands were fast bound; but Gudrun sent him a harp, and in such
wise did he set forth his craft, that wisely he smote the harp, smiting
it with his toes, and so excellently well he played, that few deemed
they had heard such playing, even when the hand had done it. And with
such might and power he played, that all worms fell asleep in the end,
save one adder only, great and evil of aspect, that crept unto him and
thrust its sting into him until it smote his heart; and in such wise
with great hardihood he ended his life days.

CHAPTER XXXIX. The End of Atli and his Kin and Folk.

Now thought Atli the King that he had gained a mighty victory, and spake
to Gudrun even as mocking her greatly, or as making himself great before
her. "Gudrun," saith he, "thus hast thou lost thy brethren, and thy very
self hast brought it about."

She answers, "In good liking livest thou, whereas thou thrustest these
slayings before me, but mayhappen thou wilt rue it, when thou hast tried
what is to come hereafter; and of all I have, the longest-lived matter
shall be the memory of thy cruel heart, nor shall it go well with thee
whiles I live."

He answered and said, "Let there be peace betwixt us; I will atone for
thy brethren with gold and dear-bought things, even as thy heart may
wish."

She answers, "Hard for a long while have I been in our dealings
together, and now I say, that while Hogni was yet alive thou mightest
have brought it to pass; but now mayest thou never atone for my brethren
in my heart; yet oft must we women be overborne by the might of you men;
and now are all my kindred dead and gone, and thou alone art left to
rule over me: wherefore now this is my counsel that we make a great
feast, wherein I will hold the funeral of my brother and of thy kindred
withal."

In such wise did she make herself soft and kind in words, though far
other things forsooth lay thereunder, but he hearkened to her gladly,
and trusted in her words, whereas she made herself sweet of speech.

So Gudrun held the funeral feast for her brethren, and King Atli for his
men, and exceeding proud and great was this feast.

But Gudrun forgat not her woe, but brooded over it, how she might work
some mighty shame against the king; and at nightfall she took to her the
sons of King Atli and her as they played about the floor; the younglings
waxed heavy of cheer, and asked what she would with them.

"Ask me not," she said; "ye shall die, the twain of you!"

Then they answered, "Thou mayest do with thy children even as thou wilt,
nor shall any hinder thee, but shame there is to thee in the doing of
this deed."

Yet for all that she cut the throats of them.

Then the king asked where his sons were, and Gudrun answered, "I will
tell thee, and gladden thine heart by the telling; lo now, thou didst
make a great woe spring up for me in the slaying of my brethren; now
hearken and hear my rede and my deed; thou hast lost thy sons, and
their heads are become beakers on the board here, and thou thyself hast
drunken the blood of them blended with wine; and their hearts I took and
roasted them on a spit, and thou hast eaten thereof."

King Atli answered, "Grim art thou in that thou hast murdered thy sons,
and given me their flesh to eat, and little space passes betwixt ill
deed of thine and ill deed."

Gudrun said, "My heart is set on the doing to thee of as great shame as
may be; never shall the measure of ill be full to such a king as thou
art."

The king said, "Worser deeds hast thou done than men have to tell of,
and great unwisdom is there in such fearful redes; most meet art thou
to be burned on bale when thou hast first been smitten to death with
stones, for in such wise wouldst thou have what thou hast gone a weary
way to seek."

She answered, "Thine own death thou foretellest, but another death is
fated for me."

And many other words they spake in their wrath.

Now Hogni had a son left alive, hight Niblung, and great wrath of heart
he bare against King Atli; and he did Gudrun to wit that he would
avenge his father. And she took his words well, and they fell to counsel
together thereover, and she said it would be great goodhap if it might
be brought about.

So on a night, when the king had drunken, he gat him to bed, and when he
was laid asleep, thither to him came Gudrun and the son of Hogni.

Gudrun took a sword and thrust it through the breast of King Atli, and
they both of them set their hands to the deed, both she and the son of
Hogni.

Then Atli the king awoke with the wound, and cried out; "no need of
binding or salving here!--who art thou who hast done the deed?"

Gudrun says, "Somewhat have I, Gudrun, wrought therein, and somewhat
withal the son of Hogni."

Atli said, "Ill it beseemed to thee to do this, though somewhat of wrong
was between us; for thou wert wedded to me by the rede of thy kin, and
dower paid I for thee; yea, thirty goodly knights, and seemly maidens,
and many men besides; and yet wert thou not content, but if thou should
rule over the lands King Budli owned: and thy mother-in-law full oft
thou lettest sit a-weeping."

Gudrun said, "Many false words hast thou spoken, and of naught I account
them; oft, indeed, was I fell of mood, but much didst thou add thereto.
Full oft in this thy house did frays befall, and kin fought kin, and
friend fought friend, and made themselves big one against the other;
better days had I whenas I abode with Sigurd, when we slew kings, and
took their wealth to us, but gave peace to whomso would, and the great
men laid themselves under our hands, and might we gave to him of them
who would have it; then I lost him, and a little thing was it that I
should bear a widow's name, but the greatest of griefs that I should
come to thee--I who had aforetime the noblest of all kings, while for
thee, thou never barest out of the battle aught but the worser lot."

King Atli answered, "Naught true are thy words, nor will this our speech
better the lot of either of us, for all is fallen now to naught; but now
do to me in seemly wise, and array my dead corpse in noble fashion."

"Yea, that will I," she says, "and let make for thee a goodly grave, and
build for thee a worthy abiding place of stone, and wrap thee in fair
linen, and care for all that needful is."

So therewithal he died, and she did according to her word: and then they
cast fire into the hall.

And when the folk and men of estate awoke amid that dread and trouble,
naught would they abide the fire, but smote each the other down, and
died in such wise; so there Atli the king, and all his folk, ended their
life-days. But Gudrun had no will to live longer after this deed so
wrought, but nevertheless her ending day was not yet come upon her.

Now the Volsungs and the Giukings, as folk tell in tale, have been the
greatest-hearted and the mightiest of all men, as ye may well behold
written in the songs of old time.

But now with the tidings just told were these troubles stayed.



CHAPTER XL. How Gudrun cast herself into the Sea, but was brought ashore
again.

Gudrun had a daughter by Sigurd hight Swanhild; she was the fairest of
all women, eager-eyed as her father, so that few durst look under the
brows of her; and as far did she excel other woman-kind as the sun
excels the other lights of heaven.

But on a day went Gudrun down to the sea, and caught up stones in her
arms, and went out into the sea, for she had will to end her life. But
mighty billows drave her forth along the sea, and by means of their
upholding was she borne along till she came at the last to the burg of
King Jonakr, a mighty king, and lord of many folk. And he took Gudrun to
wife, and their children were Hamdir, and Sorli, and Erp; and there was
Swanhild nourished withal.



CHAPTER XLI. Of the Wedding and Slaying of Swanhild.

Jormunrek was the name of a mighty king of those days, and his son was
called Randver. Now this king called his son to talk with him, and said,
"Thou shalt fare on an errand of mine to King Jonakr, with my counsellor
Bikki, for with King Jonakr is nourished Swanhild, the daughter of
Sigurd Fafnir's-bane; and I know for sure that she is the fairest may
dwelling under the sun of this world; her above all others would I have
to my wife, and thou shalt go woo her for me."

Randver answered, "Meet and right, fair lord, that I should go on thine
errands."

So the king set forth this journey in seemly wise, and they fare till
they come to King Jonakr's abode, and behold Swanhild, and have many
thoughts concerning the treasure of her goodliness.

But on a day Randver called the king to talk with him, and said,
"Jormunrek the King would fain be thy brother-in-law, for he has heard
tell of Swanhild, and his desire it is to have her to wife, nor may it
be shown that she may be given to any mightier man than he is one."

The King says, "This is an alliance of great honour, for a man of fame
he is."

Gudrun says, "A wavering trust, the trust in luck that it change not!"

Yet because of the king's furthering, and all the matters that went
herewith, is the wooing accomplished; and Swanhild went to the ship with
a goodly company, and sat in the stern beside the king's son.

Then spake Bikki to Randver, "How good and right it were if thou thyself
had to wife so lovely a woman rather than the old man there."

Good seemed that word to the heart of the king's son, and he spake to
her with sweet words, and she to him in like wise.

So they came aland and go unto the king, and Bikki said unto him, "Meet
and right it is, lord, that thou shouldst know what is befallen, though
hard it be to tell of, for the tale must be concerning thy beguiling,
whereas thy son has gotten to him the full love of Swanhild, nor is she
other than his harlot; but thou, let not the deed be unavenged."

Now many an ill rede had he given the king or this, but of all his ill
redes did this sting home the most; and still would the king hearken
to all his evil redes; wherefore he, who might nowise still the wrath
within him, cried out that Randver should be taken and tied up to the
gallows-tree.

And as he was led to the gallows he took his hawk and plucked the
feathers from off it, and bade show it to his father; and when the king
saw it, then he said, "Now may folk behold that he deemeth my honour to
be gone away from me, even as the feathers of this hawk;" and therewith
he bade deliver him from the gallows.

But in that while had Bikki wrought his will, and Randver was
dead-slain.

And, moreover, Bikki spake, "Against none hast thou more wrongs to
avenge thee of than against Swanhild; let her die a shameful death."

"Yea," said the king, "we will do after thy counsel."

So she was bound in the gate of the burg, and horses were driven at her
to tread her down; but when she opened her eyes wide, then the horses
durst not trample her; so when Bikki beheld that, he bade draw a bag
over the head of her; and they did so, and therewith she lost her life.
(1)


  ENDNOTES
  (1)  In the prose Edda the slaying of Swanhild is a spontaneous
       and sudden act on the part of the king.  As he came back
       from hunting one day, there sat Swanhild washing her linen,
       and it came into the king's mind how that she was the cause
       of all his woe, so he and his men rode over her and slew
       her.--Tr.



CHAPTER XLII. Gudrun sends her Sons to avenge Swanhild.

Now Gudrun heard of the slaying of Swanhild, and spake to her sons, "Why
sit ye here in peace amid merry words, whereas Jormunrek hath slain your
sister, and trodden her under foot of horses in shameful wise? No heart
ye have in you like to Gunnar or Hogni; verily they would have avenged
their kinswoman!"

Hamdir answered, "Little didst thou praise Gunnar and Hogni, whereas
they slew Sigurd, and thou wert reddened in the blood of him, and ill
were thy brethren avenged by the slaying of thine own sons: yet not
so ill a deed were it for us to slay King Jormunrek, and so hard thou
pushest us on to this that we may naught abide thy hard words."

Gudrun went about laughing now, and gave them to drink from mighty
beakers, and thereafter she got for them great byrnies and good, and all
other weed (1) of war.

Then spake Hamdir, "Lo now, this is our last parting, for thou shalt
hear tidings of us, and drink one grave-ale (2) over us and over
Swanhild."

So therewith they went their ways.

But Gudrun went unto her bower, with heart swollen with sorrow, and
spake--

"To three men was I wedded, and first to Sigurd Fafnir's-bane, and he
was bewrayed and slain, and of all griefs was that the greatest grief.
Then was I given to King Atli, and so fell was my heart toward him that
I slew in the fury of my grief his children and mine. Then gave I myself
to the sea, but the billows thereof cast me out aland, and to this king
then was I given; then gave I Swanhild away out of the land with mighty
wealth; and lo, my next greatest sorrow after Sigurd, for under horses'
feet was she trodden and slain; but the grimmest and ugliest of woes
was the casting of Gunnar into the Worm-close, and the hardest was the
cutting of Hogni's heart from him.

"Ah, better would it be if Sigurd came to meet me, and I went my ways
with him, for here bideth now behind with me neither son nor daughter
to comfort me. Oh, mindest thou not, Sigurd, the words we spoke when we
went into one bed together, that thou wouldst come and look on me; yea,
even from thine abiding place among the dead?"

And thus had the words of her sorrow an end.

CHAPTER XLIII. The Latter End of all the Kin of the Giukings.

Now telleth the tale concerning the sons of Gudrun, that she had arrayed
their war-raiment in such wise, that no steel would bite thereon; and
she bade them play not with stones or other heavy matters, for that it
would be to their scathe if they did so.

And now, as they went on their way, they met Erp, their brother, and
asked him in what wise he would help them.

He answered, "Even as hand helps hand, or foot helps foot."

But that they deemed naught at all, and slew him there and then. Then
they went their ways, nor was it long or ever Hamdir stumbled, and
thrust down his hand to steady himself, and spake therewith--

"Naught but a true thing spake Erp, for now should I have fallen, had
not hand been to steady me."

A little after Sorli stumbled, but turned about on his feet, and
so stood, and spake--

"Yea now had I fallen, but that I steadied myself with both feet."

And they said they had done evilly with Erp their brother.

But on they fare till they come to the abode of King Jormunrek, and they
went up to him and set on him forthwith, and Hamdir cut both hands from
him and Sorli both feet. Then spake Hamdir--

"Off were the head if Erp were alive; our brother, whom we slew on the
way, and found out our deed too late." Even as the Song says,--

     "Off were the head
     If Erp were alive yet,
     Our brother the bold,
     Whom we slew by the way,
     The well-famed in warfare."

Now in this must they turn away from the words of their mother, whereas
they had to deal with stones. For now men fell on them, and they
defended themselves in good and manly wise, and were the scathe of many
a man, nor would iron bite on them.

But there came thereto a certain man, old of aspect and one-eyed, (1)
and he spake--

"No wise men are ye, whereas ye cannot bring these men to their end."

Then the king said, "Give us rede thereto, if thou canst."

He said, "Smite them to the death with stones."

In such wise was it done, for the stones flew thick and fast from every
side, and that was the end of their life-days.

And now has come to an end the whole root and stem of the Giukings. (2)

     NOW MAY ALL EARLS
     BE BETTERED IN MIND,
     MAY THE GRIEF OF ALL MAIDENS
     EVER BE MINISHED,
     FOR THIS TALE OF TROUBLE
     SO TOLD TO ITS ENDING.

APPENDIX: EXCERPTS FROM THE POETIC EDDA.




PART OF THE SECOND LAY OF HELGI HUNDINGS-BANE (1)

Helgi wedded Sigrun, and they begate sons together, but Helgi lived not
to be old; for Dag, (2) the son of Hogni, sacrificed to Odin, praying
that he might avenge his father. So Odin lent Dag his spear, and Dag met
Helgi, his brother-in-law, at a place called Fetter-grove, and thrust
him through with that spear, and there fell Helgi dead; but Dag rode to
Sevafell, and told Sigrun of the news.

     DAG:
     Loth am I, sister
     Of sorrow to tell thee,
     For by hard need driven
     Have I drawn on the greeting;
     This morning fell
     In Fetter-grove
     The king well deemed
     The best in the wide world,
     Yea, he who stood
     On the necks of the strong."

     SIGRUN:
     All oaths once sworn
     Shall bite thee sore,
     The oaths that to Helgi
     Once thou swarest
     At the bright white
     Water of Lightening, (3)
     And at the cold rock
     That the sea runneth over.

     May the ship sweep not on
     That should sweep at its swiftest,
     Though the wind desired
     Behind thee driveth!
     May the horse never run
     That should run at his most might
     When from thy foe's face
     Thou hast most need to flee!

     May the sword never bite
     That thou drawest from scabbard
     But and if round thine head
     In wrath it singeth!

     Then should meet price be paid
     For Helgi's slaying
     When a wolf thou wert
     Out in the wild-wood,
     Empty of good things
     Empty of gladness,
     With no meat for thy mouth
     But dead men's corpses!

     DAG:
     With mad words thou ravest,
     Thy wits are gone from thee,
     When thou for thy brother
     Such ill fate biddest;
     Odin alone
     Let all this bale loose,
     Casting the strife-runes
     'Twixt friends and kindred.

     Rings of red gold
     Will thy brother give thee,
     And the stead of Vandil
     And the lands of Vigdale;
     Have half of the land
     For thy sorrow's healing,
     O ring-arrayed sweetling
     For thee and thy sons!

     SIGRUN:
     No more sit I happy
     At Sevafell;
     At day-dawn, at night
     Naught love I my life
     Till broad o'er the people
     My lord's light breaketh;
     Till his war-horse runneth
     Beneath him hither,
     Well wont to the gold bit--
     Till my king I welcome.

     In such wise did Helgi
     Deal fear around
     To all his foes
     And all their friends
     As when the goat runneth
     Before the wolf's rage
     Filled with mad fear
     Down from the fell.

     As high above all lords
     Did Helgi beat him
     As the ash-tree's glory
     From the thorn ariseth,
     Or as the fawn
     With the dew-fell sprinkled
     Is far above
     All other wild things,
     As his horns go gleaming
     'Gainst the very heavens.

A barrow was raised above Helgi, but when he came in Valhall, then Odin
bade him be lord of all things there, even as he; so Helgi sang--

     HELGI:
     Now shalt thou, Hunding
     For the help of each man
     Get ready the foot-bath,
     And kindle the fire;
     The hounds shalt thou bind
     And give heed to the horses,
     Give wash to the swine
     Ere to sleep thou goest.

A bondmaid of Sigrun went in the evening-tide by Helgi's mound, and
there saw how Helgi rode toward it with a great company; then she sang--

     BONDMAID:
     It is vain things' beguilling
     That methinks I behold,
     Or the ending of all things,
     As ye ride, O ye dead men,
     Smiting with spurs
     Your horses' sides?
     Or may dead warriors
     Wend their ways homeward?

     THE DEAD:
     No vain things' beguiling
     Is that thou beholdest,
     Nor the ruin of all things;
     Though thou lookest upon us,
     Though we smite with spurs
     Our horses' sides;
     Rather dead warriors
     May wend their ways homeward.

Then went the bondmaid home, and told Sigrun, and sang--

     BONDMAID:
     Go out, Sigrun
     From Sevafell,
     If thou listest to look on
     The lord of thy people!
     For the mound is uncovered
     Thither is Helgi come,
     And his wounds are bleeding,
     But the king thee biddeth
     To come and stay
     That stream of sorrow.

So Sigrun went into the mound to Helgi, and sang--

     SIGRUN:
     Now am I as fain
     Of this fair meeting,
     As are the hungry
     Hawks of Odin,
     When they wot of the slaying
     Of the yet warm quarry,
     Or bright with dew
     See the day a-dawning.

     Ah, I will kiss
     My king laid lifeless,
     Ere thou castest by
     Thy blood-stained byrny.
     O Helgi, thy hair
     Is thick with death's rime,
     With the dew of the dead
     Is my love all dripping;
     Dead-cold are the hands
     Of the son of Hogni;
     How for thee, O my king,
     May I win healing?

     HELGI:
     Thou alone, Sigrun
     Of Sevafell,
     Hast so done that Helgi
     With grief's dew drippeth;
     O clad in gold
     Cruel tears thou weepest,
     Bright May of the Southlands,
     Or ever thou sleepest;
     Each tear in blood falleth
     On the breast of thy lord,
     Cold wet and bitter-sharp
     Swollen with sorrow.

     Ah, we shall drink
     Dear draughts and lovely,
     Though, we have lost
     Both life and lands;
     Neither shall any
     Sing song of sorrow,
     Though in my breast
     Be wounds wide to behold:
     For now are brides
     In the mound abiding;
     Kings' daughters sit
     By us departed.

Bow Sigrun arrayed a bed in the mound, and sang--

     SIGRUN:
     Here, Helgi, for thee
     A bed have I dight,
     Kind without woe,
     O kin of the Ylfings!
     To thy bosom, O king,
     Will I come and sleep soft,
     As I was wont
     When my lord was living.

     HELGI:
     Now will I call
     Naught not to be hoped for
     Early or late
     At Sevafell,
     When thou in the arms
     Of a dead man art laid,
     White maiden of Hogni,
     Here in the mound:
     And thou yet quick,
     O King's daughter!

     Now needs must I ride
     On the reddening ways;
     My pale horse must tread
     The highway aloft;
     West must I go
     To Windhelm's bridge
     Ere the war-winning crowd
     Hall-crower (4) waketh.

So Helgi rode his ways: and the others gat them gone home to the house.
But the next night Sigrun bade the bondwoman have heed of the mound. So
at nightfall, thenas Sigrun came to the mound, she sang:

     SIGRUN:
     Here now would he come,
     If to come he were minded;
     Sigmund's offspring
     From the halls of Odin.
     O me the hope waneth
     Of Helgi's coming;
     For high on the ash-boughs
     Are the ernes abiding,
     And all folk drift
     Toward the Thing of the dreamland.

     BONDMAID:
     Be not foolish of heart,
     And fare all alone
     To the house of the dead,
     O Hero's daughter!
     For more strong and dreadful
     In the night season
     Are all dead warriors
     Than in the daylight.

But a little while lived Sigrun, because of her sorrow and trouble.
But in old time folk trowed that men should be born again, though their
troth be now deemed but an old wife's dotting. And so, as folk say,
Helgi and Sigrun were born again, and at that tide was he called Helgi
the Scathe of Hadding, and she Kara the daughter of Halfdan; and she was
a Valkyrie, even as is said in the Lay of Kara.

PART OF THE LAY OF SIGRDRIFA (1)

       Now this is my first counsel,
       That thou with thy kin
     Be guiltless, guileless ever,
       Nor hasty of wrath,
       Despite of wrong done--
     Unto the dead good that doeth.

       Lo the second counsel,
       That oath thou swearest never,
     But trusty oath and true:
       Grim tormenting
       Gripes troth-breakers;
     Cursed wretch is the wolf of vows.

       This is my third rede,
       That thou at the Thing
     Deal not with the fools of folk;
       For unwise man
       From mouth lets fall
     Worser word than well he wotteth.

       Yet hard it is
       That holding of peace
     When men shall deem thee dastard,
     Or deem the lie said soothly;
     But woeful is home-witness,
     Unless right good thou gettest it.
       Ah, on another day
       Drive the life from out him,
     And pay the liar back for his lying.

       Now behold the fourth rede:
       If ill witch thee bideth,
     Woe-begatting by the way,
       Good going further
       Rather than guesting,
     Though thick night be on thee.

       Far-seeing eyes
       Need all sons of men
     Who wend in wrath to war;
       For baleful women
       Bide oft by the highway,
     Swords and hearts to soften.

       And now the fifth rede:
       As fair as thou seest
     Brides on the bench abiding,
       Let not love's silver
       Rule over thy sleeping;
     Draw no woman to kind kissing!

       For the sixth thing, I rede
       When men sit a-drinking
     Amid ale-words and ill-words,
       Dead thou naught
       With the drunken fight-staves
     For wine stealeth wit from many.

       Brawling and drink
       Have brought unto men
     Sorrow sore oft enow;
       Yea, bane unto some,
       And to some weary bale;
     Many are the griefs of mankind.

       For the seventh, I rede thee,
       If strife thou raisest
     With a man right high of heart,
       Better fight a-field
       Than burn in the fire
     Within thine hall fair to behold.

       The eighth rede that I give thee:
       Unto all ill look thou,
     And hold thine heart from all beguiling;
       Draw to thee no maiden,
       No man's wife bewray thou,
     Urge them not unto unmeet pleasure.

       This is the ninth counsel:
       That thou have heed of dead folk
     Whereso thou findest them a-field;
       Be they sick-dead,
       Be they sea-dead,
     Or come to ending by war-weapons.

       Let bath be made
       For such men fordone,
     Wash thou hands and feet thereof,
       Comb their hair and dry them
       Ere the coffin has them;
     Then bid them sleep full sweetly.

       This for the tenth counsel:
       That thou give trust never
     Unto oaths of foeman's kin,
     Be'st thou bane of his brother,
     Or hast thou felled his father;
     Wolf in young son waxes,
     Though he with gold be gladdened.

       For wrong and hatred
       Shall rest them never,
     Nay, nor sore sorrow.
       Both wit and weapons
       Well must the king have
     Who is fain to be the foremost.

       The last rede and eleventh:
       Until all ill look thou.
     And watch thy friends' ways ever
       Scarce durst I look
       For long life for thee, king:
     Strong trouble ariseth now already.

       XXI.




THE LAY CALLED THE SHORT LAY OF SIGURD.

     Sigurd of yore,
     Sought the dwelling of Giuki,
     As he fared, the young Volsung,
     After fight won;
     Troth he took
     From the two brethren;
     Oath swore they betwixt them,
     Those bold ones of deed.

     A may they gave to him
     And wealth manifold,
     Gudrun the young,
     Giuki's daughter:
     They drank and gave doom
     Many days together,
     Sigurd the young,
     And the sons of Giuki.

     Until they wended
     For Brynhild's wooing,
     Sigurd a-riding
     Amidst their rout;
     The wise young Volsung
     Who knew of all ways--
     Ah!  He had wed her,
     Had fate so willed it.

     Southlander Sigurd
     A naked sword,
     Bright, well grinded,
     Laid betwixt them;
     No kiss he won
     From the fair woman,
     Nor in arms of his
     Did the Hun King hold her,
     Since he gat the young maid
     For the son of Giuki.

     No lack in her life
     She wotted of now,
     And at her death-day
     No dreadful thing
     For a shame indeed
     Or a shame in seeming;
     But about and betwixt
     Went baleful fate.

     Alone, abroad,
     She sat of an evening,
     Of full many things
     She fall a-talking:
     "O for my Sigurd!
     I shall have death,
     Or my fair, my lovely,
     Laid in mine arms.

     "For the word once spoken,
     I sorrow sorely--
     His queen is Gudrun,
     I am wed to Gunnar;
     The dread Norns wrought for us
     A long while of woe."

     Oft with heart deep
     In dreadful thoughts,
     O'er ice-fields and ice-hills
     She fared a-night time,
     When he and Gudrun
     Were gone to their fair bed,
     And Sigurd wrapped
     The bed-gear round her.

     "Ah!  Now the Hun King
     His queen in arms holdeth,
     While love I go lacking,
     And all things longed for
     With no delight
     But in dreadful thought."

     These dreadful things
     Thrust her toward murder:
     --"Listen, Gunnar,
     For thou shalt lose
     My wide lands,
     Yea, me myself!
     Never love I my life,
     With thee for my lord--

     "I will fare back thither
     From whence I came,
     To my nighest kin
     And those that know me
     There shall I sit
     Sleeping my life away,
     Unless thou slayest
     Sigurd the Hun King,
     Making thy might more
     E'en than his might was!

     "Yea, let the son fare
     After the father,
     And no young wolf
     A long while nourish!
     For on earth man lieth
     Vengeance lighter,
     And peace shall be surer
     If the son live not."

     Adrad was Gunnar,
     Heavy-hearted was he,
     And in doubtful mood
     Day-long he sat.
     For naught he wotted,
     Nor might see clearly
     What was the seemliest
     Of deeds to set hand to;
     What of all deeds
     Was best to be done:
     For he minded the vows
     Sworn to the Volsung,
     And the sore wrong
     To be wrought against Sigurd.

     Wavered his mind
     A weary while,
     No wont it was
     Of those days worn by,
     That queens should flee
     From the realms of their kings.

     "Brynhild to me
     Is better than all,
     The child of Budli
     Is the best of women.
     Yea, and my life
     Will I lay down,
     Ere I am twinned
     From that woman's treasure."

     He bade call Hogni
     To the place where he bided;
     With all the trust that might be,
     Trowed he in him.

     "Wilt thou bewray Sigurd
     For his wealth's sake?
     Good it is to rule
     O'er the Rhine's metal;
     And well content
     Great wealth to wield,
     Biding in peace
     And blissful days."

     One thing alone Hogni
     Had for an answer:
     "Such doings for us
     Are naught seemly to do;
     To rend with sword
     Oaths once sworn,
     Oaths once sworn,
     And troth once plighted.

     "Nor know we on mould,
     Men of happier days,
     The while we four
     Rule over the folk;
     While the bold in battle,
     The Hun King, bides living.

     "And no nobler kin
     Shall be known afield,
     If our five sons
     We long may foster;
     Yea, a goodly stem
     Shall surely wax.
     --But I clearly see
     In what wise it standeth,
     Brynhild's sore urging
     O'ermuch on thee beareth.

     "Guttorm shall we
     Get for the slaying,
     Our younger brother
     Bare of wisdom;
     For he was out of
     All the oaths sworn,
     All the oaths sworn,
     And the plighted troth."

     Easy to rouse him
     Who of naught recketh!
     --Deep stood the sword
     In the heart of Sigurd.

     There, in the hall,
     Gat the high-hearted vengeance;
     For he can his sword
     At the reckless slayer:
     Out at Guttorm
     Flew Gram the mighty,
     The gleaming steel
     From Sigurd's hand.

     Down fell the slayer
     Smitten asunder;
     The heavy head
     And the hands fell one way,
     But the feet and such like
     Aback where they stood.

     Gudrun was sleeping
     Soft in the bed,
     Empty of sorrow
     By the side of Sigurd:
     When she awoke
     With all pleasure gone,
     Swimming in blood
     Of Frey's beloved.

     So sore her hands
     She smote together,
     That the great-hearted
     Gat raised in bed;
     --"O Gudrun, weep not
     So woefully,
     Sweet lovely bride,
     For thy brethren live for thee!

     "A young child have I
     For heritor;
     Too young to win forth
     From the house of his foes.--
     Black deeds and ill
     Have they been a-doing,
     Evil rede
     Have they wrought at last.

     "Late, late, rideth with them
     Unto the Thing,
     Such sister's son,
     Though seven thou bear,--
     --But well I wot
     Which way all goeth;
     Alone wrought Brynhild
     This bale against us.

     "That maiden loved me
     Far before all men,
     Yet wrong to Gunnar
     I never wrought;
     Brotherhood I heeded
     And all bounden oaths,
     That none should deem me
     His queen's darling."

     Weary sighed Gudrun,
     As the king gat ending,
     And so sore her hands
     She smote together,
     That the cups arow
     Rang out therewith,
     And the geese cried on high
     That were in the homefield.

     Then laughed Brynhild
     Budli's daughter,
     Once, once only,
     From out her heart;
     When to her bed
     Was borne the sound
     Of the sore greeting
     Of Giuki's daughter.

     Then, quoth Gunnar,
     The king, the hawk-bearer,
     "Whereas, thou laughest,
     O hateful woman,
     Glad on thy bed,
     No good it betokeneth:
     Why lackest thou else
     Thy lovely hue?
     Feeder of foul deeds,
     Fey do I deem thee,

     "Well worthy art thou
     Before all women,
     That thine eyes should see
     Atli slain of us;
     That thy brother's wounds
     Thou shouldest see a-bleeding,
     That his bloody hurts
     Thine hands should bind."

     "No man blameth thee, Gunnar,
     Thou hast fulfilled death's measure
     But naught Atli feareth
     All thine ill will;
     Life shall he lay down
     Later than ye,
     And still bear more might
     Aloft than thy might.

     "I shall tell thee, Gunnar,
     Though well the tale thou knowest,
     In what early days
     Ye dealt abroad your wrong:
     Young was I then,
     Worn with no woe,
     Good wealth I had
     In the house of my brother!

     "No mind had I
     That a man should have me,
     Or ever ye Giukings,
     Rode into our garth;
     There ye sat on your steeds
     Three kings of the people--
     --Ah!  That that faring
     Had never befallen!

     "Then spake Atli
     To me apart,
     And said that no wealth
     He would give unto me,
     Neither gold nor lands
     If I would not be wedded;
     Nay, and no part
     Of the wealth apportioned,
     Which in my first days
     He gave me duly;
     Which in my first days
     He counted down.

     "Wavered the mind
     Within me then,
     If to fight I should fall
     And the felling of folk,
     Bold in Byrny
     Because of my brother;
     A deed of fame
     Had that been to all folk,
     But to many a man
     Sorrow of mind.

     "So I let all sink
     Into peace at the last:
     More grew I minded
     For the mighty treasure,
     The red-shining rings
     Of Sigmund's son;
     For no man's wealth else
     Would I take unto me.

     "For myself had I given
     To that great king
     Who sat amid gold
     On the back of Grani;
     Nought were his eyes
     Like to your eyen,
     Nor in any wise
     Went his visage with yours;
     Though ye might deem you
     Due kings of men.

     "One I loved,
     One, and none other,
     The gold-decked may
     Had no doubtful mind;
     Thereof shall Atli
     Wot full surely,
     When he getteth to know
     I am gone to the dead.

     "Far be it from me,
     Feeble and wavering,
     Ever to love
     Another's love--
     --Yes shall my woe
     Be well avenged."

     Up rose Gunnar,
     The great men's leader,
     And cast his arms
     About the queen's neck;
     And all went nigh
     One after other,
     With their whole hearts
     Her heart to turn.

     But then all these
     From her neck she thrust,
     Of her long journey
     No man should let her.

     Then called he Hogni
     To have talk with him;
     "Let all folk go
     Forth into the hall,
     Thine with mine--
     --O need sore and mighty!--
     To wot if we yet
     My wife's parting may stay.
     Till with time's wearing
     Some hindrance wax."

     One answer Hogni
     Had for all;
     "Nay, let hard need
     Have rule thereover,
     And no man let her
     Of her long journey!
     Never born again,
     May she come back thence!

     "Luckless she came
     To the lap of her mother,
     Born into the world
     For utter woe,
     TO many a man
     For heart-whole mourning."

     Upraised he turned
     From the talk and the trouble,
     To where the gem-field
     Dealt out goodly treasure;
     As she looked and beheld
     All the wealth that she had,
     And the hungry bondmaids,
     And maids of the hall.

     With no good in her heart
     She donned her gold byrny,
     Ere she thrust the sword point
     Through the midst of her body:
     On the boister's far side
     Sank she adown,
     And, smitten with sword,
     Still bethought her of redes.

     "Let all come forth
     Who are fain the red gold,
     Or things less worthy
     To win from my hands;
     To each one I give
     A necklace gilt over,
     Wrought hangings and bed=gear,
     And bright woven weed."

     All they kept silence,
     And thought what to speak,
     Then all at once
     Answer gave:
     "Full enow are death-doomed,
     Fain are we to live yet,
     Maids of the hall
     All meet work winning."

     "From her wise heart at last
     The linen-clad damsel,
     The one of few years
     Gave forth the word:
     "I will that none driven
     By hand or by word,
     For our sake should lose
     Well-loved life.

     "Thou on the bones of you
     Surely shall burn,
     Less dear treasure
     At your departing
     Nor with Menia's Meal (1)
     Shall ye come to see me."

     "Sit thee down, Gunnar,
     A word must I say to thee
     Of the life's ruin
     Of thy lightsome bride--
     --Nor shall thy ship
     Swim soft and sweetly
     For all that I
     Lay life adown.

     "Sooner than ye might deem
     Shall ye make peace with Gudrun,
     For the wise woman
     Shall full in the young wife
     The hard memory
     Of her dead husband.

     "There is a may born
     Reared by her mother,
     Whiter and brighter
     Than is the bright day;
     She shall be Swanhild,
     She shall be Sunbeam.

     "Thou shalt give Gudrun
     Unto a great one,
     Noble, well-praised
     Of the world's folk;
     Not with her goodwill,
     Or love shalt thou give her;
     Yet will Atli
     Come to win her,
     My very brother,
     Born of Budli.

     --"Ah!  Many a memory
     Of how ye dealt with me,
     How sorely, how evilly
     Ye ever beguiled me,
     How all pleasure left me
     The while my life lasted--!

     "Fain wilt thou be
     Oddrun to win,
     But thy good liking
     Shall Atli let;
     But in secret wise
     Shall ye win together,
     And she shall love thee
     As I had loved thee,
     If in such wise
     Fare had willed it.

     "But with all ill
     Shall Atli sting thee,
     Into the strait worm-close
     Shall he cast thee.

     "But no long space
     Shall slip away
     Ere Atli too
     All life shall lose,
     Yea, all his weal
     With the life of his sons,
     For a dreadful bed
     Dights Gudrun for him,
     From a heart sore laden,
     With the sword's sharp edge.

     "More seemly for Gudrun,
     Your very sister,
     In death to wend after
     Her love first wed;
     Had but good rede
     To her been given,
     Or if her heart
     Had been like to my heart.

     --"Faint my speech groweth--
     But for our sake
     Ne'er shall she lose
     Her life beloved;
     The sea shall have her,
     High billows bear her
     Forth unto Jonakr's
     Fair land of his fathers.

     "There shall she bear sons,
     Stays of a heritage,
     Stays of a heritage,
     Jonakr's sons;
     And Swanhild shall she
     Send from the land,
     That may born of her,
     The may born of Sigurd.

     "Her shall bite
     The rede of Bikki,
     Whereas for no good
     Wins Jormunrek life;
     And so is clean perished
     All the kin of Sigurd,
     Yea, and more greeting,
     And more for Gudrun.

     "And now one prayer
     Yet pray I of thee--
     That last word of mine
     Here in the world--
     So broad on the field
     Be the burg of the dead
     That fair space may be left
     For us all to lie down,
     All those that died
     At Sigurd's death!

     "Hang round that burg
     Fair hangings and shields,
     Web by Gauls woven,
     And folk of the Gauls:
     There burn the Hun King
     Lying beside me.

     "But on the other side
     Burn by the Hun King
     Those who served me
     Strewn with treasure;
     Two at the head,
     And two at the feet,
     Two hounds therewith,
     And two hawks moreover:
     Then is all dealt
     With even dealing.

     "Lay there amidst us
     The right-dight metal,
     The sharp-edged steel,
     That so lay erst;
     When we both together
     Into one bed went,
     And were called by the name
     Of man and wife.

     "Never, then, belike
     Shall clash behind him
     Valhall's bright door
     With rings bedight:
     And if my fellowship
     Followeth after,
     In no wretched wise
     Then shall we wend.

     "For him shall follow
     My five bondmaids,
     My eight bondsmen,
     No borel folk:
     Yea, and my fosterer,
     And my father's dower
     That Budli of old days
     Gave to his dear child.

     "Much have I spoken,
     More would I speak,
     If the sword would give me
     Space for speech;
     But my words are waning,
     My wounds are swelling--
     Naught but truth have I told--
     --And now make I ending."

THE HELL-RIDE OF BRYNHILD.

After the death of Brynhild were made two bales, one for Sigurd, and
that was first burned; but Brynhild was burned on the other, and she was
in a chariot hung about with goodly hangings.

And so folk say that Brynhild drave in her chariot down along the way
to Hell, and passed by an abode where dwelt a certain giantess, and the
giantess spake:--

     THE GIANT-WOMAN
     "Nay, with my goodwill
     Never goest thou
     Through this stone-pillared
     Stead of mine!
     More seemly for thee
     To sit sewing the cloth,
     Than to go look on
     The love of another.

     "What dost thou, going
     From the land of the Gauls,
     O restless head,
     To this mine house?
     Golden girl, hast thou not,
     If thou listest to hearken,
     In sweet wise from thy hands
     The blood of men washen?"

     BRYNHILD
     "Nay, blame me naught,
     Bride of the rock-hall,
     Though I roved a warring
     In the days that were;
     The higher of us twain
     Shall I ever be holden
     When of our kind
     Men make account."

     THE GIANT-WOMAN
     "Thou, O Brynhild,
     Budli's daughter,
     Wert the worst ever born
     Into the world;
     For Giuki's children
     Death hast thou gotten,
     And turned to destruction
     Their goodly dwelling."

     BRYNHILD
     "I shall tell thee
     True tale from my chariot,
     O thou who naught wottest,
     If thou listest to wot;
     How for me they have gotten
     Those heirs of Giuki,
     A loveless life,
     A life of lies.

     "Hild under helm,
     The Hlymdale people,
     E'en those who knew me,
     Ever would call me.

     "The changeful shapes
     Of us eight sisters,
     The wise king bade
     Under oak-tree to bear;
     Of twelve winters was I,
     If thou listest to wot,
     When I sware to the young lord
     Oaths of love.

     "Thereafter gat I
     Mid the folk of the Goths,
     For Helmgunnar the old,
     Swift journey to Hell,
     And gave to Aud's brother
     The young, gain and glory;
     Whereof overwrath
     Waxed Odin with me.

     "So he shut me in shield-wall
     In Skata grove,
     Red shields and white
     Close set around me;
     And bade him alone
     My slumber to break
     Who in no land
     Knew how to fear.

     "He set round my hall,
     Toward the south quarter,
     The Bane of all trees
     Burning aloft;
     And ruled that he only
     Thereover should ride
     Who should bring me the gold
     O'er which Fafnir brooded.

     "Then upon Grani rode
     The goodly gold-strewer
     To where my fosterer
     Ruled his fair dwelling.
     He who alone there
     Was deemed best of all,
     The War-lord of the Danes,
     Well worthy of men.

     "In peace did we sleep
     Soft in one bed,
     As though he had been
     Naught but my brother:
     There as we lay
     Through eight nights wearing,
     No hand in love
     On each other we laid.

     "Yet thence blamed me, Gudrun,
     Giuki's daughter,
     That I had slept
     In the arms of Sigurd;
     And then I wotted
     As I fain had not wotted,
     That they had bewrayed me
     In my betrothals.

     "Ah!  For unrest
     All too long
     Are men and women
     Made alive!
     Yet we twain together
     Shall wear through the ages,
     Sigurd and I.--
     --Sink adown, O giant-wife!"




FRAGMENTS OF THE LAY OF BRYNHILD

     HOGNI SAID:
     "What hath wrought Sigurd
     Of any wrong-doing
     That the life of the famed one
     Thou art fain of taking?"

     GUNNAR SAID:
     "To me has Sigurd
     Sworn many oaths,
     Sworn many oaths,
     And sworn them lying,
     And he bewrayed me
     When it behoved him
     Of all folk to his troth
     To be the most trusty."

     HOGNI SAID:
     "Thee hath Brynhild
     Unto all bale,
     And all hate whetted,
     And a work of sorrow;
     For she grudges to Gudrun
     All goodly life;
     And to thee the bliss
     Of her very body."

    ..........

     Some the wolf roasted,
     Some minced the worm,
     Some unto Guttorm
     Gave the wolf-meat,
     Or ever they might
     In their lust for murder
     On the high king
     Lay deadly hand.

     Sigurd lay slain
     On the south of the Rhine
     High from the fair tree
     Croaked forth the raven,
     "Ah, yet shall Atli
     On you redden edges,
     The old oaths shall weigh
     On your souls, O warriors."

     Without stood Gudrun,
     Giuki's daughter,
     And the first word she said
     Was even this word:
     "Where then is Sigurd,
     Lord of the Warfolk,
     Since my kin
     Come riding the foremost?

     One word Hogni
     Had for an answer:
     "Our swords have smitten
     Sigurd asunder,
     And the grey horse hangs drooping
     O'er his lord lying dead."

     Then quoth Brynhild,
     Budli's daughter;
     "Good weal shall ye have
     Of weapons and lands,
     That Sigurd alone
     Would surely have ruled
     If he had lived
     But a little longer.

     "Ah, nothing seemly
     For Sigurd to rule
     Giuki's house
     And the folk of the Goths,
     When of him five sons
     For the slaying of men,
     Eager for battle,
     Should have been begotten!"

     Then laughed Brynhild--
     Loud rang the whole house--
     One laugh only
     From out her heart:
     "Long shall your bliss be
     Of lands and people,
     Whereas the famed lord
     You have felled to the earth!"

     Then spake Gudrun,
     Giuki's daughter;
     "Much thou speakest,
     Many things fearful,
     All grame be on Gunnar
     The bane of Sigurd!
     From a heart full of hate
     Shall come heavy vengeance."

     Forth sped the even
     Enow there was drunken,
     Full enow was there
     Of all soft speech;
     And all men got sleep
     When to bed they were gotten;
     Gunnar only lay waking
     Long after all men.

     His feet fell he to moving,
     Fell to speak to himself
     The waster of men,
     Still turned in his mind
     What on the bough
     Those twain would be saying,
     The raven and erne,
     As they rode their ways homeward.

     But Brynhild awoke,
     Budli's daughter,
     May of the shield-folk,
     A little ere morning:
     "Thrust ye on, hold ye back,
     --Now all harm is wrought,--
     To tell of my sorrow,
     Or to let all slip by me?"

     All kept silence
     After her speaking,
     None might know
     That woman's mind,
     Or why she must weep
     To tell of the work
     That laughing once
     Of men she prayed.

     BRYNHILD SPAKE:
     "In dreams, O Gunnar,
     Grim things fell on me;
     Dead-cold the hall was,
     And my bed was a-cold,
     And thou, lord, wert riding
     Reft of all bliss,
     Laden with fetters
     'Mid the host of thy foemen."

     "So now all ye,
     O House of the Niblungs,
     Shall be brought to naught,
     O ye oath-breakers!

     "Think'st thou not, Gunnar,
     How that betid,
     When ye let the blood run
     Both in one footstep?
     With ill reward
     Hast thou rewarded
     His heart so fain
     To be the foremost!

     "As well was seen
     When he rode his ways,
     That king of all worth,
     Unto my wooing;
     How the host-destroyer
     Held to the vows
     Sworn beforetime,
     Sworn to the young king.

     "For his wounding-wand
     All wrought with gold,
     The king beloved
     Laid between us;
     Without were its edges
     Wrought with fire,
     But with venom-drops
     Deep dyed within."

Thus this song telleth of the death of Sigurd, and setteth forth how
that they slew him without doors; but some say that they slew him within
doors, sleeping in his bed. But the Dutch Folk say that they slew him
out in the wood: and so sayeth the ancient song of Gudrun, that Sigurd
and the sons of Giuki were riding to the Thing whenas he was slain. But
all with one accord say that they bewrayed him in their troth with him,
and fell on him as he lay unarrayed and unawares.




THE SECOND OR ANCIENT LAY OF GUDRUN.

Thiodrek the King was in Atli's house, and had lost there the more part
of his men: so there Thiodrek and Gudrun bewailed their troubles one to
the other, and she spake and said:--

     A may of all mays
     My mother reared me
     Bright in bower;
     Well loved I my brethren,
     Until that Giuki
     With gold arrayed me,
     With gold arrayed me,
     And gave me to Sigurd.

     Such was my Sigurd,
     Among the sons of Giuki
     As is the green leek
     O'er the low grass waxen,
     Or a hart high-limbed
     Over hurrying deer,
     Or glede-red gold
     Over grey silver.

     Till me they begrudged,
     Those my brethren,
     The fate to have him,
     Who was first of all men;
     Nor might they sleep,
     Nor sit a-dooming,
     Ere they let slay
     My well-loved Sigurd.

     Grani ran to the Thing,
     There was clatter to hear,
     But never came Sigurd
     Himself thereunto;
     All the saddle-girt beasts
     With blood were besprinkled,
     As faint with the way
     Neath the slayers they went.

     Then greeting I went
     With Grani to talk,
     And with tear-furrowed cheeks
     I bade him tell all;
     But drooping laid Grani,
     His head in the grass,
     For the steed well wotted
     Of his master's slaying.

     A long while I wandered,
     Long my mind wavered,
     Ere the kings I might ask
     Concerning my king.

     Then Gunnar hung head,
     But Hogni told
     Of the cruel slaying
     Of my Sigurd:
     "On the water's far side
     Lies, smitten to death,
     The bane of Guttorm
     To the wolves given over.

     "Go, look on Sigurd,
     On the ways that go southward,
     There shalt thou hear
     The ernes high screaming,
     The ravens a-croaking
     As their meat they crave for;
     Thou shalt hear the wolves howling
     Over thine husband.

     "How hast thou, Hogni,
     The heart to tell me,
     Me of joy made empty,
     Of such misery?
     Thy wretched heart
     May the ravens tear
     Wide over the world,
     With no men mayst thou wend."

     One thing Hogni
     Had for answer,
     Fallen from his high heart,
     Full of all trouble:
     "More greeting yet,
     O Gudrun, for thee,
     If my heart the ravens
     Should rend asunder!"

     Thence I turned
     From the talk and the trouble
     To go a leasing (1)
     What the wolves had left me;
     No sigh I made
     No smote hands together,
     Nor did I wail
     As other women
     When I sat over
     My Sigurd slain.

     Night methought it,
     And the moonless dark,
     When I sat in sorrow
     Over Sigurd;
     Better than all things
     I deemed it would be
     If they would let me
     Cast my life by,
     Or burn me up
     As they burn the birch-wood.

     From the fell I wandered
     Five days together,
     Until the high hall
     Of Half lay before me;
     Seven seasons there
     I sat with Thora,
     The daughter of Hacon,
     Up in Denmark.

     My heart to gladden
     With gold she wrought
     Southland halls
     And swans of the Dane-folk;
     There had we painted
     The chiefs a-playing;
     Fair our hands wrought
     Folk of the kings.

     Red shields we did,
     Doughty knights of the Huns,
     Hosts spear-dight, hosts helm-dight,
     All a high king's fellows;
     And the ships of Sigmund
     From the land swift sailing;
     Heads gilt over
     And prows fair graven.

     On the cloth we broidered
     That tide of their battling,
     Siggeir and Siggar,
     South in Fion.

     Then heard Grimhild,
     The Queen of Gothland,
     How I was abiding,
     Weighed down with woe;
     And she thrust the cloth from her
     And called to her sons,
     And oft and eagerly
     Asked them thereof,
     Who for her son
     Would their sister atone,
     Who for her lord slain
     Would lay down weregild.

     Fain was Gunnar
     Gold to lay down
     All wrongs to atone for,
     And Hogni in likewise;
     Then she asked who was fain
     Of faring straightly,
     The steed to saddle
     To set forth the wain,
     The horse to back,
     And the hawk to fly,
     To shoot forth the arrow
     From out the yew-bow.

     Valdarr the Dane-king
     Came with Jarisleif
     Eymod the third went
     Then went Jarizskar;
     In kingly wise
     In they wended,
     The host of the Longbeards;
     Red cloaks had they,
     Byrnies short-cut,
     Helms strong hammered,
     Girt with glaives,
     And hair red-gleaming.

     Each would give me
     Gifts desired,
     Gifts desired,
     Speech dear to my heart,
     If they might yet,
     Despite my sorrow,
     Win back my trust,
     But in them nought I trusted.

     Then brought me Grimhild
     A beaker to drink of,
     Cold and bitter,
     Wrong's memory to quench;
     Made great was that drink
     With the might of the earth,
     With the death-cold sea
     And the blood that Son (2) holdeth.

     On that horn's face were there
     All the kin of letters
     Cut aright and reddened,
     How should I rede them rightly?

     The ling-fish long
     Of the land of Hadding,
     Wheat-ears unshorn,
     And wild things' inwards.

     In that mead were mingled
     Many ills together,
     Blood of all the wood,
     And brown-burnt acorns;
     The black dew of the hearth, (3)
     And god-doomed dead beasts' inwards
     And the swine's liver sodden,
     For wrongs late done that deadens.

     Then waned my memory
     When that was within me,
     Of my lord 'mid the hall
     By the iron laid low.
     Three kings came
     Before my knees
     Ere she herself
     Fell to speech with me.

     "I will give to thee, Gudrun,
     Gold to be glad with,
     All the great wealth
     Of thy father gone from us,
     Rings of red gold
     And the great hall of Lodver,
     And all fair hangings left
     By the king late fallen.

     "Maids of the Huns
     Woven pictures to make,
     And work fair in gold
     Till thou deem'st thyself glad.
     Alone shalt thou rule
     O'er the riches of Budli,
     Shalt be made great with gold,
     And be given to Atli."

     "Never will I
     Wend to a husband,
     Or wed the brother
     Of Queen Brynhild;
     Naught it beseems me
     With the son of Budli
     Kin to bring forth,
     Or to live and be merry."

     "Nay, the high chiefs
     Reward not with hatred,
     For take heed that I
     Was the first in this tale!
     To thy heart shall it be
     As if both these had life,
     Sigurd and Sigmund,
     When thou hast borne sons."

     "Naught may I, Grimhild,
     Seek after gladness,
     Nor deem aught hopeful
     Of any high warrior,
     Since wolf and raven
     Were friends together,
     The greedy, the cruel,
     O'er great Sigurd's heart-blood."

     "Of all men that can be
     For the noblest of kin
     This king have I found,
     And the foremost of all;
     Him shalt thou have
     Till with eld thou art heavy--
     Be thou ever unwed,
     If thou wilt naught of him!"

     "Nay, nay, bid me not
     With thy words long abiding
     To take unto me
     That balefullest kin;
     This king shall bid Gunnar
     Be stung to his bane,
     And shall cut the heart
     From out of Hogni.

     "Nor shall I leave life
     Ere the keen lord,
     The eager in sword-play,
     My hand shall make end of."

     Grimhild a-weeping
     Took up the word then,
     When the sore bale she wotted
     Awaiting her sons,
     And the bane hanging over
     Her offspring beloved.

     "I will give thee, moreover,
     Great lands, many men,
     Wineberg and Valberg,
     If thou wilt but have them;
     Hold them lifelong,
     And live happy, O daughter!"

     "Then him must I take
     From among kingly men,
     'Gainst my heart's desire,
     From the hands of my kinsfolk;
     But no joy I look
     To have from that lord:
     Scarce may my brother's bane
     Be a shield to my sons."

     Soon was each warrior
     Seen on his horse,
     But the Gaulish women
     Into wains were gotten;
     Then seven days long
     O'er a cold land we rode,
     And for seven other
     Clove we the sea-waves.
     But with the third seven
     O'er dry land we wended.

     There the gate-wardens
     Of the burg, high and wide,
     Unlooked the barriers
     Ere the burg-garth we rode to--

    ............

     Atli woke me
     When meseemed I was
     Full evil of heart
     For my kin dead slain.

     "In such wise did the Norns
     Wake me or now."--
     Fain was he to know
     Of this ill foreshowing--
     "That methought, O Gudrun,
     Giuki's daughter,
     That thou setst in my heart
     A sword wrought for guile."

     "For fires tokening I deem it
     That dreaming of iron,
     But for pride and for lust
     The wrath of fair women
     Against some bale
     Belike, I shall burn thee
     For thy solace and healing
     Though hateful thou art."

     "In the fair garth methought
     Had saplings fallen
     E'en such as I would
     Should have waxen ever;
     Uprooted were these,
     And reddened with blood,
     And borne to the bench,
     And folk bade me eat of them.

     "Methought from my hand then
     Went hawks a-flying
     Lacking their meat
     To the land of all ill;
     Methought that their hearts
     Mingled with honey,
     Swollen with blood
     I ate amid sorrow.

     "Lo, next two whelps
     From my hands I loosened,
     Joyless were both,
     And both a-howling;
     And now their flesh
     Became naught but corpses,
     Whereof must I eat
     But sore against my will."

     "O'er the prey of the fishers
     Will folk give doom;
     From the bright white fish
     The heads will they take;
     Within a few nights,
     Fey as they are,
     A little ere day
     Of that draught will they eat."

     "Ne'er since lay I down,
     Ne'er since would I sleep,
     Hard of heart, in my bed:--
     That deed have I to do. (4)


  ENDNOTES:
  (1)  The original has "a vid lesa".  "Leasing" is the word still
       used for gleaning in many country sides in England.
  (2)  Son was the vessel into which was poured the blood of
       Quasir, the God of Poetry.
  (3)  This means soot.
  (4)  The whole of this latter part is fragmentary and obscure;
       there seems wanting to two of the dreams some trivial
       interpretation by Gudrun, like those given by Hogni to
       Kostbera in the Saga, of which nature, of course, the
       interpretation contained in the last stanza but one is, as
       we have rendered it: another rendering, from the different
       reading of the earlier edition of "Edda" (Copenhagen, 1818)
       would make this refer much more directly to the slaying of
       her sons by Gudrun.




THE SONG OF ATLI.

Gudrun, Giuki's daughter, avenger her brethren, as is told far and wide;
first she slew the sons of Atli, and then Atli himself; and she burned
the hall thereafter, and all the household with it: and about these
matters is this song made:--

     In days long gone
     Sent Atli to Gunnar
     A crafty one riding,
     Knefrud men called him;
     To Giuki's garth came he,
     To the hall of Gunnar,
     To the benches gay-dight,
     And the gladsome drinking.

     There drank the great folk
     'Mid the guileful one's silence,
     Drank wine in their fair hall:
     The Huns' wrath they feared
     When Knefrud cried
     In his cold voice,
     As he sat on the high seat,
     That man of the Southland:

     "Atli has sent me
     Riding swift on his errands
     On the bit-griping steed
     Through dark woodways unbeaten,
     To bid thee, King Gunnar,
     Come to his fair bench
     With helm well-adorned,
     To the house of King Atli.

     "Shield shall ye have there
     And spears ashen-shafted,
     Helms ruddy with gold,
     And hosts of the Huns;
     Saddle-gear silver gilt,
     Shirts red as blood,
     The hedge of the warwife,
     And horses bit-griping.

     "And he saith he will give you
     Gnitaheath widespread,
     And whistling spears
     And prows well-gilded,
     Might wealth
     With the stead of Danpi,
     And that noble wood
     Men name the Murkwood."

     Then Gunnar turned head
     And spake unto Hogni:
     "What rede from thee, high one,
     Since such things we hear?
     No gold know I
     On Gnitaheath,
     That we for our parts
     Have not portion as great.

     "Seven halls we have
     Fulfilled of swords,
     And hilts of gold
     Each sword there has;
     My horse is the best,
     My blade is the keenest;
     Fair my bow o'er the bench is,
     Gleams my byrny with gold;
     Brightest helm, brightest shield,
     From Kiar's dwelling ere brought--
     Better all things I have
     Than all things of the Huns."

     HOGNI SAID:
     "What mind has our sister
     That a ring she hath sent us
     In weed of wolves clad?
     Bids she not to be wary?
     For a wolf's hair I found
     The fair ring wreathed about;
     Wolf beset shall the way be
     If we wend on this errand."

     No sons whetted Gunnar,
     Nor none of his kin,
     Nor learned men nor wise men,
     Nor such as were mighty.
     Then spake Gunnar
     E'en as a king should speak,
     Glorious in mead-hall
     From great heart and high:

     "Rise up now, Fiornir,
     Forth down the benches
     Let the gold-cups of great ones
     Pass in hands of my good-men!
     Well shall we drink wine,
     Draughts dear to our hearts,
     Though the last of all feasts
     In our fair house this be!

     "For the wolves shall rule
     O'er the wealth of the Niblungs,
     With the pine-woods' wardens
     In Gunnar perish:
     And the black-felled bears
     With fierce teeth shall bite
     For the glee of the dog kind,
     If again comes not Gunnar."

     Then good men never shamed,
     Greeting aloud,
     Led the great king of men
     From the garth of his home;
     And cried the fair son
     Of Hogni the king:
     "Fare happy, O Lords,
     Whereso your hearts lead you!"

     Then the bold knights
     Let their bit-griping steeds
     Wend swift o'er the fells,
     Tread the murk-wood unknown,
     All the Hunwood was shaking
     As the hardy ones fared there;
     O'er the green meads they urged
     Their steeds shy of the goad.

     Then Atli's land saw they;
     Great towers and strong,
     And the bold men of Bikki,
     Aloft on the burg:
     The Southland folks' hall
     Set with benches about,
     Dight with bucklers well bounden,
     And bright white shining shields.

     There drank Atli,
     The awful Hun king,
     Wine in his fair hall;
     Without were the warders,
     Gunnar's folk to have heed of,
     Lest they had fared thither
     With the whistling spear
     War to wake 'gainst the king.

     But first came their sister
     As they came to the hall,
     Both her brethren she met,
     With beer little gladdened:
     "Bewrayed art thou, Gunnar!
     What dost thou great king
     To deal war to the Huns?
     Go thou swift from the hall!

     Better, brother, hadst thou
     Fared here in thy byrny
     Than with helm gaily dight
     Looked on Atli's great house:
     Them hadst sat then in saddle
     Through days bright with the sun
     Fight to awaken
     And fair fields to redden:

     "O'er the folk fate makes pale
     Should the Norn's tears have fallen,
     The shield mays of the Huns
     Should have known of all sorrow;
     And King Atli himself
     To worm-close should be brought;
     But now is the worm-close
     Kept but for thee."

     Then spake Gunnar
     Great 'mid the people:
     "Over-late sister
     The Niblungs to summon;
     A long way to seek
     The helping of warriors,
     The high lord unshamed,
     From the hills of the Rhine!"

    ..............

     Seven Hogni beat down
     With his sword sharp-grinded,
     And the eighth man he thrust
     Amidst of the fire.
     Ever so shall famed warrior
     Fight with his foemen,
     As Hogni fought
     For the hand of Gunnar.

     But on Gunnar they fell,
     And set him in fetters,
     And bound hard and fast
     That friend of Burgundians;
     Then the warrior they asked
     If he would buy life,
     But life with gold
     That king of the Goths.

     Nobly spake Gunnar,
     Great lord of the Niblungs;
     "Hogni's bleeding heart first
     Shall lie in mine hand,
     Cut from the breast
     Of the bold-riding lord,
     With bitter-sharp knife
     From the son of the king."

     With guile the great one
     Would they beguile,
     On the wailing thrall
     Laid they hand unwares,
     And cut the heart
     From out of Hjalli,
     Laid it bleeding on trencher
     And bare it to Gunnar.

     "Here have I the heart
     Of Hjalli the trembler,
     Little like the heart
     Of Hogni the hardy:
     As much as it trembleth
     Laid on the trencher
     By the half more it trembled
     In the breast of him hidden."

     Then laughed Hogni
     When they cut the heart from him,
     From the crest-smith yet quick,
     Little thought he to quail.
     The hard acorn of thought
     From the high king they took,
     Laid it bleeding on trencher
     And bare it Gunnar.

     "Here have I the heart
     Of Hogni the hardy,
     Little like to the heart
     Of Hjalli the trembler.
     Howso little it quaketh
     Laid here on the dish,
     Yet far less it quaked
     In the breast of him laid.

     "So far mayst thou bide
     From men's eyen, O Atli,
     As from that treasure
     Thou shalt abide!

     "Behold in my heart
     Is hidden for ever
     That hoard of the Niblungs,
     Now Hogni is dead.
     Doubt threw me two ways
     While the twain of us lived,
     But all that is gone
     Now I live on alone.

     "The great Rhine shall rule
     O'er the hate-raising treasure,
     That gold of the Niblungs,
     The seed of the gods:
     In the weltering water
     Shall that wealth lie a-gleaming,
     Or it shine on the hands
     Of the children of Huns!"

     Then cried Atli,
     King of the Hun-folk,
     "Drive forth your wains now
     The slave is fast bounden."
     And straightly thence
     The bit-shaking steeds
     Drew the hoard-warden,
     The war-god to his death.

     Atli the great king,
     Rode upon Glaum,
     With shields set round about,
     And sharp thorns of battle:
     Gudrun, bound by wedlock
     To these, victory made gods of,
     Held back her tears
     As the hall she ran into.

     "Let it fare with thee, Atli,
     E'en after thine oaths sworn
     To Gunnar fell often;
     Yea, oaths sworn of old time,
     By the sun sloping southward,
     By the high burg of Sigry,
     By the fair bed of rest,
     By the red ring of Ull!"

     Now a host of men
     Cast the high king alive
     Into a close
     Crept o'er within
     With most foul worms,
     Fulfilled of all venom,
     Ready grave to dig
     In his doughty heart.

     Wrathful-hearted he smote
     The harp with his hand,
     Gunnar laid there alone;
     And loud rang the strings.--
     In such wise ever
     Should hardy ring-scatterer
     Keep gold from all folk
     In the garth of his foeman.

     Then Atli would wend
     About his wide land,
     On his steed brazen shod,
     Back from the murder.
     Din there was in the garth,
     All thronged with the horses;
     High the weapon-song rose
     From men come from the heath.

     Out then went Gudrun,
     'Gainst Atli returning,
     With a cup gilded over,
     To greet the land's ruler;
     "Come, then, and take it,
     King glad in thine hall,
     From Gudrun's hands,
     For the hell-farers groan not!"

     Clashed the beakers of Atli,
     Wine-laden on bench,
     As in hall there a-gathered,
     The Huns fell a-talking,
     And the long-bearded eager ones
     Entered therein,
     From a murk den new-come,
     From the murder of Gunnar.

     Then hastened the sweet-faced
     Delight of the shield-folk,
     Bright in the fair hall,
     Wine to bear to them:
     The dreadful woman
     Gave dainties withal
     To the lords pale with fate,
     Laid strange word upon Atli:

     "The hearts of thy sons
     Hast thou eaten, sword-dealer,
     All bloody with death
     And drenched with honey:
     In most heavy mood
     Brood o'er venison of men!
     Drink rich draughts therewith,
     Down the high benches send it!

     "Never callest thou now
     From henceforth to thy knee
     Fair Erp or fair Eiril,
     Bright-faced with the drink;
     Never seest thou them now
     Amidmost the seat,
     Scattering the gold,
     Or shafting of spears;
     Manes trimming duly,
     Or driving steeds forth!"

     Din arose from the benches,
     Dread song of men was there,
     Noise 'mid the fair hangings,
     As all Hun's children wept;
     All saving Gudrun,
     Who never gat greeting,
     For her brethren bear-hardy
     For her sweet sons and bright,
     The young ones, the simple
     Once gotten with Atli.

    ...............

     The seed of gold
     Sowed the swan-bright woman,
     Rings of red gold
     She gave to the house-carls;
     Fate let she wax,
     Let the bright gold flow forth,
     In naught spared that woman
     The store-houses' wealth.

     Atli unaware
     Was a-weary with drink;
     No weapon had he,
     No heeding of Gudrun--
     Ah, the pity would be better,
     When in soft wise they twain
     Would full often embrace
     Before the great lords!

     To the bed with sword-point
     Blood gave she to drink
     With a hand fain of death,
     And she let the dogs loose:
     Then in from the hall-door--
     --Up waked the house-carls--
     Hot brands she cast,
     Gat revenge for her brethren.

     To the flame gave she all
     Who therein might be found;
     Fell adown the old timbers,
     Reeked all treasure-houses;
     There the shield-mays were burnt,
     Their lives' span brought to naught;
     In the fierce fire sank down
     All the stead of the Budlungs.

     Wide told of is this--
     Ne'er sithence in the world,
     Thus fared bride clad in byrny
     For her brothers' avenging;
     For behold, this fair woman
     To three kings of the people,
     Hath brought very death
     Or ever she died!




THE WHETTING OF GUDRUN.

Gudrun went down unto the sea whenas she had slain Atli, and she cast
herself therein, for she was fain to end her life: but nowise might
she drown. She drave over the firths to the land of King Jonakr, and he
wedded her, and their sons were Sorli, and Erp, and Hamdir, and there
was Swanhild, Sigurd's daughter, nourished: and she was given to
Jormunrek the Mighty. Now Bikki was a man of his, and gave such counsel
to Randver, the king's son, as that he should take her; and with that
counsel were the young folk well content.

Then Bikki told the king, and the king let hang Randver, but bade
Swanhild be trodden under horses' feet. But when Gudrun heard thereof,
she spake to her sons--

     Words of strife heard I,
     Huger than any,
     Woeful words spoken,
     Sprung from all sorrow,
     When Gudrun fierce-hearted
     With the grimmest of words
     Whetter her sons
     Unto the slaying.

     "Why are ye sitting here?
     Why sleep ye life away?
     Why doth it grieve you nought?
     Glad words to speak,
     Now when your sister--
     Young of years was she--
     Has Jormunrek trodden
     With the treading of horses?--

     "Black horses and white
     In the highway of warriors;
     Grey horses that know
     The roads of the Goths.--

     "Little like are ye grown
     To that Gunnar of old days!
     Nought are your hearts
     As the heart of Hogni!
     Well would ye seek
     Vengeance to win
     If your mood were in aught
     As the mood of my brethren,
     Or the hardy hearts
     Of the Kings of the Huns!"

     Then spake Hamdir,
     The high-hearted--
     "Little didst thou
     Praise Hogni's doings,
     When Sigurd woke
     From out of sleep,
     And the blue-white bed-gear
     Upon thy bed
     Grew red with man's blood--
     With the blood of thy mate!

     "Too baleful vengeance
     Wroughtest thou for thy brethren
     Most sore and evil
     When thy sons thou slewedst,
     Else all we together
     On Jormunrek
     Had wrought sore vengeance
     For that our sister.

     "Come, bring forth quickly
     The Hun kings' bright gear,
     Since thou has urged us
     Unto the sword-Thing!"

     Laughing went Gudrun
     To the bower of good gear,
     Kings' crested helms
     From chests she drew,
     And wide-wrought byrnies
     Bore to her sons:
     Then on their horses
     Load laid the heroes.

     Then spake Hamdir,
     The high-hearted--
     "Never cometh again
     His mother to see
     The spear-god laid low
     In the land of the Goths.
     That one arvel mayst thou
     For all of us drink,
     For sister Swanhild,
     And us thy sons."

     Greeted Gudrun
     Giuki's daughter;
     Sorrowing she went
     In the forecourt to sit,
     That she might tell,
     With cheeks tear-furrowed,
     Her weary wail
     In many a wise.

     "Three fires I knew,
     Three hearths I knew,
     To three husbands' houses
     Have I been carried;
     And better than all
     Had been Sigurd alone,
     He whom my brethren
     Brought to his bane.

     "Such sore grief as that
     Methought never should be,
     Yet more indeed
     Was left for my torment
     Then, when the great ones
     Gave me to Atli.

     "My fair bright boys
     I bade unto speech,
     Nor yet might I win
     Weregild for my bale,
     Ere I had hewn off
     Those Niblungs' heads.

     "To the sea-strand I went
     With the Norns sorely wroth,
     For I would thrust from me
     The storm of their torment;
     But the high billows
     Would not drown, but bore me
     Forth, till I stepped a-land
     Longer to live.

     "Then I went a-bed--
     --Ah, better in the old days,
     This was the third time!--
     To a king of the people;
     Offspring I brought forth,
     Props of a fair house,
     Props of a fair house,
     Jonakr's fair sons.

     "But around Swanhild
     Bond-maidens sat,
     Her, that of all mine
     Most to my heart was;
     Such was my Swanhild,
     In my hall's midmost,
     As is the sunbeam
     Fair to beheld.

     "In gold I arrayed her,
     And goodly raiment,
     Or ever I gave her
     To the folk of the Goths.
     That was the hardest
     Of my heavy woes,
     When the bright hair,--
     O the bright hair of Swanhild!--
     In the mire was trodden
     By the treading of horses.

     "This was the sorest,
     When my love, my Sigurd,
     Reft of glory
     In his bed gat ending:
     But this the grimmest
     When glittering worms
     Tore their way
     Through the heart of Gunnar.

     "But this the keenest
     When they cut to the quick
     Of the hardy heart
     Of the unfeared Hogni.
     Of much of bale I mind me,
     Of many griefs I mind me;
     Why should I sit abiding
     Yet more bale and more?

     "Thy coal-black horse,
     O Sigurd, bridle,
     The swift on the highway!
     O let him speed hither!
     Here sitteth no longer
     Son or daughter,
     More good gifts
     To give to Gudrun!

     "Mindst thou not, Sigurd,
     Of the speech betwixt us,
     When on one bed
     We both sat together,
     O my great king--
     That thou wouldst come to me
     E'en from the hall of Hell,
     I to thee from the fair earth?

     "Pile high, O earls
     The oaken pile,
     Let it be the highest
     That ever queen had!
     Let the fire burn swift,
     My breast with woe laden,
     And thaw all my heart,
     Hard, heavy with sorrow!"

     Now may all earls
     Be bettered in mind,
     May the grief of all maidens
     Ever be minished,
     For this tale of sorrow
     So told to its ending.




THE LAY OF HAMDIR

     Great deeds of bale
     In the garth began,
     At the sad dawning
     The tide of Elves' sorrow
     When day is a-waxing
     And man's grief awaketh,
     And the sorrow of each one
     The early day quickeneth.

     Not now, not now,
     Nor yesterday,
     But long ago
     Has that day worn by,
     That ancientest time,
     The first time to tell of,
     Then, whenas Gudrun,
     Born of Giuki,
     Whetter her sons
     To Swanhild's avenging.

     "Your sister's name
     Was naught but Swanhild,
     Whom Jormunrek
     With horses has trodden!--
     White horses and black
     On the war-beaten way,
     Grey horses that go
     On the roads of the Goths.

     "All alone am I now
     As in holt is the aspen;
     As the fir-tree of boughs,
     So of kin am I bare;
     As bare of things longed for
     As the willow of leaves
     When the bough-breaking wind
     The warm day endeth.

     "Few, sad, are ye left
     O kings of my folk!
     Yet alone living
     Last shreds of my kin!

     "Ah, naught are ye grown
     As that Gunnar of old days;
     Naught are your hearts
     As the heart of Hogni!
     Well would ye seek
     Vengeance to win
     If your hearts were in aught
     As the hearts of my brethren!"

     Then spake Hamdir
     The high-hearted:
     "Nought hadst thou to praise
     The doings of Hogni,
     When they woke up Sigurd
     From out of slumber,
     And in bed thou sat'st up
     'Mid the banes-men's laughter.

     "Then when thy bed=gear,
     Blue-white, well woven
     By art of craftsmen
     All swam with thy king's blood;
     The Sigurd died,
     O'er his dead corpse thou sattest,
     Not heeding aught gladsome,
     Since Gunnar so willed it.

     "Great grief for Atli
     Gatst thou by Erp's murder,
     And the end of thine Eitil,
     But worse grief for thyself.
     Good to use sword
     For the slaying of others
     In such wise that its edge
     Shall not turn on ourselves!"

     Then well spake Sorli
     From a heart full of wisdom:
     "No words will I
     Make with my mother,
     Though both ye twain
     Need words belike--
     What askest thou, Gudrun,
     To let thee go greeting?

     "Weep for thy brethren,
     Weep for thy sweet sons,
     And thy nighest kinsfolk
     Laid by the fight-side!
     Yea, and thou Gudrun,
     May'st greet for us twain
     Sitting fey on our steeds
     Doomed in far lands to die."

     From the garth forth they went
     With hearts full of fury,
     Sorli and Hamdir,
     The sons of Gudrun,
     And they met on the way
     The wise in all wiles:
     "And thou little Erp,
     What helping from thee?"

     He of alien womb
     Spake out in such wise:
     "Good help for my kin,
     Such as foot gives to foot,
     Or flesh-covered hand
     Gives unto hand!"

     "What helping for foot
     That help that foot giveth,
     Or for flesh-covered hand
     The helping of hand?"

     Then spake Erp
     Yet once again
     Mock spake the prince
     As he sat on his steed:
     "Fool's deed to show
     The way to a dastard!"
     "Bold beyond measure,"
     Quoth they, "is the base-born!"

     Out from the sheath
     Drew they the sheath-steel,
     And the glaives' edges played
     For the pleasure of hell;
     By the third part they minished
     The might that they had,
     Their young kin they let lie
     A-cold on the earth.

     Then their fur-cloaks they shook
     And bound fast their swords,
     In webs goodly woven
     Those great ones were clad;
     Young they went o'er the fells
     Where the dew was new-fallen
     Swift, on steeds of the Huns,
     Heavy vengeance to wreak.

     Forth stretched the ways,
     And an ill way they found,
     Yea, their sister's son (1)
     Hanging slain upon tree--
     Wolf-trees by the wind made cold
     At the town's westward
     Loud with cranes' clatter--
     Ill abiding there long!

     Din in the king's hall
     Of men merry with drink,
     And none might hearken
     The horses' tramping
     Or ever the warders
     Their great horn winded.

     Then men went forth
     To Jormunrek
     To tell of the heeding
     Of men under helm:
     "Give ye good counsel!
     Great ones are come hither,
     For the wrong of men mighty
     Was the may to death trodden."

     "Loud Jormunrek laughed,
     And laid hand to his beard,
     Nor bade bring his byrny,
     But with the wine fighting,
     Shook his red locks,
     On his white shield sat staring,
     And in his hand
     Swung the gold cup on high.

     "Sweet sight for me
     Those twain to set eyes on,
     Sorli and Hamdir,
     Here in my hall!
     Then with bowstrings
     Would I bind them,
     And hang the good Giukings
     Aloft on the gallows!"

    ..............

     Then spake Hrothglod
     From off the high steps,
     Spake the slim-fingered
     Unto her son,--
     --For a threat was cast forth
     Of what ne'er should fall--
     "Shall two men alone
     Two hundred Gothfolk
     Bind or bear down
     In the midst of their burg?"

    ...............

     Strife and din in the hall,
     Cups smitten asunder
     Men lay low in blood
     From the breasts of Goths flowing.

     Then spake Hamdir,
     The high-hearted:
     "Thou cravedst, O king,
     From the coming of us,
     The sons of one mother,
     Amidmost thine hall--
     Look on these hands of thine,
     Look on these feet of thine,
     Cast by us, Jormunrek,
     On to the flame!"

     Then cried aloud
     The high Gods' kinsman (2)
     Bold under byrny,--
     Roared he as bears roar;
     "Stones to the stout ones
     That the spears bite not,
     Nor the edges of steel,
     These sons of Jonakr!"

    ..............

     QUOTH SORLI:
     "Bale, brother, wroughtst thou
     By that bag's (3) opening,
     Oft from that bag
     Rede of bale cometh!
     Heart hast thou, Hamdir,
     If thou hadst heart's wisdom
     Great lack in a man
     Who lacks wisdom and lore!"

     HAMDIR SAID:
     "Yes, off were the head
     If Erp were alive yet,
     Our brother the bold
     Whom we slew by the way;
     The far-famed through the world--
     Ah, the fares drave me on,
     And the man war made holy,
     There must I slay!"

     SORLI SAID:
       "Unmeet we should do
       As the doings of wolves are,
     Raising wrong each 'gainst other
       As the dogs of the Norns,
       The greedy ones nourished
     In waste steads of the world.

     In strong wise have we fought,
     On Goths' corpses we stand,
     Beat down by our edges,
     E'en as ernes on the bough.
     Great fame our might winneth,
     Die we now, or to-morrow,--
     No man lives till eve
     Whom the fates doom at morning."
     At the hall's gable-end
     Fell Sorli to earth,
     But Hamdir lay low
     At the back of the houses.

Now this is called the Ancient Lay of Hamdir.

THE LAMENT OF ODDRUN.

There was a king hight Heidrik, and his daughter was called Borgny, and
the name of her lover was Vilmund. Now she might nowise be made lighter
of a child she travailed with, before Oddrun, Atil's sister, came to
her,--she who had been the love of Gunnar, Giuki's son. But of their
speech together has this been sung:

     I have hear tell
     In ancient tales
     How a may there came
     To Morna-land,
     Because no man
     On mould abiding
     For Heidrik's daughter
     Might win healing.

     All that heard Oddrun,
     Atil's sister,
     How that the damsel
     Had heavy sickness,
     So she led from stall
     Her bridled steed,
     And on the swart one
     Laid the saddle.

     She made her horse wend
     O'er smooth ways of earth,
     Until to a high-built
     Hall she came;
     Then the saddle she had
     From the hungry horse,
     And her ways wended
     In along the wide hall,
     And this word first
     Spake forth therewith:

     "What is most famed,
     Afield in Hunland,
     Or what may be
     Blithest in Hunland?"

     QUOTH THE HANDMAID:
     "Here lieth Borgny,
     Borne down by trouble,
     Thy sweet friend, O Oddrun,
     See to her helping!"

     ODDRUN SAID:
     "Who of the lords
     Hath laid this grief on her,
     Why is the anguish
     Of Borgny so weary?"

     THE HANDMAID SAID:
     "He is hight Vilmund,
     Friend of hawk-bearers,
     He wrapped the damsel
     In the warm bed-gear
     Five winters long
     Without her father's wotting."

     No more than this
     They spake methinks;
     Kind sat she down
     By the damsel's knee;
     Mightily sand Oddrun,
     Sharp piercing songs
     By Borgny's side:

     Till a maid and a boy
     Might tread on the world's ways,
     Blithe babes and sweet
     Of Hogni's bane:
     Then the damsel forewearied
     The word took up,
     The first word of all
     That had won from her:

     "So may help thee
     All helpful things,
     Fey and Freyia,
     And all the fair Gods,
     As thou hast thrust
     This torment from me!"

     ODDRUN SAID:
     "Yet no heart had I
     For thy helping,
     Since never wert thou
     Worthy of helping,
     But my word I held to,
     That of old was spoken
     When the high lords
     Dealt out the heritage,
     That every soul
     I would ever help."

     BORGNY SAID:
     "Right mad art thou, Oddrun,
     And reft of thy wits,
     Whereas thou speakest
     Hard words to me
     Thy fellow ever
     Upon the earth
     As of brothers twain,
     We had been born."

     ODDRUN SAID:
     "Well I mind me yet,
     What thou saidst that evening,
     Whenas I bore forth
     Fair drink for Gunnar;
     Such a thing, saidst thou,
     Should fall out never,
     For any may
     Save for me alone."

     Mind had the damsel
     Of the weary day
     Whenas the high lords
     Dealt out the heritage,
     And she sat her down,
     The sorrowful woman,
     To tell of the bale,
     And the heavy trouble.

     "Nourished was I
     In the hall of kings--
     Most folk were glad--
     'Mid the council of great ones:
     In fair life lived I,
     And the wealth of my father
     For five winters only,
     While yet he had life.

     "Such were the last words
     That ever he spake,
     The king forewearied,
     Ere his ways he went;
     For he bade folk give me
     The gold red-gleaming,
     And give me in Southlands
     To the son of Grimhild.

     "But Brynhild he bade
     To the helm to betake her,
     And said that Death-chooser
     She should become;
     And that no better
     Might ever be born
     Into the world,
     If fate would not spoil it.

     "Brynhild in bower
     Sewed at her broidery,
     Folk she had
     And fair lands about her;
     Earth lay a-sleeping,
     Slept the heavens aloft
     When Fafnir's-bane
     The burg first saw.

     "Then was war waged
     With the Welsh-wrought sword
     And the burg all broken
     That Brynhild owned;
     Nor wore long space,
     E'en as well might be,
     Ere all those wiles
     Full well she knew.

     "Hard and dreadful
     Was the vengeance she drew down,
     So that all we
     Have woe enow.
     Through all lands of the world
     Shall that story fare forth
     How she did her to death
     For the death of Sigurd.

     "But therewithal Gunnar
     The gold-scatterer
     Did I fall to loving
     And should have loved him.
     Rings of red gold
     Would they give to Atli,
     Would give to my brother
     Things goodly and great.

     "Yea, fifteen steads
     Would they give for me,
     And the load of Grani
     To have as a gift;
     But then spake Atli,
     That such was his will,
     Never gift to take
     From the sons of Giuki.

     "But we in nowise
     Might love withstand,
     And mine head must I lay
     On my love, the ring-breaker;
     And many there were
     Among my kin,
     Who said that they
     Had seen us together.

     "Then Atli said
     That I surely never
     Would fall to crime
     Or shameful folly:
     But now let no one
     For any other,
     That shame deny
     Where love has dealing.

     "For Atli sent
     His serving-folk
     Wide through the murkwood
     Proof to win of me,
     And thither they came
     Where they ne'er should have come,
     Where one bed we twain
     Had dight betwixt us.

     "To those men had we given
     Rings of red gold,
     Naught to tell
     Thereof to Atli,
     But straight they hastened
     Home to the house,
     And all the tale
     To Atli told.

     'Whereas from Gudrun
     Well they hid it,
     Though better by half
     Had she have known it.

    ................

     "Din was there to hear
     Of the hoofs gold-shod,
     When into the garth
     Rode the sons of Giuki.

     "There from Hogni
     The heart they cut,
     But into the worm-close
     Cast the other.
     There the king, the wise-hearted,
     Swept his harp-strings,
     For the might king
     Had ever mind
     That I to his helping
     Soon should come.

     "But now was I gone
     Yet once again
     Unto Geirmund,
     Good feast to make;
     Yet had I hearing,
     E'en out from Hlesey,
     How of sore trouble
     The harp-strings sang.

     "So I bade the bondmaids
     Be ready swiftly,
     For I listed to save
     The life of the king,
     And we let our ship
     Swim over the sound,
     Till Atli's dwelling
     We saw all clearly.

     Then came the wretch (1)
     Crawling out,
     E'en Atli's mother,
     All sorrow upon her!
     A grave gat her sting
     In the heart of Gunnar,
     So that no helping
     Was left for my hero.

     "O gold-clad woman,
     Full oft I wonder
     How I my life
     Still hold thereafter,
     For methought I loved
     That light in battle,
     The swift with the sword,
     As my very self.

     "Thou hast sat and hearkened
     As I have told thee
     Of many an ill-fate,
     Mine and theirs--
     Each man liveth
     E'en as he may live--
     Now hath gone forth
     The greeting of Oddrun."

       lulled to sleep by Gunnar's harp-playing, and who slew him.

BEOWULF




PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE



LO, praise of the prowess of people-kings
of spear-armed Danes, in days long sped,
we have heard, and what honor the athelings won!
Oft Scyld the Scefing from squadroned foes,
from many a tribe, the mead-bench tore,
awing the earls. Since erst he lay
friendless, a foundling, fate repaid him:
for he waxed under welkin, in wealth he throve,
till before him the folk, both far and near,
who house by the whale-path, heard his mandate,
gave him gifts:  a good king he!
To him an heir was afterward born,
a son in his halls, whom heaven sent
to favor the folk, feeling their woe
that erst they had lacked an earl for leader
so long a while; the Lord endowed him,
the Wielder of Wonder, with world's renown.
Famed was this Beowulf:  {0a} far flew the boast of him,
son of Scyld, in the Scandian lands.
So becomes it a youth to quit him well
with his father's friends, by fee and gift,
that to aid him, aged, in after days,
come warriors willing, should war draw nigh,
liegemen loyal:  by lauded deeds
shall an earl have honor in every clan.

Forth he fared at the fated moment,
sturdy Scyld to the shelter of God.
Then they bore him over to ocean's billow,
loving clansmen, as late he charged them,
while wielded words the winsome Scyld,
the leader beloved who long had ruled....
In the roadstead rocked a ring-dight vessel,
ice-flecked, outbound, atheling's barge:
there laid they down their darling lord
on the breast of the boat, the breaker-of-rings, {0b}
by the mast the mighty one. Many a treasure
fetched from far was freighted with him.
No ship have I known so nobly dight
with weapons of war and weeds of battle,
with breastplate and blade:  on his bosom lay
a heaped hoard that hence should go
far o'er the flood with him floating away.
No less these loaded the lordly gifts,
thanes' huge treasure, than those had done
who in former time forth had sent him
sole on the seas, a suckling child.
High o'er his head they hoist the standard,
a gold-wove banner; let billows take him,
gave him to ocean. Grave were their spirits,
mournful their mood. No man is able
to say in sooth, no son of the halls,
no hero 'neath heaven, -- who harbored that freight!



I

Now Beowulf bode in the burg of the Scyldings,
leader beloved, and long he ruled
in fame with all folk, since his father had gone
away from the world, till awoke an heir,
haughty Healfdene, who held through life,
sage and sturdy, the Scyldings glad.
Then, one after one, there woke to him,
to the chieftain of clansmen, children four:
Heorogar, then Hrothgar, then Halga brave;
and I heard that -- was -- 's queen,
the Heathoscylfing's helpmate dear.
To Hrothgar was given such glory of war,
such honor of combat, that all his kin
obeyed him gladly till great grew his band
of youthful comrades. It came in his mind
to bid his henchmen a hall uprear,
a master mead-house, mightier far
than ever was seen by the sons of earth,
and within it, then, to old and young
he would all allot that the Lord had sent him,
save only the land and the lives of his men.
Wide, I heard, was the work commanded,
for many a tribe this mid-earth round,
to fashion the folkstead. It fell, as he ordered,
in rapid achievement that ready it stood there,
of halls the noblest:  Heorot {1a} he named it
whose message had might in many a land.
Not reckless of promise, the rings he dealt,
treasure at banquet:  there towered the hall,
high, gabled wide, the hot surge waiting
of furious flame. {1b} Nor far was that day
when father and son-in-law stood in feud
for warfare and hatred that woke again. {1c}
With envy and anger an evil spirit
endured the dole in his dark abode,
that he heard each day the din of revel
high in the hall:  there harps rang out,
clear song of the singer. He sang who knew {1d}
tales of the early time of man,
how the Almighty made the earth,
fairest fields enfolded by water,
set, triumphant, sun and moon
for a light to lighten the land-dwellers,
and braided bright the breast of earth
with limbs and leaves, made life for all
of mortal beings that breathe and move.
So lived the clansmen in cheer and revel
a winsome life, till one began
to fashion evils, that field of hell.
Grendel this monster grim was called,
march-riever {1e} mighty, in moorland living,
in fen and fastness; fief of the giants
the hapless wight a while had kept
since the Creator his exile doomed.
On kin of Cain was the killing avenged
by sovran God for slaughtered Abel.
Ill fared his feud, {1f} and far was he driven,
for the slaughter's sake, from sight of men.
Of Cain awoke all that woful breed,
Etins {1g} and elves and evil-spirits,
as well as the giants that warred with God
weary while:  but their wage was paid them!



II

WENT he forth to find at fall of night
that haughty house, and heed wherever
the Ring-Danes, outrevelled, to rest had gone.
Found within it the atheling band
asleep after feasting and fearless of sorrow,
of human hardship. Unhallowed wight,
grim and greedy, he grasped betimes,
wrathful, reckless, from resting-places,
thirty of the thanes, and thence he rushed
fain of his fell spoil, faring homeward,
laden with slaughter, his lair to seek.
Then at the dawning, as day was breaking,
the might of Grendel to men was known;
then after wassail was wail uplifted,
loud moan in the morn. The mighty chief,
atheling excellent, unblithe sat,
labored in woe for the loss of his thanes,
when once had been traced the trail of the fiend,
spirit accurst:  too cruel that sorrow,
too long, too loathsome. Not late the respite;
with night returning, anew began
ruthless murder; he recked no whit,
firm in his guilt, of the feud and crime.
They were easy to find who elsewhere sought
in room remote their rest at night,
bed in the bowers, {2a} when that bale was shown,
was seen in sooth, with surest token, --
the hall-thane's {2b} hate. Such held themselves
far and fast who the fiend outran!
Thus ruled unrighteous and raged his fill
one against all; until empty stood
that lordly building, and long it bode so.
Twelve years' tide the trouble he bore,
sovran of Scyldings, sorrows in plenty,
boundless cares. There came unhidden
tidings true to the tribes of men,
in sorrowful songs, how ceaselessly Grendel
harassed Hrothgar, what hate he bore him,
what murder and massacre, many a year,
feud unfading, -- refused consent
to deal with any of Daneland's earls,
make pact of peace, or compound for gold:
still less did the wise men ween to get
great fee for the feud from his fiendish hands.
But the evil one ambushed old and young
death-shadow dark, and dogged them still,
lured, or lurked in the livelong night
of misty moorlands:  men may say not
where the haunts of these Hell-Runes {2c} be.
Such heaping of horrors the hater of men,
lonely roamer, wrought unceasing,
harassings heavy. O'er Heorot he lorded,
gold-bright hall, in gloomy nights;
and ne'er could the prince {2d} approach his throne,
-- 'twas judgment of God, -- or have joy in his hall.
Sore was the sorrow to Scyldings'-friend,
heart-rending misery. Many nobles
sat assembled, and searched out counsel
how it were best for bold-hearted men
against harassing terror to try their hand.
Whiles they vowed in their heathen fanes
altar-offerings, asked with words {2e}
that the slayer-of-souls would succor give them
for the pain of their people. Their practice this,
their heathen hope; 'twas Hell they thought of
in mood of their mind. Almighty they knew not,
Doomsman of Deeds and dreadful Lord,
nor Heaven's-Helmet heeded they ever,
Wielder-of-Wonder. -- Woe for that man
who in harm and hatred hales his soul
to fiery embraces; -- nor favor nor change
awaits he ever. But well for him
that after death-day may draw to his Lord,
and friendship find in the Father's arms!



III

THUS seethed unceasing the son of Healfdene
with the woe of these days; not wisest men
assuaged his sorrow; too sore the anguish,
loathly and long, that lay on his folk,
most baneful of burdens and bales of the night.

This heard in his home Hygelac's thane,
great among Geats, of Grendel's doings.
He was the mightiest man of valor
in that same day of this our life,
stalwart and stately. A stout wave-walker
he bade make ready. Yon battle-king, said he,
far o'er the swan-road he fain would seek,
the noble monarch who needed men!
The prince's journey by prudent folk
was little blamed, though they loved him dear;
they whetted the hero, and hailed good omens.
And now the bold one from bands of Geats
comrades chose, the keenest of warriors
e'er he could find; with fourteen men
the sea-wood {3a} he sought, and, sailor proved,
led them on to the land's confines.
Time had now flown; {3b} afloat was the ship,
boat under bluff. On board they climbed,
warriors ready; waves were churning
sea with sand; the sailors bore
on the breast of the bark their bright array,
their mail and weapons:  the men pushed off,
on its willing way, the well-braced craft.
Then moved o'er the waters by might of the wind
that bark like a bird with breast of foam,
till in season due, on the second day,
the curved prow such course had run
that sailors now could see the land,
sea-cliffs shining, steep high hills,
headlands broad. Their haven was found,
their journey ended. Up then quickly
the Weders' {3c} clansmen climbed ashore,
anchored their sea-wood, with armor clashing
and gear of battle:  God they thanked
or passing in peace o'er the paths of the sea.
Now saw from the cliff a Scylding clansman,
a warden that watched the water-side,
how they bore o'er the gangway glittering shields,
war-gear in readiness; wonder seized him
to know what manner of men they were.
Straight to the strand his steed he rode,
Hrothgar's henchman; with hand of might
he shook his spear, and spake in parley.
"Who are ye, then, ye armed men,
mailed folk, that yon mighty vessel
have urged thus over the ocean ways,
here o'er the waters? A warden I,
sentinel set o'er the sea-march here,
lest any foe to the folk of Danes
with harrying fleet should harm the land.
No aliens ever at ease thus bore them,
linden-wielders:  {3d} yet word-of-leave
clearly ye lack from clansmen here,
my folk's agreement. -- A greater ne'er saw I
of warriors in world than is one of you, --
yon hero in harness! No henchman he
worthied by weapons, if witness his features,
his peerless presence! I pray you, though, tell
your folk and home, lest hence ye fare
suspect to wander your way as spies
in Danish land. Now, dwellers afar,
ocean-travellers, take from me
simple advice:  the sooner the better
I hear of the country whence ye came."



IV

To him the stateliest spake in answer;
the warriors' leader his word-hoard unlocked:  --
"We are by kin of the clan of Geats,
and Hygelac's own hearth-fellows we.
To folk afar was my father known,
noble atheling, Ecgtheow named.
Full of winters, he fared away
aged from earth; he is honored still
through width of the world by wise men all.
To thy lord and liege in loyal mood
we hasten hither, to Healfdene's son,
people-protector:  be pleased to advise us!
To that mighty-one come we on mickle errand,
to the lord of the Danes; nor deem I right
that aught be hidden. We hear -- thou knowest
if sooth it is -- the saying of men,
that amid the Scyldings a scathing monster,
dark ill-doer, in dusky nights
shows terrific his rage unmatched,
hatred and murder. To Hrothgar I
in greatness of soul would succor bring,
so the Wise-and-Brave {4a} may worst his foes, --
if ever the end of ills is fated,
of cruel contest, if cure shall follow,
and the boiling care-waves cooler grow;
else ever afterward anguish-days
he shall suffer in sorrow while stands in place
high on its hill that house unpeered!"
Astride his steed, the strand-ward answered,
clansman unquailing:  "The keen-souled thane
must be skilled to sever and sunder duly
words and works, if he well intends.
I gather, this band is graciously bent
to the Scyldings' master. March, then, bearing
weapons and weeds the way I show you.
I will bid my men your boat meanwhile
to guard for fear lest foemen come, --
your new-tarred ship by shore of ocean
faithfully watching till once again
it waft o'er the waters those well-loved thanes,
-- winding-neck'd wood, -- to Weders' bounds,
heroes such as the hest of fate
shall succor and save from the shock of war."
They bent them to march, -- the boat lay still,
fettered by cable and fast at anchor,
broad-bosomed ship. -- Then shone the boars {4b}
over the cheek-guard; chased with gold,
keen and gleaming, guard it kept
o'er the man of war, as marched along
heroes in haste, till the hall they saw,
broad of gable and bright with gold:
that was the fairest, 'mid folk of earth,
of houses 'neath heaven, where Hrothgar lived,
and the gleam of it lightened o'er lands afar.
The sturdy shieldsman showed that bright
burg-of-the-boldest; bade them go
straightway thither; his steed then turned,
hardy hero, and hailed them thus:  --
"'Tis time that I fare from you. Father Almighty
in grace and mercy guard you well,
safe in your seekings. Seaward I go,
'gainst hostile warriors hold my watch."



V

STONE-BRIGHT the street:  {5a} it showed the way
to the crowd of clansmen. Corselets glistened
hand-forged, hard; on their harness bright
the steel ring sang, as they strode along
in mail of battle, and marched to the hall.
There, weary of ocean, the wall along
they set their bucklers, their broad shields, down,
and bowed them to bench:  the breastplates clanged,
war-gear of men; their weapons stacked,
spears of the seafarers stood together,
gray-tipped ash:  that iron band
was worthily weaponed! -- A warrior proud
asked of the heroes their home and kin.
"Whence, now, bear ye burnished shields,
harness gray and helmets grim,
spears in multitude? Messenger, I,
Hrothgar's herald! Heroes so many
ne'er met I as strangers of mood so strong.
'Tis plain that for prowess, not plunged into exile,
for high-hearted valor, Hrothgar ye seek!"
Him the sturdy-in-war bespake with words,
proud earl of the Weders answer made,
hardy 'neath helmet:  -- "Hygelac's, we,
fellows at board; I am Beowulf named.
I am seeking to say to the son of Healfdene
this mission of mine, to thy master-lord,
the doughty prince, if he deign at all
grace that we greet him, the good one, now."
Wulfgar spake, the Wendles' chieftain,
whose might of mind to many was known,
his courage and counsel:  "The king of Danes,
the Scyldings' friend, I fain will tell,
the Breaker-of-Rings, as the boon thou askest,
the famed prince, of thy faring hither,
and, swiftly after, such answer bring
as the doughty monarch may deign to give."
Hied then in haste to where Hrothgar sat
white-haired and old, his earls about him,
till the stout thane stood at the shoulder there
of the Danish king:  good courtier he!
Wulfgar spake to his winsome lord:  --
"Hither have fared to thee far-come men
o'er the paths of ocean, people of Geatland;
and the stateliest there by his sturdy band
is Beowulf named. This boon they seek,
that they, my master, may with thee
have speech at will:  nor spurn their prayer
to give them hearing, gracious Hrothgar!
In weeds of the warrior worthy they,
methinks, of our liking; their leader most surely,
a hero that hither his henchmen has led."



VI

HROTHGAR answered, helmet of Scyldings:  --
"I knew him of yore in his youthful days;
his aged father was Ecgtheow named,
to whom, at home, gave Hrethel the Geat
his only daughter. Their offspring bold
fares hither to seek the steadfast friend.
And seamen, too, have said me this, --
who carried my gifts to the Geatish court,
thither for thanks, -- he has thirty men's
heft of grasp in the gripe of his hand,
the bold-in-battle. Blessed God
out of his mercy this man hath sent
to Danes of the West, as I ween indeed,
against horror of Grendel. I hope to give
the good youth gold for his gallant thought.
Be thou in haste, and bid them hither,
clan of kinsmen, to come before me;
and add this word, -- they are welcome guests
to folk of the Danes."
[To the door of the hall
Wulfgar went] and the word declared:  --
"To you this message my master sends,
East-Danes' king, that your kin he knows,
hardy heroes, and hails you all
welcome hither o'er waves of the sea!
Ye may wend your way in war-attire,
and under helmets Hrothgar greet;
but let here the battle-shields bide your parley,
and wooden war-shafts wait its end."
Uprose the mighty one, ringed with his men,
brave band of thanes:  some bode without,
battle-gear guarding, as bade the chief.
Then hied that troop where the herald led them,
under Heorot's roof:  [the hero strode,]
hardy 'neath helm, till the hearth he neared.
Beowulf spake, -- his breastplate gleamed,
war-net woven by wit of the smith:  --
"Thou Hrothgar, hail! Hygelac's I,
kinsman and follower. Fame a plenty
have I gained in youth! These Grendel-deeds
I heard in my home-land heralded clear.
Seafarers say how stands this hall,
of buildings best, for your band of thanes
empty and idle, when evening sun
in the harbor of heaven is hidden away.
So my vassals advised me well, --
brave and wise, the best of men, --
O sovran Hrothgar, to seek thee here,
for my nerve and my might they knew full well.
Themselves had seen me from slaughter come
blood-flecked from foes, where five I bound,
and that wild brood worsted. I' the waves I slew
nicors {6a} by night, in need and peril
avenging the Weders, {6b} whose woe they sought, --
crushing the grim ones. Grendel now,
monster cruel, be mine to quell
in single battle! So, from thee,
thou sovran of the Shining-Danes,
Scyldings'-bulwark, a boon I seek, --
and, Friend-of-the-folk, refuse it not,
O Warriors'-shield, now I've wandered far, --
that I alone with my liegemen here,
this hardy band, may Heorot purge!
More I hear, that the monster dire,
in his wanton mood, of weapons recks not;
hence shall I scorn -- so Hygelac stay,
king of my kindred, kind to me! --
brand or buckler to bear in the fight,
gold-colored targe:  but with gripe alone
must I front the fiend and fight for life,
foe against foe. Then faith be his
in the doom of the Lord whom death shall take.
Fain, I ween, if the fight he win,
in this hall of gold my Geatish band
will he fearless eat, -- as oft before, --
my noblest thanes. Nor need'st thou then
to hide my head; {6c} for his shall I be,
dyed in gore, if death must take me;
and my blood-covered body he'll bear as prey,
ruthless devour it, the roamer-lonely,
with my life-blood redden his lair in the fen:
no further for me need'st food prepare!
To Hygelac send, if Hild {6d} should take me,
best of war-weeds, warding my breast,
armor excellent, heirloom of Hrethel
and work of Wayland. {6e} Fares Wyrd {6f} as she must."



VII

HROTHGAR spake, the Scyldings'-helmet:  --
"For fight defensive, Friend my Beowulf,
to succor and save, thou hast sought us here.
Thy father's combat {7a} a feud enkindled
when Heatholaf with hand he slew
among the Wylfings; his Weder kin
for horror of fighting feared to hold him.
Fleeing, he sought our South-Dane folk,
over surge of ocean the Honor-Scyldings,
when first I was ruling the folk of Danes,
wielded, youthful, this widespread realm,
this hoard-hold of heroes. Heorogar was dead,
my elder brother, had breathed his last,
Healfdene's bairn:  he was better than I!
Straightway the feud with fee {7b} I settled,
to the Wylfings sent, o'er watery ridges,
treasures olden:  oaths he {7c} swore me.
Sore is my soul to say to any
of the race of man what ruth for me
in Heorot Grendel with hate hath wrought,
what sudden harryings. Hall-folk fail me,
my warriors wane; for Wyrd hath swept them
into Grendel's grasp. But God is able
this deadly foe from his deeds to turn!
Boasted full oft, as my beer they drank,
earls o'er the ale-cup, armed men,
that they would bide in the beer-hall here,
Grendel's attack with terror of blades.
Then was this mead-house at morning tide
dyed with gore, when the daylight broke,
all the boards of the benches blood-besprinkled,
gory the hall:  I had heroes the less,
doughty dear-ones that death had reft.
-- But sit to the banquet, unbind thy words,
hardy hero, as heart shall prompt thee."

Gathered together, the Geatish men
in the banquet-hall on bench assigned,
sturdy-spirited, sat them down,
hardy-hearted. A henchman attended,
carried the carven cup in hand,
served the clear mead. Oft minstrels sang
blithe in Heorot. Heroes revelled,
no dearth of warriors, Weder and Dane.



VIII

UNFERTH spake, the son of Ecglaf,
who sat at the feet of the Scyldings' lord,
unbound the battle-runes. {8a} -- Beowulf's quest,
sturdy seafarer's, sorely galled him;
ever he envied that other men
should more achieve in middle-earth
of fame under heaven than he himself. --
"Art thou that Beowulf, Breca's rival,
who emulous swam on the open sea,
when for pride the pair of you proved the floods,
and wantonly dared in waters deep
to risk your lives? No living man,
or lief or loath, from your labor dire
could you dissuade, from swimming the main.
Ocean-tides with your arms ye covered,
with strenuous hands the sea-streets measured,
swam o'er the waters. Winter's storm
rolled the rough waves. In realm of sea
a sennight strove ye. In swimming he topped thee,
had more of main! Him at morning-tide
billows bore to the Battling Reamas,
whence he hied to his home so dear
beloved of his liegemen, to land of Brondings,
fastness fair, where his folk he ruled,
town and treasure. In triumph o'er thee
Beanstan's bairn {8b} his boast achieved.
So ween I for thee a worse adventure
-- though in buffet of battle thou brave hast been,
in struggle grim, -- if Grendel's approach
thou darst await through the watch of night!"

Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:  --
"What a deal hast uttered, dear my Unferth,
drunken with beer, of Breca now,
told of his triumph! Truth I claim it,
that I had more of might in the sea
than any man else, more ocean-endurance.
We twain had talked, in time of youth,
and made our boast, -- we were merely boys,
striplings still, -- to stake our lives
far at sea:  and so we performed it.
Naked swords, as we swam along,
we held in hand, with hope to guard us
against the whales. Not a whit from me
could he float afar o'er the flood of waves,
haste o'er the billows; nor him I abandoned.
Together we twain on the tides abode
five nights full till the flood divided us,
churning waves and chillest weather,
darkling night, and the northern wind
ruthless rushed on us:  rough was the surge.
Now the wrath of the sea-fish rose apace;
yet me 'gainst the monsters my mailed coat,
hard and hand-linked, help afforded, --
battle-sark braided my breast to ward,
garnished with gold. There grasped me firm
and haled me to bottom the hated foe,
with grimmest gripe. 'Twas granted me, though,
to pierce the monster with point of sword,
with blade of battle:  huge beast of the sea
was whelmed by the hurly through hand of mine.



IX

ME thus often the evil monsters
thronging threatened. With thrust of my sword,
the darling, I dealt them due return!
Nowise had they bliss from their booty then
to devour their victim, vengeful creatures,
seated to banquet at bottom of sea;
but at break of day, by my brand sore hurt,
on the edge of ocean up they lay,
put to sleep by the sword. And since, by them
on the fathomless sea-ways sailor-folk
are never molested. -- Light from east,
came bright God's beacon; the billows sank,
so that I saw the sea-cliffs high,
windy walls. For Wyrd oft saveth
earl undoomed if he doughty be!
And so it came that I killed with my sword
nine of the nicors. Of night-fought battles
ne'er heard I a harder 'neath heaven's dome,
nor adrift on the deep a more desolate man!
Yet I came unharmed from that hostile clutch,
though spent with swimming. The sea upbore me,
flood of the tide, on Finnish land,
the welling waters. No wise of thee
have I heard men tell such terror of falchions,
bitter battle. Breca ne'er yet,
not one of you pair, in the play of war
such daring deed has done at all
with bloody brand, -- I boast not of it! --
though thou wast the bane {9a} of thy brethren dear,
thy closest kin, whence curse of hell
awaits thee, well as thy wit may serve!
For I say in sooth, thou son of Ecglaf,
never had Grendel these grim deeds wrought,
monster dire, on thy master dear,
in Heorot such havoc, if heart of thine
were as battle-bold as thy boast is loud!
But he has found no feud will happen;
from sword-clash dread of your Danish clan
he vaunts him safe, from the Victor-Scyldings.
He forces pledges, favors none
of the land of Danes, but lustily murders,
fights and feasts, nor feud he dreads
from Spear-Dane men. But speedily now
shall I prove him the prowess and pride of the Geats,
shall bid him battle. Blithe to mead
go he that listeth, when light of dawn
this morrow morning o'er men of earth,
ether-robed sun from the south shall beam!"
Joyous then was the Jewel-giver,
hoar-haired, war-brave; help awaited
the Bright-Danes' prince, from Beowulf hearing,
folk's good shepherd, such firm resolve.
Then was laughter of liegemen loud resounding
with winsome words. Came Wealhtheow forth,
queen of Hrothgar, heedful of courtesy,
gold-decked, greeting the guests in hall;
and the high-born lady handed the cup
first to the East-Danes' heir and warden,
bade him be blithe at the beer-carouse,
the land's beloved one. Lustily took he
banquet and beaker, battle-famed king.

Through the hall then went the Helmings' Lady,
to younger and older everywhere
carried the cup, till come the moment
when the ring-graced queen, the royal-hearted,
to Beowulf bore the beaker of mead.
She greeted the Geats' lord, God she thanked,
in wisdom's words, that her will was granted,
that at last on a hero her hope could lean
for comfort in terrors. The cup he took,
hardy-in-war, from Wealhtheow's hand,
and answer uttered the eager-for-combat.
Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:  --
"This was my thought, when my thanes and I
bent to the ocean and entered our boat,
that I would work the will of your people
fully, or fighting fall in death,
in fiend's gripe fast. I am firm to do
an earl's brave deed, or end the days
of this life of mine in the mead-hall here."
Well these words to the woman seemed,
Beowulf's battle-boast. -- Bright with gold
the stately dame by her spouse sat down.
Again, as erst, began in hall
warriors' wassail and words of power,
the proud-band's revel, till presently
the son of Healfdene hastened to seek
rest for the night; he knew there waited
fight for the fiend in that festal hall,
when the sheen of the sun they saw no more,
and dusk of night sank darkling nigh,
and shadowy shapes came striding on,
wan under welkin. The warriors rose.
Man to man, he made harangue,
Hrothgar to Beowulf, bade him hail,
let him wield the wine hall:  a word he added:  --
"Never to any man erst I trusted,
since I could heave up hand and shield,
this noble Dane-Hall, till now to thee.
Have now and hold this house unpeered;
remember thy glory; thy might declare;
watch for the foe! No wish shall fail thee
if thou bidest the battle with bold-won life."



X

THEN Hrothgar went with his hero-train,
defence-of-Scyldings, forth from hall;
fain would the war-lord Wealhtheow seek,
couch of his queen. The King-of-Glory
against this Grendel a guard had set,
so heroes heard, a hall-defender,
who warded the monarch and watched for the monster.
In truth, the Geats' prince gladly trusted
his mettle, his might, the mercy of God!
Cast off then his corselet of iron,
helmet from head; to his henchman gave, --
choicest of weapons, -- the well-chased sword,
bidding him guard the gear of battle.
Spake then his Vaunt the valiant man,
Beowulf Geat, ere the bed be sought:  --
"Of force in fight no feebler I count me,
in grim war-deeds, than Grendel deems him.
Not with the sword, then, to sleep of death
his life will I give, though it lie in my power.
No skill is his to strike against me,
my shield to hew though he hardy be,
bold in battle; we both, this night,
shall spurn the sword, if he seek me here,
unweaponed, for war. Let wisest God,
sacred Lord, on which side soever
doom decree as he deemeth right."
Reclined then the chieftain, and cheek-pillows held
the head of the earl, while all about him
seamen hardy on hall-beds sank.
None of them thought that thence their steps
to the folk and fastness that fostered them,
to the land they loved, would lead them back!
Full well they wist that on warriors many
battle-death seized, in the banquet-hall,
of Danish clan. But comfort and help,
war-weal weaving, to Weder folk
the Master gave, that, by might of one,
over their enemy all prevailed,
by single strength. In sooth 'tis told
that highest God o'er human kind
hath wielded ever! -- Thro' wan night striding,
came the walker-in-shadow. Warriors slept
whose hest was to guard the gabled hall, --
all save one. 'Twas widely known
that against God's will the ghostly ravager
him {10a} could not hurl to haunts of darkness;
wakeful, ready, with warrior's wrath,
bold he bided the battle's issue.



XI

THEN from the moorland, by misty crags,
with God's wrath laden, Grendel came.
The monster was minded of mankind now
sundry to seize in the stately house.
Under welkin he walked, till the wine-palace there,
gold-hall of men, he gladly discerned,
flashing with fretwork. Not first time, this,
that he the home of Hrothgar sought, --
yet ne'er in his life-day, late or early,
such hardy heroes, such hall-thanes, found!
To the house the warrior walked apace,
parted from peace; {11a} the portal opended,
though with forged bolts fast, when his fists had
struck it,
and baleful he burst in his blatant rage,
the house's mouth. All hastily, then,
o'er fair-paved floor the fiend trod on,
ireful he strode; there streamed from his eyes
fearful flashes, like flame to see.

He spied in hall the hero-band,
kin and clansmen clustered asleep,
hardy liegemen. Then laughed his heart;
for the monster was minded, ere morn should dawn,
savage, to sever the soul of each,
life from body, since lusty banquet
waited his will! But Wyrd forbade him
to seize any more of men on earth
after that evening. Eagerly watched
Hygelac's kinsman his cursed foe,
how he would fare in fell attack.
Not that the monster was minded to pause!
Straightway he seized a sleeping warrior
for the first, and tore him fiercely asunder,
the bone-frame bit, drank blood in streams,
swallowed him piecemeal:  swiftly thus
the lifeless corse was clear devoured,
e'en feet and hands. Then farther he hied;
for the hardy hero with hand he grasped,
felt for the foe with fiendish claw,
for the hero reclining, -- who clutched it boldly,
prompt to answer, propped on his arm.
Soon then saw that shepherd-of-evils
that never he met in this middle-world,
in the ways of earth, another wight
with heavier hand-gripe; at heart he feared,
sorrowed in soul, -- none the sooner escaped!
Fain would he flee, his fastness seek,
the den of devils:  no doings now
such as oft he had done in days of old!
Then bethought him the hardy Hygelac-thane
of his boast at evening:  up he bounded,
grasped firm his foe, whose fingers cracked.
The fiend made off, but the earl close followed.
The monster meant -- if he might at all --
to fling himself free, and far away
fly to the fens, -- knew his fingers' power
in the gripe of the grim one. Gruesome march
to Heorot this monster of harm had made!
Din filled the room; the Danes were bereft,
castle-dwellers and clansmen all,
earls, of their ale. Angry were both
those savage hall-guards:  the house resounded.
Wonder it was the wine-hall firm
in the strain of their struggle stood, to earth
the fair house fell not; too fast it was
within and without by its iron bands
craftily clamped; though there crashed from sill
many a mead-bench -- men have told me --
gay with gold, where the grim foes wrestled.
So well had weened the wisest Scyldings
that not ever at all might any man
that bone-decked, brave house break asunder,
crush by craft, -- unless clasp of fire
in smoke engulfed it. -- Again uprose
din redoubled. Danes of the North
with fear and frenzy were filled, each one,
who from the wall that wailing heard,
God's foe sounding his grisly song,
cry of the conquered, clamorous pain
from captive of hell. Too closely held him
he who of men in might was strongest
in that same day of this our life.



XII

NOT in any wise would the earls'-defence {12a}
suffer that slaughterous stranger to live,
useless deeming his days and years
to men on earth. Now many an earl
of Beowulf brandished blade ancestral,
fain the life of their lord to shield,
their praised prince, if power were theirs;
never they knew, -- as they neared the foe,
hardy-hearted heroes of war,
aiming their swords on every side
the accursed to kill, -- no keenest blade,
no farest of falchions fashioned on earth,
could harm or hurt that hideous fiend!
He was safe, by his spells, from sword of battle,
from edge of iron. Yet his end and parting
on that same day of this our life
woful should be, and his wandering soul
far off flit to the fiends' domain.
Soon he found, who in former days,
harmful in heart and hated of God,
on many a man such murder wrought,
that the frame of his body failed him now.
For him the keen-souled kinsman of Hygelac
held in hand; hateful alive
was each to other. The outlaw dire
took mortal hurt; a mighty wound
showed on his shoulder, and sinews cracked,
and the bone-frame burst. To Beowulf now
the glory was given, and Grendel thence
death-sick his den in the dark moor sought,
noisome abode:  he knew too well
that here was the last of life, an end
of his days on earth. -- To all the Danes
by that bloody battle the boon had come.
From ravage had rescued the roving stranger
Hrothgar's hall; the hardy and wise one
had purged it anew. His night-work pleased him,
his deed and its honor. To Eastern Danes
had the valiant Geat his vaunt made good,
all their sorrow and ills assuaged,
their bale of battle borne so long,
and all the dole they erst endured
pain a-plenty. -- 'Twas proof of this,
when the hardy-in-fight a hand laid down,
arm and shoulder, -- all, indeed,
of Grendel's gripe, -- 'neath the gabled roof.



XIII

MANY at morning, as men have told me,
warriors gathered the gift-hall round,
folk-leaders faring from far and near,
o'er wide-stretched ways, the wonder to view,
trace of the traitor. Not troublous seemed
the enemy's end to any man
who saw by the gait of the graceless foe
how the weary-hearted, away from thence,
baffled in battle and banned, his steps
death-marked dragged to the devils' mere.
Bloody the billows were boiling there,
turbid the tide of tumbling waves
horribly seething, with sword-blood hot,
by that doomed one dyed, who in den of the moor
laid forlorn his life adown,
his heathen soul, and hell received it.
Home then rode the hoary clansmen
from that merry journey, and many a youth,
on horses white, the hardy warriors,
back from the mere. Then Beowulf's glory
eager they echoed, and all averred
that from sea to sea, or south or north,
there was no other in earth's domain,
under vault of heaven, more valiant found,
of warriors none more worthy to rule!
(On their lord beloved they laid no slight,
gracious Hrothgar:  a good king he!)
From time to time, the tried-in-battle
their gray steeds set to gallop amain,
and ran a race when the road seemed fair.
From time to time, a thane of the king,
who had made many vaunts, and was mindful of verses,
stored with sagas and songs of old,
bound word to word in well-knit rime,
welded his lay; this warrior soon
of Beowulf's quest right cleverly sang,
and artfully added an excellent tale,
in well-ranged words, of the warlike deeds
he had heard in saga of Sigemund.
Strange the story:  he said it all, --
the Waelsing's wanderings wide, his struggles,
which never were told to tribes of men,
the feuds and the frauds, save to Fitela only,
when of these doings he deigned to speak,
uncle to nephew; as ever the twain
stood side by side in stress of war,
and multitude of the monster kind
they had felled with their swords. Of Sigemund grew,
when he passed from life, no little praise;
for the doughty-in-combat a dragon killed
that herded the hoard:  {13a} under hoary rock
the atheling dared the deed alone
fearful quest, nor was Fitela there.
Yet so it befell, his falchion pierced
that wondrous worm, -- on the wall it struck,
best blade; the dragon died in its blood.
Thus had the dread-one by daring achieved
over the ring-hoard to rule at will,
himself to pleasure; a sea-boat he loaded,
and bore on its bosom the beaming gold,
son of Waels; the worm was consumed.
He had of all heroes the highest renown
among races of men, this refuge-of-warriors,
for deeds of daring that decked his name
since the hand and heart of Heremod
grew slack in battle. He, swiftly banished
to mingle with monsters at mercy of foes,
to death was betrayed; for torrents of sorrow
had lamed him too long; a load of care
to earls and athelings all he proved.
Oft indeed, in earlier days,
for the warrior's wayfaring wise men mourned,
who had hoped of him help from harm and bale,
and had thought their sovran's son would thrive,
follow his father, his folk protect,
the hoard and the stronghold, heroes' land,
home of Scyldings. -- But here, thanes said,
the kinsman of Hygelac kinder seemed
to all:  the other {13b} was urged to crime!
And afresh to the race, {13c} the fallow roads
by swift steeds measured! The morning sun
was climbing higher. Clansmen hastened
to the high-built hall, those hardy-minded,
the wonder to witness. Warden of treasure,
crowned with glory, the king himself,
with stately band from the bride-bower strode;
and with him the queen and her crowd of maidens
measured the path to the mead-house fair.



XIV

HROTHGAR spake, -- to the hall he went,
stood by the steps, the steep roof saw,
garnished with gold, and Grendel's hand:  --
"For the sight I see to the Sovran Ruler
be speedy thanks! A throng of sorrows
I have borne from Grendel; but God still works
wonder on wonder, the Warden-of-Glory.
It was but now that I never more
for woes that weighed on me waited help
long as I lived, when, laved in blood,
stood sword-gore-stained this stateliest house, --
widespread woe for wise men all,
who had no hope to hinder ever
foes infernal and fiendish sprites
from havoc in hall. This hero now,
by the Wielder's might, a work has done
that not all of us erst could ever do
by wile and wisdom. Lo, well can she say
whoso of women this warrior bore
among sons of men, if still she liveth,
that the God of the ages was good to her
in the birth of her bairn. Now, Beowulf, thee,
of heroes best, I shall heartily love
as mine own, my son; preserve thou ever
this kinship new:  thou shalt never lack
wealth of the world that I wield as mine!
Full oft for less have I largess showered,
my precious hoard, on a punier man,
less stout in struggle. Thyself hast now
fulfilled such deeds, that thy fame shall endure
through all the ages. As ever he did,
well may the Wielder reward thee still!"
Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:  --
"This work of war most willingly
we have fought, this fight, and fearlessly dared
force of the foe. Fain, too, were I
hadst thou but seen himself, what time
the fiend in his trappings tottered to fall!
Swiftly, I thought, in strongest gripe
on his bed of death to bind him down,
that he in the hent of this hand of mine
should breathe his last:  but he broke away.
Him I might not -- the Maker willed not --
hinder from flight, and firm enough hold
the life-destroyer:  too sturdy was he,
the ruthless, in running! For rescue, however,
he left behind him his hand in pledge,
arm and shoulder; nor aught of help
could the cursed one thus procure at all.
None the longer liveth he, loathsome fiend,
sunk in his sins, but sorrow holds him
tightly grasped in gripe of anguish,
in baleful bonds, where bide he must,
evil outlaw, such awful doom
as the Mighty Maker shall mete him out."

More silent seemed the son of Ecglaf {14a}
in boastful speech of his battle-deeds,
since athelings all, through the earl's great prowess,
beheld that hand, on the high roof gazing,
foeman's fingers, -- the forepart of each
of the sturdy nails to steel was likest, --
heathen's "hand-spear," hostile warrior's
claw uncanny. 'Twas clear, they said,
that him no blade of the brave could touch,
how keen soever, or cut away
that battle-hand bloody from baneful foe.



XV

THERE was hurry and hest in Heorot now
for hands to bedeck it, and dense was the throng
of men and women the wine-hall to cleanse,
the guest-room to garnish. Gold-gay shone the hangings
that were wove on the wall, and wonders many
to delight each mortal that looks upon them.
Though braced within by iron bands,
that building bright was broken sorely; {15a}
rent were its hinges; the roof alone
held safe and sound, when, seared with crime,
the fiendish foe his flight essayed,
of life despairing. -- No light thing that,
the flight for safety, -- essay it who will!
Forced of fate, he shall find his way
to the refuge ready for race of man,
for soul-possessors, and sons of earth;
and there his body on bed of death
shall rest after revel.
Arrived was the hour
when to hall proceeded Healfdene's son:
the king himself would sit to banquet.
Ne'er heard I of host in haughtier throng
more graciously gathered round giver-of-rings!
Bowed then to bench those bearers-of-glory,
fain of the feasting. Featly received
many a mead-cup the mighty-in-spirit,
kinsmen who sat in the sumptuous hall,
Hrothgar and Hrothulf. Heorot now
was filled with friends; the folk of Scyldings
ne'er yet had tried the traitor's deed.
To Beowulf gave the bairn of Healfdene
a gold-wove banner, guerdon of triumph,
broidered battle-flag, breastplate and helmet;
and a splendid sword was seen of many
borne to the brave one. Beowulf took
cup in hall:  {15b} for such costly gifts
he suffered no shame in that soldier throng.
For I heard of few heroes, in heartier mood,
with four such gifts, so fashioned with gold,
on the ale-bench honoring others thus!
O'er the roof of the helmet high, a ridge,
wound with wires, kept ward o'er the head,
lest the relict-of-files {15c} should fierce invade,
sharp in the strife, when that shielded hero
should go to grapple against his foes.
Then the earls'-defence {15d} on the floor {15e} bade lead
coursers eight, with carven head-gear,
adown the hall:  one horse was decked
with a saddle all shining and set in jewels;
'twas the battle-seat of the best of kings,
when to play of swords the son of Healfdene
was fain to fare. Ne'er failed his valor
in the crush of combat when corpses fell.
To Beowulf over them both then gave
the refuge-of-Ingwines right and power,
o'er war-steeds and weapons:  wished him joy of them.
Manfully thus the mighty prince,
hoard-guard for heroes, that hard fight repaid
with steeds and treasures contemned by none
who is willing to say the sooth aright.

AND the lord of earls, to each that came
with Beowulf over the briny ways,
an heirloom there at the ale-bench gave,
precious gift; and the price {16a} bade pay
in gold for him whom Grendel erst
murdered, -- and fain of them more had killed,
had not wisest God their Wyrd averted,
and the man's {16b} brave mood. The Maker then
ruled human kind, as here and now.
Therefore is insight always best,
and forethought of mind. How much awaits him
of lief and of loath, who long time here,
through days of warfare this world endures!

Then song and music mingled sounds
in the presence of Healfdene's head-of-armies {16c}
and harping was heard with the hero-lay
as Hrothgar's singer the hall-joy woke
along the mead-seats, making his song
of that sudden raid on the sons of Finn. {16d}
Healfdene's hero, Hnaef the Scylding,
was fated to fall in the Frisian slaughter. {16e}
Hildeburh needed not hold in value
her enemies' honor! {16f} Innocent both
were the loved ones she lost at the linden-play,
bairn and brother, they bowed to fate,
stricken by spears; 'twas a sorrowful woman!
None doubted why the daughter of Hoc
bewailed her doom when dawning came,
and under the sky she saw them lying,
kinsmen murdered, where most she had kenned
of the sweets of the world! By war were swept, too,
Finn's own liegemen, and few were left;
in the parleying-place {16g} he could ply no longer
weapon, nor war could he wage on Hengest,
and rescue his remnant by right of arms
from the prince's thane. A pact he offered:
another dwelling the Danes should have,
hall and high-seat, and half the power
should fall to them in Frisian land;
and at the fee-gifts, Folcwald's son
day by day the Danes should honor,
the folk of Hengest favor with rings,
even as truly, with treasure and jewels,
with fretted gold, as his Frisian kin
he meant to honor in ale-hall there.
Pact of peace they plighted further
on both sides firmly. Finn to Hengest
with oath, upon honor, openly promised
that woful remnant, with wise-men's aid,
nobly to govern, so none of the guests
by word or work should warp the treaty, {16h}
or with malice of mind bemoan themselves
as forced to follow their fee-giver's slayer,
lordless men, as their lot ordained.
Should Frisian, moreover, with foeman's taunt,
that murderous hatred to mind recall,
then edge of the sword must seal his doom.

Oaths were given, and ancient gold
heaped from hoard. -- The hardy Scylding,
battle-thane best, {16i} on his balefire lay.
All on the pyre were plain to see
the gory sark, the gilded swine-crest,
boar of hard iron, and athelings many
slain by the sword:  at the slaughter they fell.
It was Hildeburh's hest, at Hnaef's own pyre
the bairn of her body on brands to lay,
his bones to burn, on the balefire placed,
at his uncle's side. In sorrowful dirges
bewept them the woman:  great wailing ascended.
Then wound up to welkin the wildest of death-fires,
roared o'er the hillock:  {16j} heads all were melted,
gashes burst, and blood gushed out
from bites {16k} of the body. Balefire devoured,
greediest spirit, those spared not by war
out of either folk:  their flower was gone.



XVII

THEN hastened those heroes their home to see,
friendless, to find the Frisian land,
houses and high burg. Hengest still
through the death-dyed winter dwelt with Finn,
holding pact, yet of home he minded,
though powerless his ring-decked prow to drive
over the waters, now waves rolled fierce
lashed by the winds, or winter locked them
in icy fetters. Then fared another
year to men's dwellings, as yet they do,
the sunbright skies, that their season ever
duly await. Far off winter was driven;
fair lay earth's breast; and fain was the rover,
the guest, to depart, though more gladly he pondered
on wreaking his vengeance than roaming the deep,
and how to hasten the hot encounter
where sons of the Frisians were sure to be.
So he escaped not the common doom,
when Hun with "Lafing," the light-of-battle,
best of blades, his bosom pierced:
its edge was famed with the Frisian earls.
On fierce-heart Finn there fell likewise,
on himself at home, the horrid sword-death;
for Guthlaf and Oslaf of grim attack
had sorrowing told, from sea-ways landed,
mourning their woes. {17a} Finn's wavering spirit
bode not in breast. The burg was reddened
with blood of foemen, and Finn was slain,
king amid clansmen; the queen was taken.
To their ship the Scylding warriors bore
all the chattels the chieftain owned,
whatever they found in Finn's domain
of gems and jewels. The gentle wife
o'er paths of the deep to the Danes they bore,
led to her land.
The lay was finished,
the gleeman's song. Then glad rose the revel;
bench-joy brightened. Bearers draw
from their "wonder-vats" wine. Comes Wealhtheow forth,
under gold-crown goes where the good pair sit,
uncle and nephew, true each to the other one,
kindred in amity. Unferth the spokesman
at the Scylding lord's feet sat:  men had faith in his spirit,
his keenness of courage, though kinsmen had found him
unsure at the sword-play. The Scylding queen spoke:
"Quaff of this cup, my king and lord,
breaker of rings, and blithe be thou,
gold-friend of men; to the Geats here speak
such words of mildness as man should use.
Be glad with thy Geats; of those gifts be mindful,
or near or far, which now thou hast.

Men say to me, as son thou wishest
yon hero to hold. Thy Heorot purged,
jewel-hall brightest, enjoy while thou canst,
with many a largess; and leave to thy kin
folk and realm when forth thou goest
to greet thy doom. For gracious I deem
my Hrothulf, {17b} willing to hold and rule
nobly our youths, if thou yield up first,
prince of Scyldings, thy part in the world.
I ween with good he will well requite
offspring of ours, when all he minds
that for him we did in his helpless days
of gift and grace to gain him honor!"
Then she turned to the seat where her sons wereplaced,
Hrethric and Hrothmund, with heroes' bairns,
young men together:  the Geat, too, sat there,
Beowulf brave, the brothers between.



XVIII

A CUP she gave him, with kindly greeting
and winsome words. Of wounden gold,
she offered, to honor him, arm-jewels twain,
corselet and rings, and of collars the noblest
that ever I knew the earth around.
Ne'er heard I so mighty, 'neath heaven's dome,
a hoard-gem of heroes, since Hama bore
to his bright-built burg the Brisings' necklace,
jewel and gem casket. -- Jealousy fled he,
Eormenric's hate:  chose help eternal.
Hygelac Geat, grandson of Swerting,
on the last of his raids this ring bore with him,
under his banner the booty defending,
the war-spoil warding; but Wyrd o'erwhelmed him
what time, in his daring, dangers he sought,
feud with Frisians. Fairest of gems
he bore with him over the beaker-of-waves,
sovran strong:  under shield he died.
Fell the corpse of the king into keeping of Franks,
gear of the breast, and that gorgeous ring;
weaker warriors won the spoil,
after gripe of battle, from Geatland's lord,
and held the death-field.
Din rose in hall.
Wealhtheow spake amid warriors, and said:  --
"This jewel enjoy in thy jocund youth,
Beowulf lov'd, these battle-weeds wear,
a royal treasure, and richly thrive!
Preserve thy strength, and these striplings here
counsel in kindness:  requital be mine.
Hast done such deeds, that for days to come
thou art famed among folk both far and near,
so wide as washeth the wave of Ocean
his windy walls. Through the ways of life
prosper, O prince! I pray for thee
rich possessions. To son of mine
be helpful in deed and uphold his joys!
Here every earl to the other is true,
mild of mood, to the master loyal!
Thanes are friendly, the throng obedient,
liegemen are revelling:  list and obey!"
Went then to her place. -- That was proudest of feasts;
flowed wine for the warriors. Wyrd they knew not,
destiny dire, and the doom to be seen
by many an earl when eve should come,
and Hrothgar homeward hasten away,
royal, to rest. The room was guarded
by an army of earls, as erst was done.
They bared the bench-boards; abroad they spread
beds and bolsters. -- One beer-carouser
in danger of doom lay down in the hall. --

At their heads they set their shields of war,
bucklers bright; on the bench were there
over each atheling, easy to see,
the high battle-helmet, the haughty spear,
the corselet of rings. 'Twas their custom so
ever to be for battle prepared,
at home, or harrying, which it were,
even as oft as evil threatened
their sovran king. -- They were clansmen good.



XIX

THEN sank they to sleep. With sorrow one bought
his rest of the evening, -- as ofttime had happened
when Grendel guarded that golden hall,
evil wrought, till his end drew nigh,
slaughter for sins. 'Twas seen and told
how an avenger survived the fiend,
as was learned afar. The livelong time
after that grim fight, Grendel's mother,
monster of women, mourned her woe.
She was doomed to dwell in the dreary waters,
cold sea-courses, since Cain cut down
with edge of the sword his only brother,
his father's offspring:  outlawed he fled,
marked with murder, from men's delights
warded the wilds. -- There woke from him
such fate-sent ghosts as Grendel, who,
war-wolf horrid, at Heorot found
a warrior watching and waiting the fray,
with whom the grisly one grappled amain.
But the man remembered his mighty power,
the glorious gift that God had sent him,
in his Maker's mercy put his trust
for comfort and help:  so he conquered the foe,
felled the fiend, who fled abject,
reft of joy, to the realms of death,
mankind's foe. And his mother now,
gloomy and grim, would go that quest
of sorrow, the death of her son to avenge.
To Heorot came she, where helmeted Danes
slept in the hall. Too soon came back
old ills of the earls, when in she burst,
the mother of Grendel. Less grim, though, that terror,
e'en as terror of woman in war is less,
might of maid, than of men in arms
when, hammer-forged, the falchion hard,
sword gore-stained, through swine of the helm,
crested, with keen blade carves amain.
Then was in hall the hard-edge drawn,
the swords on the settles, {19a} and shields a-many
firm held in hand:  nor helmet minded
nor harness of mail, whom that horror seized.
Haste was hers; she would hie afar
and save her life when the liegemen saw her.
Yet a single atheling up she seized
fast and firm, as she fled to the moor.
He was for Hrothgar of heroes the dearest,
of trusty vassals betwixt the seas,
whom she killed on his couch, a clansman famous,
in battle brave. -- Nor was Beowulf there;
another house had been held apart,
after giving of gold, for the Geat renowned. --
Uproar filled Heorot; the hand all had viewed,
blood-flecked, she bore with her; bale was returned,
dole in the dwellings:  'twas dire exchange
where Dane and Geat were doomed to give
the lives of loved ones. Long-tried king,
the hoary hero, at heart was sad
when he knew his noble no more lived,
and dead indeed was his dearest thane.
To his bower was Beowulf brought in haste,
dauntless victor. As daylight broke,
along with his earls the atheling lord,
with his clansmen, came where the king abode
waiting to see if the Wielder-of-All
would turn this tale of trouble and woe.
Strode o'er floor the famed-in-strife,
with his hand-companions, -- the hall resounded, --
wishing to greet the wise old king,
Ingwines' lord; he asked if the night
had passed in peace to the prince's mind.



XX

HROTHGAR spake, helmet-of-Scyldings:  --
"Ask not of pleasure! Pain is renewed
to Danish folk. Dead is Aeschere,
of Yrmenlaf the elder brother,
my sage adviser and stay in council,
shoulder-comrade in stress of fight
when warriors clashed and we warded our heads,
hewed the helm-boars; hero famed
should be every earl as Aeschere was!
But here in Heorot a hand hath slain him
of wandering death-sprite. I wot not whither, {20a}
proud of the prey, her path she took,
fain of her fill. The feud she avenged
that yesternight, unyieldingly,
Grendel in grimmest grasp thou killedst, --
seeing how long these liegemen mine
he ruined and ravaged. Reft of life,
in arms he fell. Now another comes,
keen and cruel, her kin to avenge,
faring far in feud of blood:
so that many a thane shall think, who e'er
sorrows in soul for that sharer of rings,
this is hardest of heart-bales. The hand lies low
that once was willing each wish to please.
Land-dwellers here {20b} and liegemen mine,
who house by those parts, I have heard relate
that such a pair they have sometimes seen,
march-stalkers mighty the moorland haunting,
wandering spirits:  one of them seemed,
so far as my folk could fairly judge,
of womankind; and one, accursed,
in man's guise trod the misery-track
of exile, though huger than human bulk.
Grendel in days long gone they named him,
folk of the land; his father they knew not,
nor any brood that was born to him
of treacherous spirits. Untrod is their home;
by wolf-cliffs haunt they and windy headlands,
fenways fearful, where flows the stream
from mountains gliding to gloom of the rocks,
underground flood. Not far is it hence
in measure of miles that the mere expands,
and o'er it the frost-bound forest hanging,
sturdily rooted, shadows the wave.
By night is a wonder weird to see,
fire on the waters. So wise lived none
of the sons of men, to search those depths!
Nay, though the heath-rover, harried by dogs,
the horn-proud hart, this holt should seek,
long distance driven, his dear life first
on the brink he yields ere he brave the plunge
to hide his head:  'tis no happy place!
Thence the welter of waters washes up
wan to welkin when winds bestir
evil storms, and air grows dusk,
and the heavens weep. Now is help once more
with thee alone! The land thou knowst not,
place of fear, where thou findest out
that sin-flecked being. Seek if thou dare!
I will reward thee, for waging this fight,
with ancient treasure, as erst I did,
with winding gold, if thou winnest back."



XXI

BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:
"Sorrow not, sage! It beseems us better
friends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them.
Each of us all must his end abide
in the ways of the world; so win who may
glory ere death! When his days are told,
that is the warrior's worthiest doom.
Rise, O realm-warder! Ride we anon,
and mark the trail of the mother of Grendel.
No harbor shall hide her -- heed my promise! --
enfolding of field or forested mountain
or floor of the flood, let her flee where she will!
But thou this day endure in patience,
as I ween thou wilt, thy woes each one."
Leaped up the graybeard:  God he thanked,
mighty Lord, for the man's brave words.
For Hrothgar soon a horse was saddled
wave-maned steed. The sovran wise
stately rode on; his shield-armed men
followed in force. The footprints led
along the woodland, widely seen,
a path o'er the plain, where she passed, and trod
the murky moor; of men-at-arms
she bore the bravest and best one, dead,
him who with Hrothgar the homestead ruled.
On then went the atheling-born
o'er stone-cliffs steep and strait defiles,
narrow passes and unknown ways,
headlands sheer, and the haunts of the Nicors.
Foremost he {21a} fared, a few at his side
of the wiser men, the ways to scan,
till he found in a flash the forested hill
hanging over the hoary rock,
a woful wood:  the waves below
were dyed in blood. The Danish men
had sorrow of soul, and for Scyldings all,
for many a hero, 'twas hard to bear,
ill for earls, when Aeschere's head
they found by the flood on the foreland there.
Waves were welling, the warriors saw,
hot with blood; but the horn sang oft
battle-song bold. The band sat down,
and watched on the water worm-like things,
sea-dragons strange that sounded the deep,
and nicors that lay on the ledge of the ness --
such as oft essay at hour of morn
on the road-of-sails their ruthless quest, --
and sea-snakes and monsters. These started away,
swollen and savage that song to hear,
that war-horn's blast. The warden of Geats,
with bolt from bow, then balked of life,
of wave-work, one monster, amid its heart
went the keen war-shaft; in water it seemed
less doughty in swimming whom death had seized.
Swift on the billows, with boar-spears well
hooked and barbed, it was hard beset,
done to death and dragged on the headland,
wave-roamer wondrous. Warriors viewed
the grisly guest.
Then girt him Beowulf
in martial mail, nor mourned for his life.
His breastplate broad and bright of hues,
woven by hand, should the waters try;
well could it ward the warrior's body
that battle should break on his breast in vain
nor harm his heart by the hand of a foe.
And the helmet white that his head protected
was destined to dare the deeps of the flood,
through wave-whirl win:  'twas wound with chains,
decked with gold, as in days of yore
the weapon-smith worked it wondrously,
with swine-forms set it, that swords nowise,
brandished in battle, could bite that helm.
Nor was that the meanest of mighty helps
which Hrothgar's orator offered at need:
"Hrunting" they named the hilted sword,
of old-time heirlooms easily first;
iron was its edge, all etched with poison,
with battle-blood hardened, nor blenched it at fight
in hero's hand who held it ever,
on paths of peril prepared to go
to folkstead {21b} of foes. Not first time this
it was destined to do a daring task.
For he bore not in mind, the bairn of Ecglaf
sturdy and strong, that speech he had made,
drunk with wine, now this weapon he lent
to a stouter swordsman. Himself, though, durst not
under welter of waters wager his life
as loyal liegeman. So lost he his glory,
honor of earls. With the other not so,
who girded him now for the grim encounter.



XXII

BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:  --
"Have mind, thou honored offspring of Healfdene
gold-friend of men, now I go on this quest,
sovran wise, what once was said:
if in thy cause it came that I
should lose my life, thou wouldst loyal bide
to me, though fallen, in father's place!
Be guardian, thou, to this group of my thanes,
my warrior-friends, if War should seize me;
and the goodly gifts thou gavest me,
Hrothgar beloved, to Hygelac send!
Geatland's king may ken by the gold,
Hrethel's son see, when he stares at the treasure,
that I got me a friend for goodness famed,
and joyed while I could in my jewel-bestower.
And let Unferth wield this wondrous sword,
earl far-honored, this heirloom precious,
hard of edge:  with Hrunting I
seek doom of glory, or Death shall take me."

After these words the Weder-Geat lord
boldly hastened, biding never
answer at all:  the ocean floods
closed o'er the hero. Long while of the day
fled ere he felt the floor of the sea.

Soon found the fiend who the flood-domain
sword-hungry held these hundred winters,
greedy and grim, that some guest from above,
some man, was raiding her monster-realm.
She grasped out for him with grisly claws,
and the warrior seized; yet scathed she not
his body hale; the breastplate hindered,
as she strove to shatter the sark of war,
the linked harness, with loathsome hand.
Then bore this brine-wolf, when bottom she touched,
the lord of rings to the lair she haunted
whiles vainly he strove, though his valor held,
weapon to wield against wondrous monsters
that sore beset him; sea-beasts many
tried with fierce tusks to tear his mail,
and swarmed on the stranger. But soon he marked
he was now in some hall, he knew not which,
where water never could work him harm,
nor through the roof could reach him ever
fangs of the flood. Firelight he saw,
beams of a blaze that brightly shone.
Then the warrior was ware of that wolf-of-the-deep,
mere-wife monstrous. For mighty stroke
he swung his blade, and the blow withheld not.
Then sang on her head that seemly blade
its war-song wild. But the warrior found
the light-of-battle {22a} was loath to bite,
to harm the heart:  its hard edge failed
the noble at need, yet had known of old
strife hand to hand, and had helmets cloven,
doomed men's fighting-gear. First time, this,
for the gleaming blade that its glory fell.
Firm still stood, nor failed in valor,
heedful of high deeds, Hygelac's kinsman;
flung away fretted sword, featly jewelled,
the angry earl; on earth it lay
steel-edged and stiff. His strength he trusted,
hand-gripe of might. So man shall do
whenever in war he weens to earn him
lasting fame, nor fears for his life!
Seized then by shoulder, shrank not from combat,
the Geatish war-prince Grendel's mother.
Flung then the fierce one, filled with wrath,
his deadly foe, that she fell to ground.
Swift on her part she paid him back
with grisly grasp, and grappled with him.
Spent with struggle, stumbled the warrior,
fiercest of fighting-men, fell adown.
On the hall-guest she hurled herself, hent her short sword,
broad and brown-edged, {22b} the bairn to avenge,
the sole-born son. -- On his shoulder lay
braided breast-mail, barring death,
withstanding entrance of edge or blade.
Life would have ended for Ecgtheow's son,
under wide earth for that earl of Geats,
had his armor of war not aided him,
battle-net hard, and holy God
wielded the victory, wisest Maker.
The Lord of Heaven allowed his cause;
and easily rose the earl erect.




XXIII

'MID the battle-gear saw he a blade triumphant,
old-sword of Eotens, with edge of proof,
warriors' heirloom, weapon unmatched,
-- save only 'twas more than other men
to bandy-of-battle could bear at all --
as the giants had wrought it, ready and keen.
Seized then its chain-hilt the Scyldings' chieftain,
bold and battle-grim, brandished the sword,
reckless of life, and so wrathfully smote
that it gripped her neck and grasped her hard,
her bone-rings breaking:  the blade pierced through
that fated-one's flesh:  to floor she sank.
Bloody the blade:  he was blithe of his deed.
Then blazed forth light. 'Twas bright within
as when from the sky there shines unclouded
heaven's candle. The hall he scanned.
By the wall then went he; his weapon raised
high by its hilts the Hygelac-thane,
angry and eager. That edge was not useless
to the warrior now. He wished with speed
Grendel to guerdon for grim raids many,
for the war he waged on Western-Danes
oftener far than an only time,
when of Hrothgar's hearth-companions
he slew in slumber, in sleep devoured,
fifteen men of the folk of Danes,
and as many others outward bore,
his horrible prey. Well paid for that
the wrathful prince! For now prone he saw
Grendel stretched there, spent with war,
spoiled of life, so scathed had left him
Heorot's battle. The body sprang far
when after death it endured the blow,
sword-stroke savage, that severed its head.
Soon, {23a} then, saw the sage companions
who waited with Hrothgar, watching the flood,
that the tossing waters turbid grew,
blood-stained the mere. Old men together,
hoary-haired, of the hero spake;
the warrior would not, they weened, again,
proud of conquest, come to seek
their mighty master. To many it seemed
the wolf-of-the-waves had won his life.
The ninth hour came. The noble Scyldings
left the headland; homeward went
the gold-friend of men. {23b} But the guests sat on,
stared at the surges, sick in heart,
and wished, yet weened not, their winsome lord
again to see.

Now that sword began,
from blood of the fight, in battle-droppings, {23c}
war-blade, to wane:  'twas a wondrous thing
that all of it melted as ice is wont
when frosty fetters the Father loosens,
unwinds the wave-bonds, wielding all
seasons and times:  the true God he!
Nor took from that dwelling the duke of the Geats
save only the head and that hilt withal
blazoned with jewels:  the blade had melted,
burned was the bright sword, her blood was so hot,
so poisoned the hell-sprite who perished within there.
Soon he was swimming who safe saw in combat
downfall of demons; up-dove through the flood.
The clashing waters were cleansed now,
waste of waves, where the wandering fiend
her life-days left and this lapsing world.
Swam then to strand the sailors'-refuge,
sturdy-in-spirit, of sea-booty glad,
of burden brave he bore with him.
Went then to greet him, and God they thanked,
the thane-band choice of their chieftain blithe,
that safe and sound they could see him again.
Soon from the hardy one helmet and armor
deftly they doffed:  now drowsed the mere,
water 'neath welkin, with war-blood stained.
Forth they fared by the footpaths thence,
merry at heart the highways measured,
well-known roads. Courageous men
carried the head from the cliff by the sea,
an arduous task for all the band,
the firm in fight, since four were needed
on the shaft-of-slaughter {23d} strenuously
to bear to the gold-hall Grendel's head.
So presently to the palace there
foemen fearless, fourteen Geats,
marching came. Their master-of-clan
mighty amid them the meadow-ways trod.
Strode then within the sovran thane
fearless in fight, of fame renowned,
hardy hero, Hrothgar to greet.
And next by the hair into hall was borne
Grendel's head, where the henchmen were drinking,
an awe to clan and queen alike,
a monster of marvel:  the men looked on.



XXIV

BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:  --
"Lo, now, this sea-booty, son of Healfdene,
Lord of Scyldings, we've lustily brought thee,
sign of glory; thou seest it here.
Not lightly did I with my life escape!
In war under water this work I essayed
with endless effort; and even so
my strength had been lost had the Lord not shielded me.
Not a whit could I with Hrunting do
in work of war, though the weapon is good;
yet a sword the Sovran of Men vouchsafed me
to spy on the wall there, in splendor hanging,
old, gigantic, -- how oft He guides
the friendless wight! -- and I fought with that brand,
felling in fight, since fate was with me,
the house's wardens. That war-sword then
all burned, bright blade, when the blood gushed o'er it,
battle-sweat hot; but the hilt I brought back
from my foes. So avenged I their fiendish deeds
death-fall of Danes, as was due and right.
And this is my hest, that in Heorot now
safe thou canst sleep with thy soldier band,
and every thane of all thy folk
both old and young; no evil fear,
Scyldings' lord, from that side again,
aught ill for thy earls, as erst thou must!"
Then the golden hilt, for that gray-haired leader,
hoary hero, in hand was laid,
giant-wrought, old. So owned and enjoyed it
after downfall of devils, the Danish lord,
wonder-smiths' work, since the world was rid
of that grim-souled fiend, the foe of God,
murder-marked, and his mother as well.
Now it passed into power of the people's king,
best of all that the oceans bound
who have scattered their gold o'er Scandia's isle.
Hrothgar spake -- the hilt he viewed,
heirloom old, where was etched the rise
of that far-off fight when the floods o'erwhelmed,
raging waves, the race of giants
(fearful their fate!), a folk estranged
from God Eternal:  whence guerdon due
in that waste of waters the Wielder paid them.
So on the guard of shining gold
in runic staves it was rightly said
for whom the serpent-traced sword was wrought,
best of blades, in bygone days,
and the hilt well wound. -- The wise-one spake,
son of Healfdene; silent were all:  --
"Lo, so may he say who sooth and right
follows 'mid folk, of far times mindful,
a land-warden old, {24a} that this earl belongs
to the better breed! So, borne aloft,
thy fame must fly, O friend my Beowulf,
far and wide o'er folksteads many. Firmly thou
shalt all maintain,
mighty strength with mood of wisdom. Love of
mine will I assure thee,
as, awhile ago, I promised; thou shalt prove a stay
in future,
in far-off years, to folk of thine,
to the heroes a help. Was not Heremod thus
to offspring of Ecgwela, Honor-Scyldings,
nor grew for their grace, but for grisly slaughter,
for doom of death to the Danishmen.

He slew, wrath-swollen, his shoulder-comrades,
companions at board! So he passed alone,
chieftain haughty, from human cheer.
Though him the Maker with might endowed,
delights of power, and uplifted high
above all men, yet blood-fierce his mind,
his breast-hoard, grew, no bracelets gave he
to Danes as was due; he endured all joyless
strain of struggle and stress of woe,
long feud with his folk. Here find thy lesson!
Of virtue advise thee! This verse I have said for thee,
wise from lapsed winters. Wondrous seems
how to sons of men Almighty God
in the strength of His spirit sendeth wisdom,
estate, high station:  He swayeth all things.
Whiles He letteth right lustily fare
the heart of the hero of high-born race, --
in seat ancestral assigns him bliss,
his folk's sure fortress in fee to hold,
puts in his power great parts of the earth,
empire so ample, that end of it
this wanter-of-wisdom weeneth none.
So he waxes in wealth, nowise can harm him
illness or age; no evil cares
shadow his spirit; no sword-hate threatens
from ever an enemy:  all the world
wends at his will, no worse he knoweth,
till all within him obstinate pride
waxes and wakes while the warden slumbers,
the spirit's sentry; sleep is too fast
which masters his might, and the murderer nears,
stealthily shooting the shafts from his bow!



XXV

"UNDER harness his heart then is hit indeed
by sharpest shafts; and no shelter avails
from foul behest of the hellish fiend. {25a}
Him seems too little what long he possessed.
Greedy and grim, no golden rings
he gives for his pride; the promised future
forgets he and spurns, with all God has sent him,
Wonder-Wielder, of wealth and fame.
Yet in the end it ever comes
that the frame of the body fragile yields,
fated falls; and there follows another
who joyously the jewels divides,
the royal riches, nor recks of his forebear.
Ban, then, such baleful thoughts, Beowulf dearest,
best of men, and the better part choose,
profit eternal; and temper thy pride,
warrior famous! The flower of thy might
lasts now a while:  but erelong it shall be
that sickness or sword thy strength shall minish,
or fang of fire, or flooding billow,
or bite of blade, or brandished spear,
or odious age; or the eyes' clear beam
wax dull and darken:  Death even thee
in haste shall o'erwhelm, thou hero of war!
So the Ring-Danes these half-years a hundred I ruled,
wielded 'neath welkin, and warded them bravely
from mighty-ones many o'er middle-earth,
from spear and sword, till it seemed for me
no foe could be found under fold of the sky.
Lo, sudden the shift! To me seated secure
came grief for joy when Grendel began
to harry my home, the hellish foe;
for those ruthless raids, unresting I suffered
heart-sorrow heavy. Heaven be thanked,
Lord Eternal, for life extended
that I on this head all hewn and bloody,
after long evil, with eyes may gaze!
-- Go to the bench now! Be glad at banquet,
warrior worthy! A wealth of treasure
at dawn of day, be dealt between us!"
Glad was the Geats' lord, going betimes
to seek his seat, as the Sage commanded.
Afresh, as before, for the famed-in-battle,
for the band of the hall, was a banquet dight
nobly anew. The Night-Helm darkened
dusk o'er the drinkers.
The doughty ones rose:
for the hoary-headed would hasten to rest,
aged Scylding; and eager the Geat,
shield-fighter sturdy, for sleeping yearned.
Him wander-weary, warrior-guest
from far, a hall-thane heralded forth,
who by custom courtly cared for all
needs of a thane as in those old days
warrior-wanderers wont to have.
So slumbered the stout-heart. Stately the hall
rose gabled and gilt where the guest slept on
till a raven black the rapture-of-heaven {25b}
blithe-heart boded. Bright came flying
shine after shadow. The swordsmen hastened,
athelings all were eager homeward
forth to fare; and far from thence
the great-hearted guest would guide his keel.
Bade then the hardy-one Hrunting be brought
to the son of Ecglaf, the sword bade him take,
excellent iron, and uttered his thanks for it,
quoth that he counted it keen in battle,
"war-friend" winsome:  with words he slandered not
edge of the blade:  'twas a big-hearted man!
Now eager for parting and armed at point
warriors waited, while went to his host
that Darling of Danes. The doughty atheling
to high-seat hastened and Hrothgar greeted.



XXVI

BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:  --
"Lo, we seafarers say our will,
far-come men, that we fain would seek
Hygelac now. We here have found
hosts to our heart:  thou hast harbored us well.
If ever on earth I am able to win me
more of thy love, O lord of men,
aught anew, than I now have done,
for work of war I am willing still!
If it come to me ever across the seas
that neighbor foemen annoy and fright thee, --
as they that hate thee erewhile have used, --
thousands then of thanes I shall bring,
heroes to help thee. Of Hygelac I know,
ward of his folk, that, though few his years,
the lord of the Geats will give me aid
by word and by work, that well I may serve thee,
wielding the war-wood to win thy triumph
and lending thee might when thou lackest men.
If thy Hrethric should come to court of Geats,
a sovran's son, he will surely there
find his friends. A far-off land
each man should visit who vaunts him brave."
Him then answering, Hrothgar spake:  --
"These words of thine the wisest God
sent to thy soul! No sager counsel
from so young in years e'er yet have I heard.
Thou art strong of main and in mind art wary,
art wise in words! I ween indeed
if ever it hap that Hrethel's heir
by spear be seized, by sword-grim battle,
by illness or iron, thine elder and lord,
people's leader, -- and life be thine, --
no seemlier man will the Sea-Geats find
at all to choose for their chief and king,
for hoard-guard of heroes, if hold thou wilt
thy kinsman's kingdom! Thy keen mind pleases me
the longer the better, Beowulf loved!

Thou hast brought it about that both our peoples,
sons of the Geat and Spear-Dane folk,
shall have mutual peace, and from murderous strife,
such as once they waged, from war refrain.
Long as I rule this realm so wide,
let our hoards be common, let heroes with gold
each other greet o'er the gannet's-bath,
and the ringed-prow bear o'er rolling waves
tokens of love. I trow my landfolk
towards friend and foe are firmly joined,
and honor they keep in the olden way."
To him in the hall, then, Healfdene's son
gave treasures twelve, and the trust-of-earls
bade him fare with the gifts to his folk beloved,
hale to his home, and in haste return.
Then kissed the king of kin renowned,
Scyldings' chieftain, that choicest thane,
and fell on his neck. Fast flowed the tears
of the hoary-headed. Heavy with winters,
he had chances twain, but he clung to this, {26a} --
that each should look on the other again,
and hear him in hall. Was this hero so dear to him.
his breast's wild billows he banned in vain;
safe in his soul a secret longing,
locked in his mind, for that loved man
burned in his blood. Then Beowulf strode,
glad of his gold-gifts, the grass-plot o'er,
warrior blithe. The wave-roamer bode
riding at anchor, its owner awaiting.
As they hastened onward, Hrothgar's gift
they lauded at length. -- 'Twas a lord unpeered,
every way blameless, till age had broken
-- it spareth no mortal -- his splendid might.



XXVII

CAME now to ocean the ever-courageous
hardy henchmen, their harness bearing,
woven war-sarks. The warden marked,
trusty as ever, the earl's return.
From the height of the hill no hostile words
reached the guests as he rode to greet them;
but "Welcome!" he called to that Weder clan
as the sheen-mailed spoilers to ship marched on.
Then on the strand, with steeds and treasure
and armor their roomy and ring-dight ship
was heavily laden:  high its mast
rose over Hrothgar's hoarded gems.
A sword to the boat-guard Beowulf gave,
mounted with gold; on the mead-bench since
he was better esteemed, that blade possessing,
heirloom old. -- Their ocean-keel boarding,
they drove through the deep, and Daneland left.
A sea-cloth was set, a sail with ropes,
firm to the mast; the flood-timbers moaned; {27a}
nor did wind over billows that wave-swimmer blow
across from her course. The craft sped on,
foam-necked it floated forth o'er the waves,
keel firm-bound over briny currents,
till they got them sight of the Geatish cliffs,
home-known headlands. High the boat,
stirred by winds, on the strand updrove.
Helpful at haven the harbor-guard stood,
who long already for loved companions
by the water had waited and watched afar.
He bound to the beach the broad-bosomed ship
with anchor-bands, lest ocean-billows
that trusty timber should tear away.
Then Beowulf bade them bear the treasure,
gold and jewels; no journey far
was it thence to go to the giver of rings,
Hygelac Hrethling:  at home he dwelt
by the sea-wall close, himself and clan.
Haughty that house, a hero the king,
high the hall, and Hygd {27b} right young,
wise and wary, though winters few
in those fortress walls she had found a home,
Haereth's daughter. Nor humble her ways,
nor grudged she gifts to the Geatish men,
of precious treasure. Not Thryth's pride showed she,
folk-queen famed, or that fell deceit.
Was none so daring that durst make bold
(save her lord alone) of the liegemen dear
that lady full in the face to look,
but forged fetters he found his lot,
bonds of death! And brief the respite;
soon as they seized him, his sword-doom was spoken,
and the burnished blade a baleful murder
proclaimed and closed. No queenly way
for woman to practise, though peerless she,
that the weaver-of-peace {27c} from warrior dear
by wrath and lying his life should reave!
But Hemming's kinsman hindered this. --
For over their ale men also told
that of these folk-horrors fewer she wrought,
onslaughts of evil, after she went,
gold-decked bride, to the brave young prince,
atheling haughty, and Offa's hall
o'er the fallow flood at her father's bidding
safely sought, where since she prospered,
royal, throned, rich in goods,
fain of the fair life fate had sent her,
and leal in love to the lord of warriors.
He, of all heroes I heard of ever
from sea to sea, of the sons of earth,
most excellent seemed. Hence Offa was praised
for his fighting and feeing by far-off men,
the spear-bold warrior; wisely he ruled
over his empire. Eomer woke to him,
help of heroes, Hemming's kinsman,
Grandson of Garmund, grim in war.



XXVIII

HASTENED the hardy one, henchmen with him,
sandy strand of the sea to tread
and widespread ways. The world's great candle,
sun shone from south. They strode along
with sturdy steps to the spot they knew
where the battle-king young, his burg within,
slayer of Ongentheow, shared the rings,
shelter-of-heroes. To Hygelac
Beowulf's coming was quickly told, --
that there in the court the clansmen's refuge,
the shield-companion sound and alive,
hale from the hero-play homeward strode.
With haste in the hall, by highest order,
room for the rovers was readily made.
By his sovran he sat, come safe from battle,
kinsman by kinsman. His kindly lord
he first had greeted in gracious form,
with manly words. The mead dispensing,
came through the high hall Haereth's daughter,
winsome to warriors, wine-cup bore
to the hands of the heroes. Hygelac then
his comrade fairly with question plied
in the lofty hall, sore longing to know
what manner of sojourn the Sea-Geats made.
"What came of thy quest, my kinsman Beowulf,
when thy yearnings suddenly swept thee yonder
battle to seek o'er the briny sea,
combat in Heorot? Hrothgar couldst thou
aid at all, the honored chief,
in his wide-known woes? With waves of care
my sad heart seethed; I sore mistrusted
my loved one's venture:  long I begged thee
by no means to seek that slaughtering monster,
but suffer the South-Danes to settle their feud
themselves with Grendel. Now God be thanked
that safe and sound I can see thee now!"
Beowulf spake, the bairn of Ecgtheow:  --
"'Tis known and unhidden, Hygelac Lord,
to many men, that meeting of ours,
struggle grim between Grendel and me,
which we fought on the field where full too many
sorrows he wrought for the Scylding-Victors,
evils unending. These all I avenged.
No boast can be from breed of Grendel,
any on earth, for that uproar at dawn,
from the longest-lived of the loathsome race
in fleshly fold! -- But first I went
Hrothgar to greet in the hall of gifts,
where Healfdene's kinsman high-renowned,
soon as my purpose was plain to him,
assigned me a seat by his son and heir.
The liegemen were lusty; my life-days never
such merry men over mead in hall
have I heard under heaven! The high-born queen,
people's peace-bringer, passed through the hall,
cheered the young clansmen, clasps of gold,
ere she sought her seat, to sundry gave.
Oft to the heroes Hrothgar's daughter,
to earls in turn, the ale-cup tendered, --
she whom I heard these hall-companions
Freawaru name, when fretted gold
she proffered the warriors. Promised is she,
gold-decked maid, to the glad son of Froda.
Sage this seems to the Scylding's-friend,
kingdom's-keeper:  he counts it wise
the woman to wed so and ward off feud,
store of slaughter. But seldom ever
when men are slain, does the murder-spear sink
but briefest while, though the bride be fair! {28a}
"Nor haply will like it the Heathobard lord,
and as little each of his liegemen all,
when a thane of the Danes, in that doughty throng,
goes with the lady along their hall,
and on him the old-time heirlooms glisten
hard and ring-decked, Heathobard's treasure,
weapons that once they wielded fair
until they lost at the linden-play {28b}
liegeman leal and their lives as well.
Then, over the ale, on this heirloom gazing,
some ash-wielder old who has all in mind
that spear-death of men, {28c} -- he is stern of mood,
heavy at heart, -- in the hero young
tests the temper and tries the soul
and war-hate wakens, with words like these:  --
Canst thou not, comrade, ken that sword
which to the fray thy father carried
in his final feud, 'neath the fighting-mask,
dearest of blades, when the Danish slew him
and wielded the war-place on Withergild's fall,
after havoc of heroes, those hardy Scyldings?
Now, the son of a certain slaughtering Dane,
proud of his treasure, paces this hall,
joys in the killing, and carries the jewel {28d}
that rightfully ought to be owned by thee!_
Thus he urges and eggs him all the time
with keenest words, till occasion offers
that Freawaru's thane, for his father's deed,
after bite of brand in his blood must slumber,
losing his life; but that liegeman flies
living away, for the land he kens.
And thus be broken on both their sides
oaths of the earls, when Ingeld's breast
wells with war-hate, and wife-love now
after the care-billows cooler grows.
"So {28e} I hold not high the Heathobards' faith
due to the Danes, or their during love
and pact of peace. -- But I pass from that,
turning to Grendel, O giver-of-treasure,
and saying in full how the fight resulted,
hand-fray of heroes. When heaven's jewel
had fled o'er far fields, that fierce sprite came,
night-foe savage, to seek us out
where safe and sound we sentried the hall.
To Hondscio then was that harassing deadly,
his fall there was fated. He first was slain,
girded warrior. Grendel on him
turned murderous mouth, on our mighty kinsman,
and all of the brave man's body devoured.
Yet none the earlier, empty-handed,
would the bloody-toothed murderer, mindful of bale,
outward go from the gold-decked hall:
but me he attacked in his terror of might,
with greedy hand grasped me. A glove hung by him {28f}
wide and wondrous, wound with bands;
and in artful wise it all was wrought,
by devilish craft, of dragon-skins.
Me therein, an innocent man,
the fiendish foe was fain to thrust
with many another. He might not so,
when I all angrily upright stood.
'Twere long to relate how that land-destroyer
I paid in kind for his cruel deeds;
yet there, my prince, this people of thine
got fame by my fighting. He fled away,
and a little space his life preserved;
but there staid behind him his stronger hand
left in Heorot; heartsick thence
on the floor of the ocean that outcast fell.
Me for this struggle the Scyldings'-friend
paid in plenty with plates of gold,
with many a treasure, when morn had come
and we all at the banquet-board sat down.
Then was song and glee. The gray-haired Scylding,
much tested, told of the times of yore.
Whiles the hero his harp bestirred,
wood-of-delight; now lays he chanted
of sooth and sadness, or said aright
legends of wonder, the wide-hearted king;
or for years of his youth he would yearn at times,
for strength of old struggles, now stricken with age,
hoary hero:  his heart surged full
when, wise with winters, he wailed their flight.
Thus in the hall the whole of that day
at ease we feasted, till fell o'er earth
another night. Anon full ready
in greed of vengeance, Grendel's mother
set forth all doleful. Dead was her son
through war-hate of Weders; now, woman monstrous
with fury fell a foeman she slew,
avenged her offspring. From Aeschere old,
loyal councillor, life was gone;
nor might they e'en, when morning broke,
those Danish people, their death-done comrade
burn with brands, on balefire lay
the man they mourned. Under mountain stream
she had carried the corpse with cruel hands.
For Hrothgar that was the heaviest sorrow
of all that had laden the lord of his folk.
The leader then, by thy life, besought me
(sad was his soul) in the sea-waves' coil
to play the hero and hazard my being
for glory of prowess:  my guerdon he pledged.
I then in the waters -- 'tis widely known --
that sea-floor-guardian savage found.
Hand-to-hand there a while we struggled;
billows welled blood; in the briny hall
her head I hewed with a hardy blade
from Grendel's mother, -- and gained my life,
though not without danger. My doom was not yet.
Then the haven-of-heroes, Healfdene's son,
gave me in guerdon great gifts of price.



XXIX

"So held this king to the customs old,
that I wanted for nought in the wage I gained,
the meed of my might; he made me gifts,
Healfdene's heir, for my own disposal.
Now to thee, my prince, I proffer them all,
gladly give them. Thy grace alone
can find me favor. Few indeed
have I of kinsmen, save, Hygelac, thee!"
Then he bade them bear him the boar-head standard,
the battle-helm high, and breastplate gray,
the splendid sword; then spake in form:  --
"Me this war-gear the wise old prince,
Hrothgar, gave, and his hest he added,
that its story be straightway said to thee. --
A while it was held by Heorogar king,
for long time lord of the land of Scyldings;
yet not to his son the sovran left it,
to daring Heoroweard, -- dear as he was to him,
his harness of battle. -- Well hold thou it all!"
And I heard that soon passed o'er the path of this treasure,
all apple-fallow, four good steeds,
each like the others, arms and horses
he gave to the king. So should kinsmen be,
not weave one another the net of wiles,
or with deep-hid treachery death contrive
for neighbor and comrade. His nephew was ever
by hardy Hygelac held full dear,
and each kept watch o'er the other's weal.
I heard, too, the necklace to Hygd he presented,
wonder-wrought treasure, which Wealhtheow gave him
sovran's daughter:  three steeds he added,
slender and saddle-gay. Since such gift
the gem gleamed bright on the breast of the queen.
Thus showed his strain the son of Ecgtheow
as a man remarked for mighty deeds
and acts of honor. At ale he slew not
comrade or kin; nor cruel his mood,
though of sons of earth his strength was greatest,
a glorious gift that God had sent
the splendid leader. Long was he spurned,
and worthless by Geatish warriors held;
him at mead the master-of-clans
failed full oft to favor at all.
Slack and shiftless the strong men deemed him,
profitless prince; but payment came,
to the warrior honored, for all his woes. --
Then the bulwark-of-earls {29a} bade bring within,
hardy chieftain, Hrethel's heirloom
garnished with gold:  no Geat e'er knew
in shape of a sword a statelier prize.
The brand he laid in Beowulf's lap;
and of hides assigned him seven thousand, {29b}
with house and high-seat. They held in common
land alike by their line of birth,
inheritance, home:  but higher the king
because of his rule o'er the realm itself.

Now further it fell with the flight of years,
with harryings horrid, that Hygelac perished, {29c}
and Heardred, too, by hewing of swords
under the shield-wall slaughtered lay,
when him at the van of his victor-folk
sought hardy heroes, Heatho-Scilfings,
in arms o'erwhelming Hereric's nephew.
Then Beowulf came as king this broad
realm to wield; and he ruled it well
fifty winters, {29d} a wise old prince,
warding his land, until One began
in the dark of night, a Dragon, to rage.
In the grave on the hill a hoard it guarded,
in the stone-barrow steep. A strait path reached it,
unknown to mortals. Some man, however,
came by chance that cave within
to the heathen hoard. {29e} In hand he took
a golden goblet, nor gave he it back,
stole with it away, while the watcher slept,
by thievish wiles:  for the warden's wrath
prince and people must pay betimes!



XXX

THAT way he went with no will of his own,
in danger of life, to the dragon's hoard,
but for pressure of peril, some prince's thane.
He fled in fear the fatal scourge,
seeking shelter, a sinful man,
and entered in. At the awful sight
tottered that guest, and terror seized him;
yet the wretched fugitive rallied anon
from fright and fear ere he fled away,
and took the cup from that treasure-hoard.
Of such besides there was store enough,
heirlooms old, the earth below,
which some earl forgotten, in ancient years,
left the last of his lofty race,
heedfully there had hidden away,
dearest treasure. For death of yore
had hurried all hence; and he alone
left to live, the last of the clan,
weeping his friends, yet wished to bide
warding the treasure, his one delight,
though brief his respite. The barrow, new-ready,
to strand and sea-waves stood anear,
hard by the headland, hidden and closed;
there laid within it his lordly heirlooms
and heaped hoard of heavy gold
that warden of rings. Few words he spake:
"Now hold thou, earth, since heroes may not,
what earls have owned! Lo, erst from thee
brave men brought it! But battle-death seized
and cruel killing my clansmen all,
robbed them of life and a liegeman's joys.
None have I left to lift the sword,
or to cleanse the carven cup of price,
beaker bright. My brave are gone.
And the helmet hard, all haughty with gold,
shall part from its plating. Polishers sleep
who could brighten and burnish the battle-mask;
and those weeds of war that were wont to brave
over bicker of shields the bite of steel
rust with their bearer. The ringed mail
fares not far with famous chieftain,
at side of hero! No harp's delight,
no glee-wood's gladness! No good hawk now
flies through the hall! Nor horses fleet
stamp in the burgstead! Battle and death
the flower of my race have reft away."
Mournful of mood, thus he moaned his woe,
alone, for them all, and unblithe wept
by day and by night, till death's fell wave
o'erwhelmed his heart. His hoard-of-bliss
that old ill-doer open found,
who, blazing at twilight the barrows haunteth,
naked foe-dragon flying by night
folded in fire:  the folk of earth
dread him sore. 'Tis his doom to seek
hoard in the graves, and heathen gold
to watch, many-wintered:  nor wins he thereby!
Powerful this plague-of-the-people thus
held the house of the hoard in earth
three hundred winters; till One aroused
wrath in his breast, to the ruler bearing
that costly cup, and the king implored
for bond of peace. So the barrow was plundered,
borne off was booty. His boon was granted
that wretched man; and his ruler saw
first time what was fashioned in far-off days.
When the dragon awoke, new woe was kindled.
O'er the stone he snuffed. The stark-heart found
footprint of foe who so far had gone
in his hidden craft by the creature's head. --
So may the undoomed easily flee
evils and exile, if only he gain
the grace of The Wielder! -- That warden of gold
o'er the ground went seeking, greedy to find
the man who wrought him such wrong in sleep.
Savage and burning, the barrow he circled
all without; nor was any there,
none in the waste.... Yet war he desired,
was eager for battle. The barrow he entered,
sought the cup, and discovered soon
that some one of mortals had searched his treasure,
his lordly gold. The guardian waited
ill-enduring till evening came;
boiling with wrath was the barrow's keeper,
and fain with flame the foe to pay
for the dear cup's loss. -- Now day was fled
as the worm had wished. By its wall no more
was it glad to bide, but burning flew
folded in flame:  a fearful beginning
for sons of the soil; and soon it came,
in the doom of their lord, to a dreadful end.



XXXI

THEN the baleful fiend its fire belched out,
and bright homes burned. The blaze stood high
all landsfolk frighting. No living thing
would that loathly one leave as aloft it flew.
Wide was the dragon's warring seen,
its fiendish fury far and near,
as the grim destroyer those Geatish people
hated and hounded. To hidden lair,
to its hoard it hastened at hint of dawn.
Folk of the land it had lapped in flame,
with bale and brand. In its barrow it trusted,
its battling and bulwarks:  that boast was vain!

To Beowulf then the bale was told
quickly and truly:  the king's own home,
of buildings the best, in brand-waves melted,
that gift-throne of Geats. To the good old man
sad in heart, 'twas heaviest sorrow.
The sage assumed that his sovran God
he had angered, breaking ancient law,
and embittered the Lord. His breast within
with black thoughts welled, as his wont was never.
The folk's own fastness that fiery dragon
with flame had destroyed, and the stronghold all
washed by waves; but the warlike king,
prince of the Weders, plotted vengeance.
Warriors'-bulwark, he bade them work
all of iron -- the earl's commander --
a war-shield wondrous:  well he knew
that forest-wood against fire were worthless,
linden could aid not. -- Atheling brave,
he was fated to finish this fleeting life, {31a}
his days on earth, and the dragon with him,
though long it had watched o'er the wealth of the hoard! --
Shame he reckoned it, sharer-of-rings,
to follow the flyer-afar with a host,
a broad-flung band; nor the battle feared he,
nor deemed he dreadful the dragon's warring,
its vigor and valor:  ventures desperate
he had passed a-plenty, and perils of war,
contest-crash, since, conqueror proud,
Hrothgar's hall he had wholly purged,
and in grapple had killed the kin of Grendel,
loathsome breed! Not least was that
of hand-to-hand fights where Hygelac fell,
when the ruler of Geats in rush of battle,
lord of his folk, in the Frisian land,
son of Hrethel, by sword-draughts died,
by brands down-beaten. Thence Beowulf fled
through strength of himself and his swimming power,
though alone, and his arms were laden with thirty
coats of mail, when he came to the sea!
Nor yet might Hetwaras {31b} haughtily boast
their craft of contest, who carried against him
shields to the fight:  but few escaped
from strife with the hero to seek their homes!
Then swam over ocean Ecgtheow's son
lonely and sorrowful, seeking his land,
where Hygd made him offer of hoard and realm,
rings and royal-seat, reckoning naught
the strength of her son to save their kingdom
from hostile hordes, after Hygelac's death.
No sooner for this could the stricken ones
in any wise move that atheling's mind
over young Heardred's head as lord
and ruler of all the realm to be:
yet the hero upheld him with helpful words,
aided in honor, till, older grown,
he wielded the Weder-Geats. -- Wandering exiles
sought him o'er seas, the sons of Ohtere,
who had spurned the sway of the Scylfings'-helmet,
the bravest and best that broke the rings,
in Swedish land, of the sea-kings' line,
haughty hero. {31c} Hence Heardred's end.
For shelter he gave them, sword-death came,
the blade's fell blow, to bairn of Hygelac;
but the son of Ongentheow sought again
house and home when Heardred fell,
leaving Beowulf lord of Geats
and gift-seat's master. -- A good king he!



XXXII

THE fall of his lord he was fain to requite
in after days; and to Eadgils he proved
friend to the friendless, and forces sent
over the sea to the son of Ohtere,
weapons and warriors:  well repaid he
those care-paths cold when the king he slew. {32a}
Thus safe through struggles the son of Ecgtheow
had passed a plenty, through perils dire,
with daring deeds, till this day was come
that doomed him now with the dragon to strive.
With comrades eleven the lord of Geats
swollen in rage went seeking the dragon.
He had heard whence all the harm arose
and the killing of clansmen; that cup of price
on the lap of the lord had been laid by the finder.
In the throng was this one thirteenth man,
starter of all the strife and ill,
care-laden captive; cringing thence
forced and reluctant, he led them on
till he came in ken of that cavern-hall,
the barrow delved near billowy surges,
flood of ocean. Within 'twas full
of wire-gold and jewels; a jealous warden,
warrior trusty, the treasures held,
lurked in his lair. Not light the task
of entrance for any of earth-born men!
Sat on the headland the hero king,
spake words of hail to his hearth-companions,
gold-friend of Geats. All gloomy his soul,
wavering, death-bound. Wyrd full nigh
stood ready to greet the gray-haired man,
to seize his soul-hoard, sunder apart
life and body. Not long would be
the warrior's spirit enwound with flesh.
Beowulf spake, the bairn of Ecgtheow:  --
"Through store of struggles I strove in youth,
mighty feuds; I mind them all.
I was seven years old when the sovran of rings,
friend-of-his-folk, from my father took me,
had me, and held me, Hrethel the king,
with food and fee, faithful in kinship.
Ne'er, while I lived there, he loathlier found me,
bairn in the burg, than his birthright sons,
Herebeald and Haethcyn and Hygelac mine.
For the eldest of these, by unmeet chance,
by kinsman's deed, was the death-bed strewn,
when Haethcyn killed him with horny bow,
his own dear liege laid low with an arrow,
missed the mark and his mate shot down,
one brother the other, with bloody shaft.
A feeless fight, {32b} and a fearful sin,
horror to Hrethel; yet, hard as it was,
unavenged must the atheling die!
Too awful it is for an aged man
to bide and bear, that his bairn so young
rides on the gallows. A rime he makes,
sorrow-song for his son there hanging
as rapture of ravens; no rescue now
can come from the old, disabled man!
Still is he minded, as morning breaks,
of the heir gone elsewhere; {32c} another he hopes not
he will bide to see his burg within
as ward for his wealth, now the one has found
doom of death that the deed incurred.
Forlorn he looks on the lodge of his son,
wine-hall waste and wind-swept chambers
reft of revel. The rider sleepeth,
the hero, far-hidden; {32d} no harp resounds,
in the courts no wassail, as once was heard.



XXXIII

"THEN he goes to his chamber, a grief-song chants
alone for his lost. Too large all seems,
homestead and house. So the helmet-of-Weders
hid in his heart for Herebeald
waves of woe. No way could he take
to avenge on the slayer slaughter so foul;
nor e'en could he harass that hero at all
with loathing deed, though he loved him not.
And so for the sorrow his soul endured,
men's gladness he gave up and God's light chose.
Lands and cities he left his sons
(as the wealthy do) when he went from earth.
There was strife and struggle 'twixt Swede and Geat
o'er the width of waters; war arose,
hard battle-horror, when Hrethel died,
and Ongentheow's offspring grew
strife-keen, bold, nor brooked o'er the seas
pact of peace, but pushed their hosts
to harass in hatred by Hreosnabeorh.
Men of my folk for that feud had vengeance,
for woful war ('tis widely known),
though one of them bought it with blood of his heart,
a bargain hard:  for Haethcyn proved
fatal that fray, for the first-of-Geats.
At morn, I heard, was the murderer killed
by kinsman for kinsman, {33a} with clash of sword,
when Ongentheow met Eofor there.
Wide split the war-helm:  wan he fell,
hoary Scylfing; the hand that smote him
of feud was mindful, nor flinched from the death-blow.
-- "For all that he {33b} gave me, my gleaming sword
repaid him at war, -- such power I wielded, --
for lordly treasure:  with land he entrusted me,
homestead and house. He had no need
from Swedish realm, or from Spear-Dane folk,
or from men of the Gifths, to get him help, --
some warrior worse for wage to buy!
Ever I fought in the front of all,
sole to the fore; and so shall I fight
while I bide in life and this blade shall last
that early and late hath loyal proved
since for my doughtiness Daeghrefn fell,
slain by my hand, the Hugas' champion.
Nor fared he thence to the Frisian king
with the booty back, and breast-adornments;
but, slain in struggle, that standard-bearer
fell, atheling brave. Not with blade was he slain,
but his bones were broken by brawny gripe,
his heart-waves stilled. -- The sword-edge now,
hard blade and my hand, for the hoard shall strive."
Beowulf spake, and a battle-vow made
his last of all:  "I have lived through many
wars in my youth; now once again,
old folk-defender, feud will I seek,
do doughty deeds, if the dark destroyer
forth from his cavern come to fight me!"
Then hailed he the helmeted heroes all,
for the last time greeting his liegemen dear,
comrades of war:  "I should carry no weapon,
no sword to the serpent, if sure I knew
how, with such enemy, else my vows
I could gain as I did in Grendel's day.
But fire in this fight I must fear me now,
and poisonous breath; so I bring with me
breastplate and board. {33c} From the barrow's keeper
no footbreadth flee I. One fight shall end
our war by the wall, as Wyrd allots,
all mankind's master. My mood is bold
but forbears to boast o'er this battling-flyer.
-- Now abide by the barrow, ye breastplate-mailed,
ye heroes in harness, which of us twain
better from battle-rush bear his wounds.
Wait ye the finish. The fight is not yours,
nor meet for any but me alone
to measure might with this monster here
and play the hero. Hardily I
shall win that wealth, or war shall seize,
cruel killing, your king and lord!"
Up stood then with shield the sturdy champion,
stayed by the strength of his single manhood,
and hardy 'neath helmet his harness bore
under cleft of the cliffs:  no coward's path!
Soon spied by the wall that warrior chief,
survivor of many a victory-field
where foemen fought with furious clashings,
an arch of stone; and within, a stream
that broke from the barrow. The brooklet's wave
was hot with fire. The hoard that way
he never could hope unharmed to near,
or endure those deeps, {33d} for the dragon's flame.
Then let from his breast, for he burst with rage,
the Weder-Geat prince a word outgo;
stormed the stark-heart; stern went ringing
and clear his cry 'neath the cliff-rocks gray.
The hoard-guard heard a human voice;
his rage was enkindled. No respite now
for pact of peace! The poison-breath
of that foul worm first came forth from the cave,
hot reek-of-fight:  the rocks resounded.
Stout by the stone-way his shield he raised,
lord of the Geats, against the loathed-one;
while with courage keen that coiled foe
came seeking strife. The sturdy king
had drawn his sword, not dull of edge,
heirloom old; and each of the two
felt fear of his foe, though fierce their mood.
Stoutly stood with his shield high-raised
the warrior king, as the worm now coiled
together amain:  the mailed-one waited.
Now, spire by spire, fast sped and glided
that blazing serpent. The shield protected,
soul and body a shorter while
for the hero-king than his heart desired,
could his will have wielded the welcome respite
but once in his life! But Wyrd denied it,
and victory's honors. -- His arm he lifted
lord of the Geats, the grim foe smote
with atheling's heirloom. Its edge was turned
brown blade, on the bone, and bit more feebly
than its noble master had need of then
in his baleful stress. -- Then the barrow's keeper
waxed full wild for that weighty blow,
cast deadly flames; wide drove and far
those vicious fires. No victor's glory
the Geats' lord boasted; his brand had failed,
naked in battle, as never it should,
excellent iron! -- 'Twas no easy path
that Ecgtheow's honored heir must tread
over the plain to the place of the foe;
for against his will he must win a home
elsewhere far, as must all men, leaving
this lapsing life! -- Not long it was
ere those champions grimly closed again.
The hoard-guard was heartened; high heaved his breast
once more; and by peril was pressed again,
enfolded in flames, the folk-commander!
Nor yet about him his band of comrades,
sons of athelings, armed stood
with warlike front:  to the woods they bent them,
their lives to save. But the soul of one
with care was cumbered. Kinship true
can never be marred in a noble mind!



XXXIV

WIGLAF his name was, Weohstan's son,
linden-thane loved, the lord of Scylfings,
Aelfhere's kinsman. His king he now saw
with heat under helmet hard oppressed.
He minded the prizes his prince had given him,
wealthy seat of the Waegmunding line,
and folk-rights that his father owned
Not long he lingered. The linden yellow,
his shield, he seized; the old sword he drew:  --
as heirloom of Eanmund earth-dwellers knew it,
who was slain by the sword-edge, son of Ohtere,
friendless exile, erst in fray
killed by Weohstan, who won for his kin
brown-bright helmet, breastplate ringed,
old sword of Eotens, Onela's gift,
weeds of war of the warrior-thane,
battle-gear brave:  though a brother's child
had been felled, the feud was unfelt by Onela. {34a}
For winters this war-gear Weohstan kept,
breastplate and board, till his bairn had grown
earlship to earn as the old sire did:
then he gave him, mid Geats, the gear of battle,
portion huge, when he passed from life,
fared aged forth. For the first time now
with his leader-lord the liegeman young
was bidden to share the shock of battle.
Neither softened his soul, nor the sire's bequest
weakened in war. {34b} So the worm found out
when once in fight the foes had met!
Wiglaf spake, -- and his words were sage;
sad in spirit, he said to his comrades:  --
"I remember the time, when mead we took,
what promise we made to this prince of ours
in the banquet-hall, to our breaker-of-rings,
for gear of combat to give him requital,
for hard-sword and helmet, if hap should bring
stress of this sort! Himself who chose us
from all his army to aid him now,
urged us to glory, and gave these treasures,
because he counted us keen with the spear
and hardy 'neath helm, though this hero-work
our leader hoped unhelped and alone
to finish for us, -- folk-defender
who hath got him glory greater than all men
for daring deeds! Now the day is come
that our noble master has need of the might
of warriors stout. Let us stride along
the hero to help while the heat is about him
glowing and grim! For God is my witness
I am far more fain the fire should seize
along with my lord these limbs of mine! {34c}
Unsuiting it seems our shields to bear
homeward hence, save here we essay
to fell the foe and defend the life
of the Weders' lord. I wot 'twere shame
on the law of our land if alone the king
out of Geatish warriors woe endured
and sank in the struggle! My sword and helmet,
breastplate and board, for us both shall serve!"
Through slaughter-reek strode he to succor his chieftain,
his battle-helm bore, and brief words spake:  --
"Beowulf dearest, do all bravely,
as in youthful days of yore thou vowedst
that while life should last thou wouldst let no wise
thy glory droop! Now, great in deeds,
atheling steadfast, with all thy strength
shield thy life! I will stand to help thee."
At the words the worm came once again,
murderous monster mad with rage,
with fire-billows flaming, its foes to seek,
the hated men. In heat-waves burned
that board {34d} to the boss, and the breastplate failed
to shelter at all the spear-thane young.
Yet quickly under his kinsman's shield
went eager the earl, since his own was now
all burned by the blaze. The bold king again
had mind of his glory:  with might his glaive
was driven into the dragon's head, --
blow nerved by hate. But Naegling {34e} was shivered,
broken in battle was Beowulf's sword,
old and gray. 'Twas granted him not
that ever the edge of iron at all
could help him at strife:  too strong was his hand,
so the tale is told, and he tried too far
with strength of stroke all swords he wielded,
though sturdy their steel:  they steaded him nought.
Then for the third time thought on its feud
that folk-destroyer, fire-dread dragon,
and rushed on the hero, where room allowed,
battle-grim, burning; its bitter teeth
closed on his neck, and covered him
with waves of blood from his breast that welled.



XXXV

'TWAS now, men say, in his sovran's need
that the earl made known his noble strain,
craft and keenness and courage enduring.
Heedless of harm, though his hand was burned,
hardy-hearted, he helped his kinsman.
A little lower the loathsome beast
he smote with sword; his steel drove in
bright and burnished; that blaze began
to lose and lessen. At last the king
wielded his wits again, war-knife drew,
a biting blade by his breastplate hanging,
and the Weders'-helm smote that worm asunder,
felled the foe, flung forth its life.
So had they killed it, kinsmen both,
athelings twain:  thus an earl should be
in danger's day! -- Of deeds of valor
this conqueror's-hour of the king was last,
of his work in the world. The wound began,
which that dragon-of-earth had erst inflicted,
to swell and smart; and soon he found
in his breast was boiling, baleful and deep,
pain of poison. The prince walked on,
wise in his thought, to the wall of rock;
then sat, and stared at the structure of giants,
where arch of stone and steadfast column
upheld forever that hall in earth.
Yet here must the hand of the henchman peerless
lave with water his winsome lord,
the king and conqueror covered with blood,
with struggle spent, and unspan his helmet.
Beowulf spake in spite of his hurt,
his mortal wound; full well he knew
his portion now was past and gone
of earthly bliss, and all had fled
of his file of days, and death was near:
"I would fain bestow on son of mine
this gear of war, were given me now
that any heir should after me come
of my proper blood. This people I ruled
fifty winters. No folk-king was there,
none at all, of the neighboring clans
who war would wage me with 'warriors'-friends' {35a}
and threat me with horrors. At home I bided
what fate might come, and I cared for mine own;
feuds I sought not, nor falsely swore
ever on oath. For all these things,
though fatally wounded, fain am I!
From the Ruler-of-Man no wrath shall seize me,
when life from my frame must flee away,
for killing of kinsmen! Now quickly go
and gaze on that hoard 'neath the hoary rock,
Wiglaf loved, now the worm lies low,
sleeps, heart-sore, of his spoil bereaved.
And fare in haste. I would fain behold
the gorgeous heirlooms, golden store,
have joy in the jewels and gems, lay down
softlier for sight of this splendid hoard
my life and the lordship I long have held."



XXXVI

I HAVE heard that swiftly the son of Weohstan
at wish and word of his wounded king, --
war-sick warrior, -- woven mail-coat,
battle-sark, bore 'neath the barrow's roof.
Then the clansman keen, of conquest proud,
passing the seat, {36a} saw store of jewels
and glistening gold the ground along;
by the wall were marvels, and many a vessel
in the den of the dragon, the dawn-flier old:
unburnished bowls of bygone men
reft of richness; rusty helms
of the olden age; and arm-rings many
wondrously woven. -- Such wealth of gold,
booty from barrow, can burden with pride
each human wight:  let him hide it who will! --
His glance too fell on a gold-wove banner
high o'er the hoard, of handiwork noblest,
brilliantly broidered; so bright its gleam,
all the earth-floor he easily saw
and viewed all these vessels. No vestige now
was seen of the serpent:  the sword had ta'en him.
Then, I heard, the hill of its hoard was reft,
old work of giants, by one alone;
he burdened his bosom with beakers and plate
at his own good will, and the ensign took,
brightest of beacons. -- The blade of his lord
-- its edge was iron -- had injured deep
one that guarded the golden hoard
many a year and its murder-fire
spread hot round the barrow in horror-billows
at midnight hour, till it met its doom.
Hasted the herald, the hoard so spurred him
his track to retrace; he was troubled by doubt,
high-souled hero, if haply he'd find
alive, where he left him, the lord of Weders,
weakening fast by the wall of the cave.
So he carried the load. His lord and king
he found all bleeding, famous chief
at the lapse of life. The liegeman again
plashed him with water, till point of word
broke through the breast-hoard. Beowulf spake,
sage and sad, as he stared at the gold. --
"For the gold and treasure, to God my thanks,
to the Wielder-of-Wonders, with words I say,
for what I behold, to Heaven's Lord,
for the grace that I give such gifts to my folk
or ever the day of my death be run!
Now I've bartered here for booty of treasure
the last of my life, so look ye well
to the needs of my land! No longer I tarry.
A barrow bid ye the battle-fanned raise
for my ashes. 'Twill shine by the shore of the flood,
to folk of mine memorial fair
on Hrones Headland high uplifted,
that ocean-wanderers oft may hail
Beowulf's Barrow, as back from far
they drive their keels o'er the darkling wave."
From his neck he unclasped the collar of gold,
valorous king, to his vassal gave it
with bright-gold helmet, breastplate, and ring,
to the youthful thane:  bade him use them in joy.
"Thou art end and remnant of all our race
the Waegmunding name. For Wyrd hath swept them,
all my line, to the land of doom,
earls in their glory:  I after them go."
This word was the last which the wise old man
harbored in heart ere hot death-waves
of balefire he chose. From his bosom fled
his soul to seek the saints' reward.



XXXVII

IT was heavy hap for that hero young
on his lord beloved to look and find him
lying on earth with life at end,
sorrowful sight. But the slayer too,
awful earth-dragon, empty of breath,
lay felled in fight, nor, fain of its treasure,
could the writhing monster rule it more.
For edges of iron had ended its days,
hard and battle-sharp, hammers' leaving; {37a}
and that flier-afar had fallen to ground
hushed by its hurt, its hoard all near,
no longer lusty aloft to whirl
at midnight, making its merriment seen,
proud of its prizes:  prone it sank
by the handiwork of the hero-king.
Forsooth among folk but few achieve,
-- though sturdy and strong, as stories tell me,
and never so daring in deed of valor, --
the perilous breath of a poison-foe
to brave, and to rush on the ring-board hall,
whenever his watch the warden keeps
bold in the barrow. Beowulf paid
the price of death for that precious hoard;
and each of the foes had found the end
of this fleeting life.
Befell erelong
that the laggards in war the wood had left,
trothbreakers, cowards, ten together,
fearing before to flourish a spear
in the sore distress of their sovran lord.
Now in their shame their shields they carried,
armor of fight, where the old man lay;
and they gazed on Wiglaf. Wearied he sat
at his sovran's shoulder, shieldsman good,
to wake him with water. {37b} Nowise it availed.
Though well he wished it, in world no more
could he barrier life for that leader-of-battles
nor baffle the will of all-wielding God.
Doom of the Lord was law o'er the deeds
of every man, as it is to-day.
Grim was the answer, easy to get,
from the youth for those that had yielded to fear!
Wiglaf spake, the son of Weohstan, --
mournful he looked on those men unloved:  --
"Who sooth will speak, can say indeed
that the ruler who gave you golden rings
and the harness of war in which ye stand
-- for he at ale-bench often-times
bestowed on hall-folk helm and breastplate,
lord to liegemen, the likeliest gear
which near of far he could find to give, --
threw away and wasted these weeds of battle,
on men who failed when the foemen came!
Not at all could the king of his comrades-in-arms
venture to vaunt, though the Victory-Wielder,
God, gave him grace that he got revenge
sole with his sword in stress and need.
To rescue his life, 'twas little that I
could serve him in struggle; yet shift I made
(hopeless it seemed) to help my kinsman.
Its strength ever waned, when with weapon I struck
that fatal foe, and the fire less strongly
flowed from its head. -- Too few the heroes
in throe of contest that thronged to our king!
Now gift of treasure and girding of sword,
joy of the house and home-delight
shall fail your folk; his freehold-land
every clansman within your kin
shall lose and leave, when lords high-born
hear afar of that flight of yours,
a fameless deed. Yea, death is better
for liegemen all than a life of shame!"



XXXVIII

THAT battle-toil bade he at burg to announce,
at the fort on the cliff, where, full of sorrow,
all the morning earls had sat,
daring shieldsmen, in doubt of twain:
would they wail as dead, or welcome home,
their lord beloved? Little {38a} kept back
of the tidings new, but told them all,
the herald that up the headland rode. --
"Now the willing-giver to Weder folk
in death-bed lies; the Lord of Geats
on the slaughter-bed sleeps by the serpent's deed!
And beside him is stretched that slayer-of-men
with knife-wounds sick:  {38b} no sword availed
on the awesome thing in any wise
to work a wound. There Wiglaf sitteth,
Weohstan's bairn, by Beowulf's side,
the living earl by the other dead,
and heavy of heart a head-watch {38c} keeps
o'er friend and foe. -- Now our folk may look
for waging of war when once unhidden
to Frisian and Frank the fall of the king
is spread afar. -- The strife began
when hot on the Hugas {38d} Hygelac fell
and fared with his fleet to the Frisian land.
Him there the Hetwaras humbled in war,
plied with such prowess their power o'erwhelming
that the bold-in-battle bowed beneath it
and fell in fight. To his friends no wise
could that earl give treasure! And ever since
the Merowings' favor has failed us wholly.
Nor aught expect I of peace and faith
from Swedish folk. 'Twas spread afar
how Ongentheow reft at Ravenswood
Haethcyn Hrethling of hope and life,
when the folk of Geats for the first time sought
in wanton pride the Warlike-Scylfings.
Soon the sage old sire {38e} of Ohtere,
ancient and awful, gave answering blow;
the sea-king {38f} he slew, and his spouse redeemed,
his good wife rescued, though robbed of her gold,
mother of Ohtere and Onela.
Then he followed his foes, who fled before him
sore beset and stole their way,
bereft of a ruler, to Ravenswood.

With his host he besieged there what swords had left,
the weary and wounded; woes he threatened
the whole night through to that hard-pressed throng:
some with the morrow his sword should kill,
some should go to the gallows-tree
for rapture of ravens. But rescue came
with dawn of day for those desperate men
when they heard the horn of Hygelac sound,
tones of his trumpet; the trusty king
had followed their trail with faithful band.



XXXIX

"THE bloody swath of Swedes and Geats
and the storm of their strife, were seen afar,
how folk against folk the fight had wakened.
The ancient king with his atheling band
sought his citadel, sorrowing much:
Ongentheow earl went up to his burg.
He had tested Hygelac's hardihood,
the proud one's prowess, would prove it no longer,
defied no more those fighting-wanderers
nor hoped from the seamen to save his hoard,
his bairn and his bride:  so he bent him again,
old, to his earth-walls. Yet after him came
with slaughter for Swedes the standards of Hygelac
o'er peaceful plains in pride advancing,
till Hrethelings fought in the fenced town. {39a}
Then Ongentheow with edge of sword,
the hoary-bearded, was held at bay,
and the folk-king there was forced to suffer
Eofor's anger. In ire, at the king
Wulf Wonreding with weapon struck;
and the chieftain's blood, for that blow, in streams
flowed 'neath his hair. No fear felt he,
stout old Scylfing, but straightway repaid
in better bargain that bitter stroke
and faced his foe with fell intent.
Nor swift enough was the son of Wonred
answer to render the aged chief;
too soon on his head the helm was cloven;
blood-bedecked he bowed to earth,
and fell adown; not doomed was he yet,
and well he waxed, though the wound was sore.
Then the hardy Hygelac-thane, {39b}
when his brother fell, with broad brand smote,
giants' sword crashing through giants'-helm
across the shield-wall:  sank the king,
his folk's old herdsman, fatally hurt.
There were many to bind the brother's wounds
and lift him, fast as fate allowed
his people to wield the place-of-war.
But Eofor took from Ongentheow,
earl from other, the iron-breastplate,
hard sword hilted, and helmet too,
and the hoar-chief's harness to Hygelac carried,
who took the trappings, and truly promised
rich fee 'mid folk, -- and fulfilled it so.
For that grim strife gave the Geatish lord,
Hrethel's offspring, when home he came,
to Eofor and Wulf a wealth of treasure,
Each of them had a hundred thousand {39c}
in land and linked rings; nor at less price reckoned
mid-earth men such mighty deeds!
And to Eofor he gave his only daughter
in pledge of grace, the pride of his home.

"Such is the feud, the foeman's rage,
death-hate of men:  so I deem it sure
that the Swedish folk will seek us home
for this fall of their friends, the fighting-Scylfings,
when once they learn that our warrior leader
lifeless lies, who land and hoard
ever defended from all his foes,
furthered his folk's weal, finished his course
a hardy hero. -- Now haste is best,
that we go to gaze on our Geatish lord,
and bear the bountiful breaker-of-rings
to the funeral pyre. No fragments merely
shall burn with the warrior. Wealth of jewels,
gold untold and gained in terror,
treasure at last with his life obtained,
all of that booty the brands shall take,
fire shall eat it. No earl must carry
memorial jewel. No maiden fair
shall wreathe her neck with noble ring:
nay, sad in spirit and shorn of her gold,
oft shall she pass o'er paths of exile
now our lord all laughter has laid aside,
all mirth and revel. Many a spear
morning-cold shall be clasped amain,
lifted aloft; nor shall lilt of harp
those warriors wake; but the wan-hued raven,
fain o'er the fallen, his feast shall praise
and boast to the eagle how bravely he ate
when he and the wolf were wasting the slain."

So he told his sorrowful tidings,
and little {39d} he lied, the loyal man
of word or of work. The warriors rose;
sad, they climbed to the Cliff-of-Eagles,
went, welling with tears, the wonder to view.
Found on the sand there, stretched at rest,
their lifeless lord, who had lavished rings
of old upon them. Ending-day
had dawned on the doughty-one; death had seized
in woful slaughter the Weders' king.
There saw they, besides, the strangest being,
loathsome, lying their leader near,
prone on the field. The fiery dragon,
fearful fiend, with flame was scorched.
Reckoned by feet, it was fifty measures
in length as it lay. Aloft erewhile
it had revelled by night, and anon come back,
seeking its den; now in death's sure clutch
it had come to the end of its earth-hall joys.
By it there stood the stoups and jars;
dishes lay there, and dear-decked swords
eaten with rust, as, on earth's lap resting,
a thousand winters they waited there.
For all that heritage huge, that gold
of bygone men, was bound by a spell, {39e}
so the treasure-hall could be touched by none
of human kind, -- save that Heaven's King,
God himself, might give whom he would,
Helper of Heroes, the hoard to open, --
even such a man as seemed to him meet.



XL

A PERILOUS path, it proved, he {40a} trod
who heinously hid, that hall within,
wealth under wall! Its watcher had killed
one of a few, {40b} and the feud was avenged
in woful fashion. Wondrous seems it,
what manner a man of might and valor
oft ends his life, when the earl no longer
in mead-hall may live with loving friends.
So Beowulf, when that barrow's warden
he sought, and the struggle; himself knew not
in what wise he should wend from the world at last.
For {40c} princes potent, who placed the gold,
with a curse to doomsday covered it deep,
so that marked with sin the man should be,
hedged with horrors, in hell-bonds fast,
racked with plagues, who should rob their hoard.
Yet no greed for gold, but the grace of heaven,
ever the king had kept in view. {40d}
Wiglaf spake, the son of Weohstan:  --
"At the mandate of one, oft warriors many
sorrow must suffer; and so must we.
The people's-shepherd showed not aught
of care for our counsel, king beloved!
That guardian of gold he should grapple not, urged we,
but let him lie where he long had been
in his earth-hall waiting the end of the world,
the hest of heaven. -- This hoard is ours
but grievously gotten; too grim the fate
which thither carried our king and lord.
I was within there, and all I viewed,
the chambered treasure, when chance allowed me
(and my path was made in no pleasant wise)
under the earth-wall. Eager, I seized
such heap from the hoard as hands could bear
and hurriedly carried it hither back
to my liege and lord. Alive was he still,
still wielding his wits. The wise old man
spake much in his sorrow, and sent you greetings
and bade that ye build, when he breathed no more,
on the place of his balefire a barrow high,
memorial mighty. Of men was he
worthiest warrior wide earth o'er
the while he had joy of his jewels and burg.
Let us set out in haste now, the second time
to see and search this store of treasure,
these wall-hid wonders, -- the way I show you, --
where, gathered near, ye may gaze your fill
at broad-gold and rings. Let the bier, soon made,
be all in order when out we come,
our king and captain to carry thither
-- man beloved -- where long he shall bide
safe in the shelter of sovran God."
Then the bairn of Weohstan bade command,
hardy chief, to heroes many
that owned their homesteads, hither to bring
firewood from far -- o'er the folk they ruled --
for the famed-one's funeral. " Fire shall devour
and wan flames feed on the fearless warrior
who oft stood stout in the iron-shower,
when, sped from the string, a storm of arrows
shot o'er the shield-wall:  the shaft held firm,
featly feathered, followed the barb."
And now the sage young son of Weohstan
seven chose of the chieftain's thanes,
the best he found that band within,
and went with these warriors, one of eight,
under hostile roof. In hand one bore
a lighted torch and led the way.
No lots they cast for keeping the hoard
when once the warriors saw it in hall,
altogether without a guardian,
lying there lost. And little they mourned
when they had hastily haled it out,
dear-bought treasure! The dragon they cast,
the worm, o'er the wall for the wave to take,
and surges swallowed that shepherd of gems.
Then the woven gold on a wain was laden --
countless quite! -- and the king was borne,
hoary hero, to Hrones-Ness.



XLI

THEN fashioned for him the folk of Geats
firm on the earth a funeral-pile,
and hung it with helmets and harness of war
and breastplates bright, as the boon he asked;
and they laid amid it the mighty chieftain,
heroes mourning their master dear.
Then on the hill that hugest of balefires
the warriors wakened. Wood-smoke rose
black over blaze, and blent was the roar
of flame with weeping (the wind was still),
till the fire had broken the frame of bones,
hot at the heart. In heavy mood
their misery moaned they, their master's death.
Wailing her woe, the widow {41a} old,
her hair upbound, for Beowulf's death
sung in her sorrow, and said full oft
she dreaded the doleful days to come,
deaths enow, and doom of battle,
and shame. -- The smoke by the sky was devoured.
The folk of the Weders fashioned there
on the headland a barrow broad and high,
by ocean-farers far descried:
in ten days' time their toil had raised it,
the battle-brave's beacon. Round brands of the pyre
a wall they built, the worthiest ever
that wit could prompt in their wisest men.
They placed in the barrow that precious booty,
the rounds and the rings they had reft erewhile,
hardy heroes, from hoard in cave, --
trusting the ground with treasure of earls,
gold in the earth, where ever it lies
useless to men as of yore it was.
Then about that barrow the battle-keen rode,
atheling-born, a band of twelve,
lament to make, to mourn their king,
chant their dirge, and their chieftain honor.
They praised his earlship, his acts of prowess
worthily witnessed:  and well it is
that men their master-friend mightily laud,
heartily love, when hence he goes
from life in the body forlorn away.

Thus made their mourning the men of Geatland,
for their hero's passing his hearth-companions:
quoth that of all the kings of earth,
of men he was mildest and most beloved,
to his kin the kindest, keenest for praise.



Footnotes:

{0a} Not, of course, Beowulf the Great, hero of the epic.

{0b} Kenning for king or chieftain of a comitatus:  he breaks off
gold from the spiral rings -- often worn on the arm -- and so
rewards his followers.

{1a} That is, "The Hart," or "Stag," so called from decorations in
the gables that resembled the antlers of a deer. This hall has been
carefully described in a pamphlet by Heyne. The building was
rectangular, with opposite doors -- mainly west and east -- and a
hearth in the middle of th single room. A row of pillars down each
side, at some distance from the walls, made a space which was raised
a little above the main floor, and was furnished with two rows of
seats. On one side, usually south, was the high-seat midway between
the doors. Opposite this, on the other raised space, was another
seat of honor. At the banquet soon to be described, Hrothgar sat in
the south or chief high-seat, and Beowulf opposite to him. The scene
for a flying (see below, v.499) was thus very effectively set.
Planks on trestles -- the "board" of later English literature --
formed the tables just in front of the long rows of seats, and were
taken away after banquets, when the retainers were ready to stretch
themselves out for sleep on the benches.

{1b} Fire was the usual end of these halls. See v. 781 below. One
thinks of the splendid scene at the end of the Nibelungen, of the
Nialssaga, of Saxo's story of Amlethus, and many a less famous
instance.

{1c} It is to be supposed that all hearers of this poem knew how
Hrothgar's hall was burnt, -- perhaps in the unsuccessful attack
made on him by his son-in-law Ingeld.

{1d} A skilled minstrel. The Danes are heathens, as one is told
presently; but this lay of beginnings is taken from Genesis.

{1e} A disturber of the border, one who sallies from his haunt in
the fen and roams over the country near by. This probably pagan
nuisance is now furnished with biblical credentials as a fiend or
devil in good standing, so that all Christian Englishmen might read
about him. "Grendel" may mean one who grinds and crushes.

{1f} Cain's.

{1g} Giants.

{2a} The smaller buildings within the main enclosure but separate
from the hall.

{2b} Grendel.

{2c} "Sorcerers-of-hell."

{2d} Hrothgar, who is the "Scyldings'-friend" of 170.

{2e} That is, in formal or prescribed phrase.

{3a} Ship.

{3b} That is, since Beowulf selected his ship and led his men to the
harbor.

{3c} One of the auxiliary names of the Geats.

{3d} Or:  Not thus openly ever came warriors hither; yet...

{4a} Hrothgar.

{4b} Beowulf's helmet has several boar-images on it; he is the "man
of war"; and the boar-helmet guards him as typical representative of
the marching party as a whole. The boar was sacred to Freyr, who was
the favorite god of the Germanic tribes about the North Sea and the
Baltic. Rude representations of warriors show the boar on the helmet
quite as large as the helmet itself.

{5a} Either merely paved, the strata via of the Romans, or else
thought of as a sort of mosaic, an extravagant touch like the
reckless waste of gold on the walls and roofs of a hall.

{6a} The nicor, says Bugge, is a hippopotamus; a walrus, says Ten
Brink. But that water-goblin who covers the space from Old Nick of
jest to the Neckan and Nix of poetry and tale, is all one needs, and
Nicor is a good name for him.

{6b} His own people, the Geats.

{6c} That is, cover it as with a face-cloth. "There will be no need
of funeral rites."

{6d} Personification of Battle.

{6e} The Germanic Vulcan.

{6f} This mighty power, whom the Christian poet can still revere,
has here the general force of "Destiny."

{7a} There is no irrelevance here. Hrothgar sees in Beowulf's
mission a heritage of duty, a return of the good offices which the
Danish king rendered to Beowulf's father in time of dire need.

{7b} Money, for wergild, or man-price.

{7c} Ecgtheow, Beowulf's sire.

{8a} "Began the fight."

{8b} Breca.

{9a} Murder.

{10a} Beowulf, -- the "one."

{11a} That is, he was a "lost soul," doomed to hell.

{12a} Kenning for Beowulf.

{13a} "Guarded the treasure."

{13b} Sc. Heremod.

{13c} The singer has sung his lays, and the epic resumes its story.
The time-relations are not altogether good in this long passage
which describes the rejoicings of "the day after"; but the present
shift from the riders on the road to the folk at the hall is not
very violent, and is of a piece with the general style.

{14a} Unferth, Beowulf's sometime opponent in the flyting.

{15a} There is no horrible inconsistency here such as the critics
strive and cry about. In spite of the ruin that Grendel and Beowulf
had made within the hall, the framework and roof held firm, and
swift repairs made the interior habitable. Tapestries were hung on
the walls, and willing hands prepared the banquet.

{15b} From its formal use in other places, this phrase, to take cup
in hall, or "on the floor," would seem to mean that Beowulf stood up
to receive his gifts, drink to the donor, and say thanks.

{15c} Kenning for sword.

{15d} Hrothgar. He is also the "refuge of the friends of Ing,"
below. Ing belongs to myth.

{15e} Horses are frequently led or ridden into the hall where folk
sit at banquet:  so in Chaucer's Squire's tale, in the ballad of
King Estmere, and in the romances.

{16a} Man-price, wergild.

{16b} Beowulf's.

{16c} Hrothgar.

{16d} There is no need to assume a gap in the Ms. As before about
Sigemund and Heremod, so now, though at greater length, about Finn
and his feud, a lay is chanted or recited; and the epic poet,
counting on his readers' familiarity with the story, -- a fragment
of it still exists, -- simply gives the headings.

{16e} The exact story to which this episode refers in summary is not
to be determined, but the following account of it is reasonable and
has good support among scholars. Finn, a Frisian chieftain, who
nevertheless has a "castle" outside the Frisian border, marries
Hildeburh, a Danish princess; and her brother, Hnaef, with many
other Danes, pays Finn a visit. Relations between the two peoples
have been strained before. Something starts the old feud anew; and
the visitors are attacked in their quarters. Hnaef is killed; so is
a son of Hildeburh. Many fall on both sides. Peace is patched up; a
stately funeral is held; and the surviving visitors become in a way
vassals or liegemen of Finn, going back with him to Frisia. So
matters rest a while. Hengest is now leader of the Danes; but he is
set upon revenge for his former lord, Hnaef. Probably he is killed
in feud; but his clansmen, Guthlaf and Oslaf, gather at their home a
force of sturdy Danes, come back to Frisia, storm Finn's stronghold,
kill him, and carry back their kinswoman Hildeburh.

{16f} The "enemies" must be the Frisians.

{16g} Battlefield. -- Hengest is the "prince's thane," companion of
Hnaef. "Folcwald's son" is Finn.

{16h} That is, Finn would govern in all honor the few Danish
warriors who were left, provided, of course, that none of them tried
to renew the quarrel or avenge Hnaef their fallen lord. If, again,
one of Finn's Frisians began a quarrel, he should die by the sword.

{16i} Hnaef.

{16j} The high place chosen for the funeral:  see description of
Beowulf's funeral-pile at the end of the poem.

{16k} Wounds.

{17a} That is, these two Danes, escaping home, had told the story of
the attack on Hnaef, the slaying of Hengest, and all the Danish
woes. Collecting a force, they return to Frisia and kill Finn in his
home.

{17b} Nephew to Hrothgar, with whom he subsequently quarrels, and
elder cousin to the two young sons of Hrothgar and Wealhtheow, --
their natural guardian in the event of the king's death. There is
something finely feminine in this speech of Wealhtheow's, apart from
its somewhat irregular and irrelevant sequence of topics. Both she
and her lord probably distrust Hrothulf; but she bids the king to be
of good cheer, and, turning to the suspect, heaps affectionate
assurances on his probity. "My own Hrothulf" will surely not forget
these favors and benefits of the past, but will repay them to the
orphaned boy.

{19a} They had laid their arms on the benches near where they slept.

{20a} He surmises presently where she is.

{20b} The connection is not difficult. The words of mourning, of
acute grief, are said; and according to Germanic sequence of
thought, inexorable here, the next and only topic is revenge. But is
it possible? Hrothgar leads up to his appeal and promise with a
skillful and often effective description of the horrors which
surround the monster's home and await the attempt of an avenging
foe.

{21a} Hrothgar is probably meant.

{21b} Meeting place.

{22a} Kenning for "sword." Hrunting is bewitched, laid under a spell
of uselessness, along with all other swords.

{22b} This brown of swords, evidently meaning burnished, bright,
continues to be a favorite adjective in the popular ballads.

{23a} After the killing of the monster and Grendel's decapitation.

{23b} Hrothgar.

{23c} The blade slowly dissolves in blood-stained drops like
icicles.

{23d} Spear.

{24a} That is, "whoever has as wide authority as I have and can
remember so far back so many instances of heroism, may well say, as
I say, that no better hero ever lived than Beowulf."

{25a} That is, he is now undefended by conscience from the
temptations (shafts) of the devil.

{25b} Kenning for the sun. -- This is a strange role for the raven.
He is the warrior's bird of battle, exults in slaughter and carnage;
his joy here is a compliment to the sunrise.

{26a} That is, he might or might not see Beowulf again. Old as he
was, the latter chance was likely; but he clung to the former,
hoping to see his young friend again "and exchange brave words in
the hall."

{27a} With the speed of the boat.

{27b} Queen to Hygelac. She is praised by contrast with the
antitype, Thryth, just as Beowulf was praised by contrast with
Heremod.

{27c} Kenning for "wife."

{28a} Beowulf gives his uncle the king not mere gossip of his
journey, but a statesmanlike forecast of the outcome of certain
policies at the Danish court. Talk of interpolation here is absurd.
As both Beowulf and Hygelac know, -- and the folk for whom the
Beowulf was put together also knew, -- Froda was king of the
Heathobards (probably the Langobards, once near neighbors of Angle
and Saxon tribes on the continent), and had fallen in fight with the
Danes. Hrothgar will set aside this feud by giving his daughter as
"peace-weaver" and wife to the young king Ingeld, son of the slain
Froda. But Beowulf, on general principles and from his observation
of the particular case, foretells trouble. Note:

{28b} Play of shields, battle. A Danish warrior cuts down Froda in
the fight, and takes his sword and armor, leaving them to a son.
This son is selected to accompany his mistress, the young princess
Freawaru, to her new home when she is Ingeld's queen. Heedlessly he
wears the sword of Froda in hall. An old warrior points it out to
Ingeld, and eggs him on to vengeance. At his instigation the Dane is
killed; but the murderer, afraid of results, and knowing the land,
escapes. So the old feud must break out again.

{28c} That is, their disastrous battle and the slaying of their
king.

{28d} The sword.

{28e} Beowulf returns to his forecast. Things might well go somewhat
as follows, he says; sketches a little tragic story; and with this
prophecy by illustration returns to the tale of his adventure.

{28f} Not an actual glove, but a sort of bag.

{29a} Hygelac.

{29b} This is generally assumed to mean hides, though the text
simply says "seven thousand." A hide in England meant about 120
acres, though "the size of the acre varied."

{29c} On the historical raid into Frankish territory between 512 and
520 A.D. The subsequent course of events, as gathered from hints of
this epic, is partly told in Scandinavian legend.

{29d} The chronology of this epic, as scholars have worked it out,
would make Beowulf well over ninety years of age when he fights the
dragon. But the fifty years of his reign need not be taken as
historical fact.

{29e} The text is here hopelessly illegible, and only the general
drift of the meaning can be rescued. For one thing, we have the old
myth of a dragon who guards hidden treasure. But with this runs the
story of some noble, last of his race, who hides all his wealth
within this barrow and there chants his farewell to life's glories.
After his death the dragon takes possession of the hoard and watches
over it. A condemned or banished man, desperate, hides in the
barrow, discovers the treasure, and while the dragon sleeps, makes
off with a golden beaker or the like, and carries it for
propitiation to his master. The dragon discovers the loss and exacts
fearful penalty from the people round about.

{31a} Literally "loan-days," days loaned to man.

{31b} Chattuarii, a tribe that dwelt along the Rhine, and took part
in repelling the raid of (Hygelac) Chocilaicus.

{31c} Onla, son of Ongentheow, who pursues his two nephews Eanmund
and Eadgils to Heardred's court, where they have taken refuge after
their unsuccessful rebellion. In the fighting Heardred is killed.

{32a} That is, Beowulf supports Eadgils against Onela, who is slain
by Eadgils in revenge for the "care-paths" of exile into which Onela
forced him.

{32b} That is, the king could claim no wergild, or man-price, from
one son for the killing of the other.

{32c} Usual euphemism for death.

{32d} Sc. in the grave.

{33a} Eofor for Wulf. -- The immediate provocation for Eofor in
killing "the hoary Scylfing," Ongentheow, is that the latter has
just struck Wulf down; but the king, Haethcyn, is also avenged by
the blow. See the detailed description below.

{33b} Hygelac.

{33c} Shield.

{33d} The hollow passage.

{34a} That is, although Eanmund was brother's son to Onela, the
slaying of the former by Weohstan is not felt as cause of feud, and
is rewarded by gift of the slain man's weapons.

{34b} Both Wiglaf and the sword did their duty. -- The following is
one of the classic passages for illustrating the comitatus as the
most conspicuous Germanic institution, and its underlying sense of
duty, based partly on the idea of loyalty and partly on the
practical basis of benefits received and repaid.

{34c} Sc. "than to bide safely here," -- a common figure of
incomplete comparison.

{34d} Wiglaf's wooden shield.

{34e} Gering would translate "kinsman of the nail," as both are made
of iron.

{35a} That is, swords.

{36a} Where Beowulf lay.

{37a} What had been left or made by the hammer; well-forged.

{37b} Trying to revive him.

{38a} Nothing.

{38b} Dead.

{38c} Death-watch, guard of honor, "lyke-wake."

{38d} A name for the Franks.

{38e} Ongentheow.

{38f} Haethcyn.

{39a} The line may mean:  till Hrethelings stormed on the hedged
shields, -- i.e. the shield-wall or hedge of defensive war --
Hrethelings, of course, are Geats.

{39b} Eofor, brother to Wulf Wonreding.

{39c} Sc. "value in" hides and the weight of the gold.

{39d} Not at all.

{39e} Laid on it when it was put in the barrow. This spell, or in
our days the "curse," either prevented discovery or brought dire
ills on the finder and taker.

{40a} Probably the fugitive is meant who discovered the hoard. Ten
Brink and Gering assume that the dragon is meant. "Hid" may well
mean here "took while in hiding."

{40b} That is "one and a few others." But Beowulf seems to be
indicated.

{40c} Ten Brink points out the strongly heathen character of this
part of the epic. Beowulf's end came, so the old tradition ran, from
his unwitting interference with spell-bound treasure.

{40d} A hard saying, variously interpreted. In any case, it is the
somewhat clumsy effort of the Christian poet to tone down the
heathenism of his material by an edifying observation.

{41a} Nothing is said of Beowulf's wife in the poem, but Bugge
surmises that Beowulf finally accepted Hygd's offer of kingdom and
hoard, and, as was usual, took her into the bargain.

THE CONFUTATIO PONTIFICIA

By Anonymous

Edited by J. M. Reu.


In Reference To The Matters Presented To His Imperial Majesty By The
Elector Of Saxony And Some Princes And States Of The Holy Roman Empire,
On The Subject And Concerning Causes Pertaining To The Christian
Orthodox Faith, The Following Christian Reply Can Be Given._ August 3,
1530_.




CONFUTATIO PONTIFICIA, AUGUST 3, 1530

As His Worshipful Imperial Majesty received several days since a
Confession of Faith presented by the Elector the duke of Saxony and
several princes and two cities, to which their names were affixed, with
his characteristic zeal for the glory of God, the salvation of souls,
Christian harmony and the public peace, he not only himself read the
Confession, but also, in order that in a matter of such moment he might
proceed the more thoroughly and seasonably, he referred the aforesaid
Confession to several learned, mature, approved and honorable men of
different nations for their inspection and examination, and earnestly
directed and enjoined them to praise and approve what in the Confession
was said aright and in accord with Catholic doctrine, but, on the other
hand, to note that wherein it differed from the Catholic Church, and,
together with their reply, to present and explain their judgment on each
topic. This commission was executed aright and according to order. For
those learned men with all care and diligence examined the aforesaid
Confession, and committed to writing what they thought on each topic,
and thus presented a reply to His Imperial Majesty. This reply His
Worshipful Imperial Majesty, as becomes a Christian emperor, most
accurately read and gave to the other electors, princes and estates
of the Roman Empire for their perusal and examination, which they also
approved as orthodox and in every respect harmonious with the Gospel and
Holy Scripture. For this reason, after a conference with the electors,
princes and states above named, in order that all dissension concerning
this our orthodox holy faith and religion may be removed, His Imperial
Majesty has directed that a declaration be made at present as follows:

In reference to the matters presented to His Imperial Majesty by the
Elector of Saxony and some princes and states of the Holy Roman Empire,
on the subject and concerning causes pertaining to the Christian
orthodox faith, the following Christian reply can be given:




Part I.

To Article I.


Especially when in the first article they confess the unity of the
divine essence in three persons according to the decree of the Council
of Nice, their Confession must be accepted, since it agrees in all
respects with the rule of faith and the Roman Church. For the Council of
Nice, convened under the Emperor Constantine the Great, has always been
regarded inviolable, whereat three hundred and eighteen bishops eminent
and venerable for holiness of life, martyrdom and learning, after
investigating and diligently examining the Holy Scriptures, set forth
this article which they here confess concerning the unity of the essence
and the trinity of persons. So too their condemnation of all heresies
arising contrary to this article must be accepted--viz. the Manichaeans,
Arians, Eunomians, Valentinians, Samosatanes, for the Holy Catholic
Church has condemned these of old.


To Article II.



In the second article we approve their Confession, in common with the
Catholic Church, that the fault of origin is truly sin, condemning and
bringing eternal death upon those who are not born again by baptism and
the Holy Ghost. For in this they properly condemn the Pelagians, both
modern and ancient, who have been long since condemned by the Church.
But the declaration of the article, that Original Sin is that men are
born without the fear of God and without trust in God, is to be entirely
rejected, since it is manifest to every Christian that to be without the
fear of God and without trust in God is rather the actual guilt of an
adult than the offence of a recently-born infant, which does not possess
as yet the full use of reason, as the Lord says "Your children which
had no knowledge between good and evil," Deut 1:39. Moreover, the
declaration is also rejected whereby they call the fault of origin
concupiscence, if they mean thereby that concupiscence is a sin that
remains sin in a child even after baptism. For the Apostolic See has
already condemned two articles of Martin Luther concerning sin remaining
in a child after baptism, and concerning the fomes of sin hindering
a soul from entering the kingdom of heaven. But if, according to the
opinion of St Augustine, they call the vice of origin concupiscence,
which in baptism ceases to be sin, this ought to be accepted, since
indeed according to the declaration of St. Paul, we are all born
children of wrath (Eph. 2:3), and in Adam we all have sinned (Rom.5:12).


To Article III.


In the third article there is nothing to offend, since the entire
Confession agrees with the Apostles' Creed and the right rule of
faith--viz. the Son of God became incarnate, assumed human nature into
the unity of his person, was born of the Virgin Mary, truly suffered
was crucified, died, descended to hell, rose again on the third day,
ascended to heaven, and sat down at the right hand of the Father.


To Article IV

In the fourth article the condemnation of the Pelagians, who thought
that man can merit eternal life by his own powers without the grace
of God, is accepted as Catholic and in accordance with the ancient
councils, for the Holy Scriptures expressly testify to this. John the
Baptist says: "A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from
heaven," John 3:27 "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from
above, and comes down from the Father of lights," James 1:17. Therefore
"our sufficiency is of God," 2 Cor 3:5. And Christ says: "No man can
come to me, Except the Father, which hath sent me, draw him," John 6:44
And Paul: "What hast thou that thou didst not receive?" I Cor 4:7. For
if any one should intend to disapprove of the merits that men acquire
by the assistance of divine grace, he would agree with the Manichaeans
rather than with the Catholic Church. For it is entirely contrary to
holy Scripture to deny that our works are meritorious. For St. Paul says
"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept
the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day," 2 Tim.
4:7 & 8. And to the Corinthians he wrote "We must all appear before the
judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in
his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,"
2 Cor. 5:10. For where there are wages there is merit. The Lord said
to Abraham: "Fear not, Abraham, I am thy shield and thy exceeding great
reward," Gen 15:l. And Isaiah says: "Behold, his reward is with him, and
his work before him," Isa. 40:10; and, chapter 58:7, 8: "Deal they bread
to the hungry, and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of
the Lord shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall gather thee
up." So too the Lord to Cain: "If thou doest well shalt thou not be
accepted?" Gen. 4:7. So the parable in the Gospel declares that we have
been hired for the Lord's vineyard, who agrees with us for a penny a
day, and says: "Call the laborers and give them their hire," Matt 20:8.
So Paul, knowing the mysteries of God, says: "Every man shall
receive his own reward, according to his own labor," I Cor. 3:8. 6.
Nevertheless, all Catholics confess that our works of themselves have no
merit, but that God's grace makes them worthy of eternal life. Thus St.
John says: "They shall walk with me in white; for they are worthy," Rev.
3:4. And St Paul says to the Colossians, 1:12: "Giving thanks unto the
Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of
the saints in light."


To Article V.

In the fifth article the statement that the Holy Ghost is given by the
Word and sacraments, as by instruments, is approved. For thus it is
written, Acts 10:44: "While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost
fell on all them which heard the word." And John 1:33: "The same is He
which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost." The mention, however, that they
here make of faith is approved so far as not Faith alone, which some
incorrectly teach, but faith which worketh by love, is understood,
as the apostle teaches aright in Gal 5:3. For in baptism there is an
infusion, not of faith alone, but also, at the same time, of hope and
love, as Pope Alexander declares in the canon Majores concerning baptism
and its effect; which John the Baptist also taught long before, saying,
Luke 3:16: "He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire."


To Article VI.


Their Confession in the sixth article that faith should bring forth
good fruits is acceptable and valid since "faith without works is dead,"
James 2:17, and all Scripture invites us to works. For the wise man
says: "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might." Eccles.
9:10. "And the Lord had respect to Abel and to his offering," Gen. 4:4.
He saw that Abraham would "command his Children and his household after
him to keep the way of the Lord, and to do justice and judgment," Gen.
18:19. And: "By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou
hast done this thing I will bless thee and multiply thy seed." Gen
22:16. Thus he regarded the fast of the Ninevites, Jonah 3, and the
lamentations and tears of King Hezekiah, 4:2; 2 Kings 20. For this
cause all the faithful should follow the advice of St. Paul: "As we have
therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto
them who are of the household of faith," Gal. 6:10. For Christ says:
"The night cometh when no man can work." John 9:4. But in the same article
their ascription of justification to faith alone is diametrically
opposite the truth of the Gospel by which works are not excluded;
"because glory, honor and peace to every man that worketh good," Rom.
2:10. Why? because David, Ps. 62:12; Christ, Matt. 16:27; and Paul, Rom.
2:6 testify that God will render to every one according to his works.
Besides Christ says: "Not every one that saith unto me Lord, Lord shall
enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my
Father," Matt. 7:21. 4. Hence however much one may believe, if he work
not what is good, he is not a friend of God. "Ye are my friends," says
Christ, "if ye do whatsoever I command you," John 15:14. On this account
their frequent ascription of justification to faith is not admitted
since it pertains to grace and love. For St. Paul says: "Though I have
all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity, I am
nothing." 1 Cor. 13:2. Here St. Paul certifies to the princes and the
entire Church that faith alone does not justify. Accordingly he teaches
that love is the chief virtue, Col. 3:14: "Above all these things put on
charity, which is the bond of perfectness." Neither are they supported
by the word of Christ: "When ye shall have done all these things, say
We are unprofitable servants," Luke 17:10. For if the doors ought to
be called unprofitable, how much more fitting is it to say to those
who only believe, When ye shall have believed all things say, We are
unprofitable servants! This word of Christ, therefore, does not extol
faith without works, but teaches that our works bring no profit to God;
that no one can be puffed up by our works; that, when contrasted with
the divine reward, our works are of no account and nothing. Thus St.
Paul says: "I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us," Rom.
8:18. For faith and good works are gifts of God, whereby, through God's
mercy, eternal life is given. So, too, the citation at this point from
Ambrose is in no way pertinent, since St. Ambrose is here expressed
declaring his opinion concerning legal works. For he says: "Without the
law," but, "Without the law of the Sabbath, and of circumcision, and of
revenge." And this he declares the more clearly on Rom. 4, citing St.
James concerning the justification of Abraham without legal works before
circumcision. For how could Ambrose speak differently in his comments
from St. Paul in the text when he says: "Therefore by the deeds of the
law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight?" Therefore, finally,
he does not exclude faith absolutely, but says: "We conclude that a man
is justified by faith without the deeds of the law."


To Article VII.

The seventh article of the Confession, wherein it is affirmed that
the Church is the congregation of saints, cannot be admitted without
prejudice to faith if by this definition the wicked and sinners be
separated from the Church. For in the Council of Constance this article
was condemned among the articles of John Huss of cursed memory, and it
plainly contradicts the Gospel. For there we read that John the Baptist
compared the Church to a threshing-floor, which Christ will cleanse with
his fan, and will gather the wheat into his garner, but will burn the
chaff with unquenchable fire, Matt. 3:12. Wherefore this article of
the Confession is in no way accepted, although we read in it their
confession that the Church is perpetual, since here the promise of
Christ has its place, who promises that the Spirit of truth will abide
with it forever John 14:16. And Christ himself promises that he will be
with the church alway unto the end of the world. They are praised also,
in that they do not regard variety of rites as separating unity of
faith, if they speak of special rites. For to this effect Jerome says:
"Every province abounds in its own sense" (of propriety). But if they
extend this part of the Confession to universal Church rites, tis also
must be utterly rejected, and we must say with St. Paul: "We have no
such custom," 1 Cor. 11:16. "For by all believers universal rites must
be observed," St. Augustine, whose testimony they also use, well taught
of Januarius; for we must presume that such rites were transmitted from
the apostles.


To Article VIII.

The eighth article of the Confession, concerning wicked ministers of the
Church and hypocrites--viz. that their wickedness does not injure the
sacraments and the Word--is accepted with the Holy Roman Church, and
the princes commend it, condemning on this topic the Donatists and
the ancient Origenists, who maintained that it was unlawful to use the
ministry of the wicked in the Church--a heresy which the Waldenses and
Poor of Lyons revived. Afterwards John Wicliff in England and John Huss
in Bohemia adopted this.


To Article IX.

The ninth article, concerning Baptism--viz. that it is necessary to
salvation, and that children ought to be baptized--is approved and
accepted, and they are right in condemning the Anabaptists, a most
seditious class of men that ought to be banished far from the boundaries
of the Roman Empire in order that illustrious Germany may not suffer
again such a destructive and sanguinary commotion as she experienced
five tears ago in the slaughter of so many thousands.



To Article X.


The tenth article gives no offense in its words, because they confess
that in the Eucharist, after the consecration lawfully made, the Body
and Blood of Christ are substantially and truly present, if only they
believe that the entire Christ is present under each form, so that
the Blood of Christ is no less present under the form of bread by
concomitance than it is under the form of the wine, and the reverse.
Otherwise, in the Eucharist the Body of Christ is dead and bloodless,
contrary to St. Paul, because "Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth
no more," Rom. 6:9. One matter is added as very necessary to the article
of the Confession--viz. that they believe the Church, rather than some
teaching otherwise and incorrectly, that by the almighty Word of God in
the consecration of the Eucharist the substance of the bread is changed
into the Body of Christ. For thus in a general council it has been
determined, canon Firmiter, concerning the exalted Trinity, and
the Catholic faith. They are praised therefor, for condemning the
Capernaites, who deny the truth of the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus
Christ in the Eucharist.


To Article XI.


The eleventh article their acknowledgment that private absolution with
confession should be retained in the Church is accepted as catholic and
in harmony with our faith, because absolution is supported by the word
of Christ. For Christ says to his apostles, John 20:23: "Whosoever sins
ye remit, they are remitted unto them." Nevertheless, two things must
here be required of them: one, that they compel an annual confession
to be observed by their subjects, according to the constitution, canon
Omnis Utriusque, concerning penance and remission and the custom of the
Church universal. Another that through their preachers they cause their
subjects to be faithfully admonished when they are about to confess that
although they cannot state all their sins individually, nevertheless, a
diligent examination of their conscience being made, they make an entire
confession of their offences--viz. of all which occur to their memory in
such investigation. But in regard to the rest that have been forgotten
and have escaped our mind it is lawful to make a general confession,
and to say with the Psalmist, Ps. 19:17: "Cleanse me, Lord, from secret
faults."


To Article XII.


In the twelfth article their confession that such as have fallen may
find remission of sins at the time when they are converted, and that
the Church should give absolution unto such as return to repentance, is
commended, since they most justly condemn the Novatians who deny that
repentance can be repeated, in opposition both to the prophet who
promises grace to the sinner at whatever hour he shall mourn, Ezek.
18:21, and the merciful declaration of Christ our Saviour, replying to
St. Peter, that not until seven times, but until seventy times seven in
one day, he should forgive his brother sinning against him, Matt. 18:22.
But the second part of this article is utterly rejected. For when they
ascribe only two parts to repentance, they antagonize the entire Church,
which from the time of the apostles has held and believed that there are
three parts of repentance--contrition, confession and satisfaction. Thus
the ancient doctors, Origen, Cyprian, Chrysostom, Gregory, Augustine,
taught in attestation of the Holy Scriptures, especially from 2 Kings
12, concerning David, 2 Chron 3:1, concerning Manasseh, Ps. 31, 37, 50,
101, etc. Therefore Pope Leo X of happy memory justly condemned
this article of Luther, who taught: "That there are three parts of
repentance--viz. confession, contrition, and satisfaction--has no
foundation in Scripture or in Holy Christian doctors." This part of the
article, therefore can in no way be admitted; so, too, neither can that
which asserts that faith is the second part of repentance, since it is
known to all that faith precedes repentance; for unless one believes
he will not repent. Neither is that part admitted which makes light of
pontifical satisfactions, for it is contrary to the Gospel, contrary
to the apostles, contrary to the fathers, contrary to the councils,
and contrary to the universal Catholic Church. John the Baptist cries:
"Bring forth fruits meet for repentance," Matt. 3:8. St. Paul teaches:
"As ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness, even so now
yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness," Rom 6:19.
He likewise preached to the Gentiles that they should repent and be
Converted to God, bringing forth fruits meet for repentance, Acts 20:21.
So Christ himself also began to teach and preach repentance: "Repent,
for the kingdom of heaven is at hand," Matt. 4:17. Afterward he
commanded the apostles to pursue this mode of preaching and teaching,
Luke 24:47, and St. Peter faithfully obeyed him in his first sermon,
Acts 2:38. So Augustine also exhorts that "every one exercise toward
himself severity, so that, being judged of himself, he shall not be
judged of the Lord," as St. Paul says. 1 Cor. 11:31. Pope Leo surnamed
the Great, said "The Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
gave to those set over the churches the authority to assign to those who
confess the doing of penance, and through the door of reconciliation to
admit to the communion of the sacraments those who have been cleansed by
a salutary satisfaction." Brose says: "The amount of the penance must
be adapted to the trouble of the conscience." Hence divere penitential
canons were appointed in the holy Synod of Nice, in accordance with The
diversity of satisfactions, Jovinian the heretic, thought, however,
that all sins are equal and accordingly did not admit a diversity of
satisfactions. Moreover, satisfactions should not be abolished in the
Church, contrary to the express Gospel and the decrees of councils and
fathers, but those absolved by the priest ought to perform the penance
enjoined, following the declaration of St. Paul: He "gave himself for
us, to redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar
people, zealous of good works," Tit. 2:14. Christ thus made satisfaction
for us, that we might be zealous of good works, fulfilling the
satisfaction enjoined.


To Article XIII.


The thirteenth article gives no offence, but is accepted, while they say
that the sacraments were instituted not only to be marks of profession
among men, but rather to be signs and testimonies of God's will toward
us; nevertheless, we must request them that what they here ascribe to
the sacraments in general they confess also specifically concerning the
seven sacraments of the Church and take measures for the observance of
them by their subjects.


To Article XIV.

When, in the fourteenth article, they confess that no one ought to
administer in the Church the Word of God and the sacraments unless he be
rightly called, it ought to be understood that he is rightly called
who is called in accordance with the form of law and the ecclesiastical
ordinances and decrees hitherto observed everywhere in the Christian
world, and not according to a Jeroboitic (cf. 1 Kings 12:20) call, or
a tumult or any other irregular intrusion of the people. Aaron was
not thus called. Therefore in this sense the Confession is received;
nevertheless, they should be admonished to persevere therein, and to
admit in their realms no one either as pastor or as preacher unless he
be rightly called.


To Article XV.


In the fifteenth article their confession that such ecclesiastical rites
are to be observed as may be observed without sin, and are profitable
for tranquility and good order in the Church, is accepted, and they
must be admonished that the princes and cities see to it that the
ecclesiastical rites of the Church universal be observed in their
dominions and districts, as well as those which have been kept devoutly
and religiously in every province even to us, and if any of these have
been intermitted that they restore them, and arrange, determine and
effectually enjoin upon their subjects that all things be done in their
churches according to the ancient form. Nevertheless, the appendix to
this article must be entirely removed, since it is false that human
ordinances instituted to propitiate God and make satisfactions for sins
are opposed to the Gospel, as will be more amply declared hereafter
concerning vows, the choice of food and the like.


To Article XVI.

The sixteenth article, concerning civil magistrates, is received with
pleasure, as in harmony not only with civil law, but also with canonical
law, the Gospel, the Holy Scriptures, and the universal norm of faith,
since the apostle enjoins that "every soul be subject unto the higher
powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are
ordained of God. Whosoever, therefore, resisteth the power, resisteth
the ordinance of God, and they that resist shall receive to themselves
damnation," Rom. 13:1. And the princes are praised for condemning the
Anabaptists, who overthrow all civil ordinances and prohibit Christians
the use of the magistracy and other civil offices, without which no
state is successfully administered.


To Article XVII.

The confession of the seventeenth article is received, since from the
Apostles' Creed and the Holy Scripture the entire Catholic Church knows
that Christ will come at the last day to judge the quick and the dead.
Therefore they justly condemn here the Anabaptists, who think there
will be an end of punishments to condemned men and devils, and imagine
certain Jewish kingdoms of the godly, before the resurrection of the
dead, in this present world, the wicked being everywhere suppressed.


To Article XVIII.

In the eighteenth article they confess the power of the Free Will--viz.
that it has the power to work a civil righteousness, but that it has
not, without the Holy Ghost, the virtue to work the righteousness of
God. This confession is received and approved. For it thus becomes
Catholics to pursue the middle way, so as not, with the Pelagians, to
ascribe too much to the free will, nor, with the godless Manichaeans,
to deny it all liberty; for both are not without fault. Thus Augustine
says: "With sure faith we believe, and without doubt we preach, that
a free will exists in men. For it is an inhuman error to deny the free
will in man, which every one experiences in himself, and is so often
asserted in the Holy Scriptures." St. Paul says: "Having power over his
own will." 1 Cor. 7:37. Of the righteous the wise man says: "Who might
offend, and hath not offended? or done evil, and hath not done it?"
Eccles. 31:10. God said to Cain: "If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto
thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him," Gen. 4:7.
Through the prophet Isaiah he says: "If ye be willing and obedient ye
shall eat the good of the land. But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall
be devoured with the sword." This also Jeremiah has briefly expressed:
"Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil, as thou couldest," Jer. 3:5.
We add also Ezek. 18:31ff.: "Cast away from you all your transgressions
whereby ye have transgressed; and make ye a new heart, and a new spirit;
for why will ye die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the
death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God; wherefore turn yourselves
and live." Also St. Paul: "The spirits of the prophets are subject to
the prophets," 1 Cor. 14:32. Likewise 2 Cor. 9:7: "Every man according
as he purposeth in his heart; not grudgingly or of necessity." finally,
Christ overthrew all the Manichaeans with one word when he said: "Ye
have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them
good." Mark 14:7; and to Jerusalem Christ says: "How often would I have
gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathered her chickens
under her wings, and ye would not!" Matt. 23:37.


To Article XIX.

The nineteenth article is likewise approved and accepted. For God,
the supremely good, is not the author of evils, but the rational and
defectible will is the cause of sin; wherefore let no one impute his
midsdeeds and crimes to God, but to himself, according to Jer. 2:19:
"Thine own wickedness shall correct thee and thy backslidings shall
reprove thee;" and Hos. 13:9: "O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself;
but in me is thy help." And David in the spirit acknowledged that God is
not one that hath pleasure in wickedness, Ps. 5:4.


To Article XX.

In the twentieth article, which does not contain so much the confession
of the princes and cities as the defense of the preachers, there is only
one thing that pertains to the princes and cities--viz. concerning good
works, that they do not merit the remission of sins, which, as it has
been rejected and disapproved before, is also rejected and disapproved
now. For the passage in Daniel is very familiar: "Redeem thy sins with
alms," Dan. 4:24; and the address of Tobit to his son: "Alms do deliver
from death and suffereth not to come into darkness," Tobit 4:10; and
that of Christ: "Give alms of such things as ye have, and behold all
things are clean unto you," Luke 11:41. If works were not meritorious
why would the wise man say: "God will render a reward of the labors of
his saints"? Wisd. 10:17. Why would St. Peter so earnestly exhort to
good works, saying: "Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence by
good works to make your calling and election sure"? 2 Pet. 1:19. Why
would St. Paul have said: "God is not unrighteous to forget your work
and labor of love, which ye have showed towards his name"? Heb. 6:10.
Nor by this do we reject Christ's merit but we know that our works are
nothing and of no merit unless by virtue of Christ's passion. We know
that Christ is "the way, the truth and the life,". John 14:6. But
Christ, as the Good Shepherd, who "began to do and teach," Acts 1:1, has
given us an example that as he has done we also should do, John 13:15.
He also went through the desert by the way of good works, which all
Christians ought to pursue, and according to his command bear the cross
and follow him. Matt. 10:38; 16:24. He who bears not the cross, neither
is nor can be Christ's disciple. That also is true which John says: "He
that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he
walked," 1 John 2:6. Moreover, this opinion concerning good works was
condemned and rejected more than a thousand years ago in the time of
Augustine.


To Article XXI.

In the last place, they present the twenty-first article, wherein they
admit that the memory of saints may be set before us, that we may follow
their faith and good works, but not that they be invoked and aid be
sought of them. It is certainly wonderful that the princes especially
and the cities have allowed this error to be agitated in their
dominions, which has been condemned so often before in the Church, since
eleven hundred years ago St. Jerome vanquished in this area the heretic
Vigilantius. Long after him arose the Albigenses, the Poor Men of
Lyons, the Picards, the Cathari old and new: all of whom were condemned
legitimately long ago. Wherefore this article of the Confession, so
frequently condemned, must be utterly rejected and in harmony with the
entire universal Church be condemned; for in favor of the invocation of
saints we have not only the authority of the Church universal but also
the agreement of the holy fathers, Augustine, Bernard, Jerome, Cyprian,
Chrysostom, Basil, and this class of other Church teachers. Neither is
the authority of Holy Scripture absent from this Catholic assertion, for
Christ taught that the saints should be honored: "If any man serve me,
him will my Father honor," John 12:26. If, therefore, God honors saints,
why do not we, insignificant men, honor them? Besides, the Lord was
turned to repentance by Job when he prayed for his friends, Job 42:8.
Why, therefore, would not God, the most pious, who gave assent to Job,
do the same to the Blessed Virgin when she intercedes? We read also in
Baruch 3:4: "O Lord Almighty, thou God of Israel, hear now the prayers
of the dead Israelites." Therefore the dead also pray for us. Thus did
Onias and Jeremiah in the Old Testament. For Onias the high priest was
seen by Judas Maccabaeus holding up his hands and praying for the whole
body of the Jews. Afterwards another man appeared, remarkable both for
his age and majesty, and of great beauty about him, concerning whom
Onias replied: "This is a love of the brethren and of the people Israel,
who prayeth much for the people and for the Holy city--to wit,
Jeremiah the prophet." 2 Macc. 15:12-14. Besides, we know from the Holy
Scriptures that the angels pray for us. Why, then, would we deny this of
the saints? "O Lord of hosts," said the angels, "how long wilt thou not
have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou
hast had indignation? And the Lord answered the angel that talked with
me comfortable words." Zech. 1:12, 13. Job likewise testifies: "If there
be an angel with him speaking, one among a thousand, to show unto man
his uprightness, he will pity him and say, Deliver him from going down
to the pit." Job 33:23, 24. This is clear besides from the words of that
holy soul, John the Evangelist, when he says: "The four beasts and the
four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having each one of
them harps and golden vials, full of odors which are the prayers of
saints," Rev. 5:8; and afterwards: "An angel stood at the altar, having
a golden censer, and there was given unto him much incense, that he
should offer it with the prayers of al saints upon the golden altar
which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense, which came
up with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the
angel's hand." Lastly, St. Cyprian the martyr more than twelve hundred
and fifty years ago wrote to Pope Cornelius, Book I, Letter 1, asking
that "if any depart first, his prayer for our brethren and sisters may
not cease." For if this holy man had not ascertained that after this
life the saints pray for the living, he would have given exhortation to
no purpose. Neither is their Confession strengthened by the fact that
there is one Mediator between God and men, 1 Tim. 2:5; 1 John 2:1. For
although His Imperial Majesty, with the entire Church, confesses that
there is one Mediator of redemption, nevertheless the mediators of
intercession are many. Thus Moses was both mediator and agent between
God and men, Deut. 5:31, for he prayed for the children of Israel, Ex.
17:11; 32:11f. Thus St. Paul prayed for those with whom he was sailing,
Acts 27; so, too, he asked that he be prayed for by the Romans, Rom.
15:30, by the Corinthians, 2 Cor. 1:11, and by the Colossians, Col. 4:3.
So while Peter was kept in prison prayer was made without ceasing of
the Church unto God for him, Acts 12:5. Christ, therefore, is our chief
Advocate, and indeed the greatest; but since the saints are members of
Christ, 1 Cor. 12:27 and Eph. 5:30, and conform their will to that of
Christ, and see that their Head, Christ, prays for us, who can doubt
that the saints do the very same thing which they see Christ doing? With
all these things carefully considered, we must ask the princes and the
cities adhering to them that they reject this part of the Confession
and agree with the holy universal and orthodox Church and believe and
confess, concerning the worship and intercession of saints, what the
entire Christian world believes and confesses, and was observed in all
the churches in the time of Augustine. "A Christian people." he says,
"celebrates the memories of martyrs with religious observance, that it
share in their merits and be aided by their prayers."



Part II

Reply to the Second Part of the Confession.


Of Lay Communion under One Form. As in the Confessions of the princes
and cities they enumerate among the abuses that laymen commune only
under one form, and as, therefore, in their dominions both forms are
administered to laymen, we must reply, according to the custom of the
Holy Church, that this is incorrectly enumerated among the abuses, but
that, according to the sanctions and statutes of the same Church it is
rather an abuse and disobedience to administer to laymen both forms. For
under the one form of bread the saints communed in the primitive Church,
of whom Luke says: "They continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine
and fellowship, and in breaking of bread." Acts 2:42. Here Luke mentions
bread alone. Likewise Acts 20:7 says: "Upon the first day of the week,
when the disciples came together to break bread." Yea, Christ, the
institutor of this most holy sacrament, rising again from the dead,
administered the Eucharist only under one form to the disciples going to
Emmaus, where he took bread and blessed it, and brake and gave to them,
and they recognized him in the breaking of bread. Luke 24:30, 31: where
indeed Augustine, Chrysostome, Theophylact and Bede some of whom many
ags ago and not long after the times of the apostles affirm that it
was the Eucharist. Christ also (John 6) very frequently mentions bread
alone. St. Ignatius, a disciple of St. John the Evangelist, in his
Epistle to the Ephesians mentions the bread alone in the communion
of the Eucharist. Ambrose does likewise in his books concerning the
sacraments, speaking of the communion of Laymen. In the Council of
Rheims, laymen were forbidden from bearing the sacrament of the Body to
the sick, and no mention is there made of the form of wine. Hence it is
understood that the viaticum was given the sick under only one form. The
ancient penitential canons approve of this. For the Council of Agde put
a guilty priest into a monastery and granted him only lay communion. In
the Council of Sardica, Hosius prohibits certain indiscreet persons
from receiving even lay communion, unless they finally repent. There has
always been a distinction in the Church between lay communion under
one form and priestly communion under both forms. This was beautifully
predicted in the Old Testament concerning the descendants of Eli: "It
shall come to pass," says God, 1 Kings 2; 1 Sam. 2:36, "that everyone
that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of
silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, 'Put me, I pray thee,
into one of the priests' office' (Vulgate reads: "Ad unam partem
sacerdotalem."), 'that I may eat a piece of bread.'" Here Holy Scripture
clearly shows that the posterity of Eli, when removed from the office
of the priesthood, will seek to be admitted to one sacerdotal part, to a
piece of bread. So our laymen also ought, therefore, to be content
with one sacerdotal part, the one form. For both the Roman pontiffs
and cardinals and all bishops and priests, save in the mass and in the
extreme hour of life for a viaticum, as it is called in the Council of
Nice, re content with taking one form, which they would not do if they
thought that both forms would be necessary for salvation. Although,
however, both forms were of old administered in many churches to laymen
(for then it was free to commune under one or under both forms), yet
on account of many dangers the custom of administering both forms has
ceased. For when the multitude of the people is considered where there
are old and young, tremulous and weak and inept, if great care be not
employed and injury is done the Sacrament by the spilling of the liquid.
Because of the great multitude there would be difficulty also in giving
the chalice cautiously for the form of wine, which also when kept for
a long time would sour and cause nausea or vomition to those who would
receive it; neither could it be readily taken to the sick without danger
of spilling. For these reasons and others the churches in which the
custom had been to give both forms to laymen were induced, undoubtedly
by impulse of the Holy Ghost, to give thereafter but one form, from the
consideration chiefly that the entire Christ is under each form, and
is received no less under one form than under two. In the Council of
Constance, of such honorable renown, a decree to this effect appeared,
and so too the Synod of Basle legitimately decreed. And although it
was formerly a matter of freedom to use either one or both forms in the
Eucharist, nevertheless, when the heresy arose which taught that both
forms were necessary, the Holy Church, which is directed by the Holy
Ghost, forbade both forms to laymen. For thus the Church is sometimes
wont to extinguish heresies by contrary institutions; as when some
arose who maintained that the Eucharist is properly celebrated only when
unleavened bread is used, the Church for a while commanded that it be
administered with leavened bread; and when Nestorius wished to establish
that the perpetual Virgin Mary was mother only of Christ, not of God,
the Church for a time forbade her to be called Christotokos, mother of
Christ. Wherefore we must entreat the princes and cities not to permit
this schism to be introduced into Germany, into the Roman Empire, or
themselves to be separated from the custom of the Church Universal.
Neither do the arguments adduced in this article avail, for while Christ
indeed instituted both forms of the Sacrament, yet it is nowhere found
in the Gospel that he enjoined that both forms be received by the laity.
For what is said in Matt. 26:27: "Drink ye all of it," was said to the
twelve apostles, who were priests, as is manifest from Mark 14:23, where
it is said: "And they all drank of it." This certainly was not fulfilled
hitherto with respect to laymen; whence the custom never existed
throughout the entire Church that both forms were given to laymen,
although it existed perhaps among the Corinthians and Carthaginians
and some other Churches. As to their reference to Gelasius, Canon
Comperimus, of Consecration. Dist. 2, if they examine the document they
will find that Gelasius speaks of priests, and not of laymen. Hence
their declaration that the custom of administering but one form is
contrary to divine law must be rejected. But most of all the appendix
to the article must be rejected, that the procession with the Eucharist
must be neglected or omitted, because the sacrament is thus divided. For
they themselves know, or at least ought to know, that by the Christian
faith Christ has not been divided, but that the entire Christ is under
both forms, and that the Gospel nowhere forbids the division of the
sacramental forms; as is done on Parasceve (Holy or Maundy Thursday) by
the entire Church of the Catholics, although the consecration is made
by the celebrant in both forms, who also ought to receive both. Therefore
the princes and cities should be admonished to pay customary reverence
and due honor to Christ the Son of the living God, our Savior and
Glorifier, the Lord of heaven and earth, since they believe and
acknowledge that he is truly present--a matter which they know has been
most religiously observed by their ancestors, most Christian princes.


II. Of the Marriage of Priests.

Their enumeration among abuses, in the second place, of the celibacy
of the clergy, and the manner in which their priests marry and persuade
others to marry, are verily matters worthy of astonishment, since they
call sacerdotal celibacy an abuse, when that which is directly contrary,
the violation of celibacy and the illicit transition to marriage,
deserves to be called the worst abuse in priests. For that priests ought
never to marry Aurelius testifys in the second Council of Carthage,
where he says: "Because the apostles taught thus by example, and
antiquity itself has preserved it, let us also maintain it." And a
little before a canon to this effect is read: "Resolved, That the
bishops, presbyters and deacons, or those who administer the sacraments,
abstain, as guardians of chastity, from wives." From these words it is
clear that this tradition has been received from the apostles, and not
recently devised by the Church. Augustine, following Aurelius in the
last question concerning the Old and New Testaments, writes upon these
words, and asks: "If perhaps it be said, if it is lawful and good to
marry, why are not priests permitted to have wives?" Pope Caliztus, a
holy man and a martyr, decided thirteen hundred years ago that priest
should not marry. The like is read also in the holy Councils of
Caesarea, Neocaesarea, Africa, Agde, Gironne, Meaux, and Orleans.
Thus the custom has been observed from the time of the Gospel and the
apostles that one who has been put into the office of priests has never
been permitted, according to law, to marry. It is indeed true that on
account of lack of ministers of God in the primitive Church married men
were admitted to the priesthood, as is clear from the Apostolic Canons
and the reply of Paphnutius in the Council of Nice; nevertheless, those
who wished to contract marriage were compelled to do so before receiving
the subdiaconate, as we read in the canon Si quis corum Dist. 32.
This custom of the primitive Church the Greek Church has preserved and
retained to this day. But when, by the grace of God, the Church has
increased so that there was no lack of ministers in the Church, Pope
Siricius, eleven hundred and forty years ago, undoubtedly not without
the Holy Ghost, enjoined absolute continence upon the priests, Canon
Plurimus, Dist. 82--an injunction which Popes Innocent I., Leo the Great
and Gregory the Great approved and ratified, and which the Latin Church
has everywhere observed to this day. From these facts it is regarded
sufficiently clear that the celibacy of the clergy is not an abuse, and
that it was approved by fathers so holy at such a remote time, and was
received by the entire Latin Church. Besides, the priests of the old
law, as in the case of Zacharias, were separated from their wives at
times when they discharged their office and ministered in the temple.
But since the priest of the new law ought always to be engaged in the
ministry, it follows that he ought always to be continent. Furthermore,
married persons should not defraud one the other of conjugal duties
except for a time that they may give themselves to prayer. 1 Cor.
75. But since a priest ought always to pray, he ought always to be
continent. Besides, St. Paul says: "But I would have you without
carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to
the Lord, that he may please the Lord. But he that is married careth for
the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife," 1 Cor.
7:32, 33. Therefore let the priest who should please God continually
flee from anxiety for a wife, and not look back with Lot's wife, Gen.
19:26. Moreover, sacerdotal continence was foreshadowed also in the Old
Testament, for Moses commanded those who were to receive the law not
to approach their wives until the third day, Ex 19:15. Much less,
therefore, should the priests, who are about to receive Christ as our
Legislator, Lord and Savior, approach wives. Priests were commanded
likewise to wear linen thigh-bandages, to cover the shame of the flesh
(Ex. 28:42); which, says Beda, was a symbol of future continence among
priests. Also, when Ahimelech was about to give the blessed bread to the
servants of David he asked first if they had kept themselves from women
and David replied that they had for three days. 1 Kings 21 (1 Sam.
21:4, 5). Therefore, they who take the living Bread which came down from
heaven, John 6:32ff., should always be pure with respect to them. They
who ate the Passover had their loins girded, Ex. 12:11. Wherefore the
priests, who frequently eat Christ our Passover, ought to gird their
loins by continence and cleanliness, as the Lord commands them: "Be ye
clean," he says, "that bear the vessels of the Lord," Isa. 52:11. "Ye
shall be holy, for I am holy," Lev. 19:2. Therefore let priests serve
God "in holiness and righteousness all their days." Luke 1:75. Hence the
holy martyr Cyprian testifies that it was revealed to him by the Lord,
and he was most solemnly enjoined, to earnestly admonish the clergy
not to occupy a domicile in common with women. Hence, since sacerdotal
continence has been commanded by the pontiffs and revealed by God
and promised to God, by the priest in a special vow, it must not be
rejected. For this is required by the excellency of the sacrifice they
offer, the frequency of prayer, and liberty and purity of spirit, that
they care how to please God, according to the teaching of St. Paul. And
because this is manifestly the ancient heresy of Jovinian, which the
Roman Church condemned and Jerome refuted in his writings, and St.
Augustine said that this heresy was immediately extinguished and did not
attain to the corruption and abuse of priests, the princes ought not to
tolerate it to the perpetual shame and disgrace of the Roman Empire,
but should rather conform themselves to the Church universal, and not be
influenced by those things which are suggested to them. For as to what
Paul says, 1 Cor. 7:2: "To avoid fornication, let every man have his own
wife," Jerome replies that St. Paul is speaking of one who has not made
a vow, as Athanasius and Vulgarius understand the declaration of St.
Paul: "If a virgin marry, she hath not sinned." (1 Cor. 7:28), that here
a virgin is meant who has not been consecrated to God. So in reference
to: "It is better to marry than to burn" (1 Cor. 7:9), the pointed reply
of Jerome against Jovinian is extant. For the same St. Paul says (1 Cor.
7:1): "It is good for a man not to touch a woman." For a priest has
the intermediate position of neither marrying nor burning, but of
restraining himself by the grace of God, which he obtains of God by
devout prayer and chastising of the flesh, by fasting and vigils.
Furthermore, when they say that Christ taught that all men are not fit
for celibacy, it is indeed true, and on this account not all are fit for
the priesthood; but let the priest pray, and he will be ble to receive
Christ's word concerning continence, as St. Paul says: "I can do
all things through Christ which strengtheneth me," Phil. 4:13. For
continence is a gift of God, Wisd. 8:21. Besides, when they allege
that this is God's ordinance and command, Gen. 1:28, Jerome replied
concerning these words a thousand years ago: "It was necessary first to
plant the forest, and that it grow, in order that that might be which
could afterwards be cut down." Then the command was given concerning
the procreation of offspring, that the earth should be replenished, but
since it has been replenished so that there is a pressure of nations,
the commandment does not pertain in like manner upon those able to be
continent. In vain, too, do they boast of God's express order. Let them
show, if they can, where God has enjoined priests to marry. Besides, we
find in the divine law that vows once offered should be paid, Ps. 49 and
75; Eccles. 5, Ps. 50:14, 76:11; Eccles. 5:4. Why, therefore, do they
not observe this express divine law? They also pervert St. Paul, as
though he teaches that one who is to be chosen bishop should be married
when he says: "Let a bishop be the husband of one wife;" which is not
to be understood as though he ought to be married, for then Martin,
Nicolaus, Titus, John the Evangelist, yea Christ, would not have been
bishops. Hence Jerome explains the words of St. Paul, "that a bishop
be the husband of one wife," as meaning that he be not a bigamist.
The truth of this exposition is clear, not only from the authority of
Jerome, which ought to be great with every Catholic, but also from St.
Paul, who writes concerning the selection of widows: "Let not a widow be
taken into the number under three score years, having been the wife of
one man," 1 Tim. 5:9. Lastly, the citation of what was done among the
Germans is the statement of a fact, but not of a law, for while there was
a contention between the Emperor Henry IV, and the Roman Pontiff, and
also between his son and the nobles of the Empire, both divine and
human laws were equally confused, so that at the time the laity rashly
attempted to administer sacred things, to use filth instead of holy oil,
to baptize, and to do much else foreign to the Christian religion. The
clergy likewise went beyond their sphere--a precedent which cannot be
cited as law. Neither was it regarded unjust to dissolve sacrilegious
marriages which had been contracted to no effect in opposition to vows
and the sanction of fathers and councils; as even today the marriages of
priests with their so-called wives are not valid. In vain, therefore,
do they complain that the world is growing old, and that as a remedy for
infirmity rigor should be relaxed, for those who are consecrated to God
have other remedies of infirmities; as, for instance, let them avoid
the society of women, shun idleness, macerate the flesh by fasting and
vigils, keep the outward senses, especially sight and hearing, from
things forbidden, turn away their eyes from beholding vanity, and
finally dash their little ones--i.e. their carnal thoughts--upon a rock
(and Christ is the Rock), suppress their passions, and frequently
and devoutly resort to God in prayer. These are undoubtedly the most
effectual remedies for incontinence in ecclesiastics and servants of
God. St. Paul said aright that the doctrine of those who forbid marriage
is a doctrine of demons. Such was the doctrine of Tatian and Marcoin,
whom Augustine and Jerome have mentioned. But the Church does not
thus forbid marriage, as she even enumerates marriage among the seven
sacraments; with which, however, it is consistent that on account of
their superior ministry she should enjoin upon ecclesiastics superior
purity. For it is false that there is an express charge concerning
contracting marriage, for then John the Evangelist, St. James,
Laurentius, Titus, Martin, Catharine, Barbara, etc., would have sinned.
Nor is Cyprian influenced by these considerations to speak of a virgin
who had made a solemn vow, but of one who had determined to live
continently, as the beginning of Letter XI., Book I sufficiently shows.
For the judgement of St. Augustine is very explicit: "It is damnable for
Virgins who make a vow not only to marry, but even to wish to marry."
Hence the abuse of marriage and the breaking of vows in the clergy are
not to be tolerated.


III. Of the Mass.


Whatever in this article is stated concerning the most holy office
of the mass that agrees with the Holy Roman and Apostolic Church is
approved, but whatever is added that is contrary to the observance
of the general and universal orthodox Church is rejected, because
it grievously offends God, injures Christian unity, and occasions
dissensions, tumults and seditions in the Holy Roman Empire. Now, as to
these things which they state in the article: First, it is displeasing
that, in opposition to the usage of the entire Roman Church, they
perform ecclesiastical rites not in the Roman but in the German
language, and this they pretend that they do upon the authority of St.
Paul, who taught that in the Church a language should be used which is
understood by the people, 1 Cor. 14:19. But if this were the meaning of
the words of St. Paul, it would compel them to perform the entire mass
in German, which even they do not do. But since the priest is a person
belonging to the entire Church, and not only to his surroundings, it is
not wonderful that the priest celebrates the mass in the Latin language
in a Latin Church. It is profitable to the hearer, however, if he hear
the mass in faith of the Church; and experience teaches that among the
Germans there has been greater devotion at mass in Christ's believers who
do not understand the Latin language than in those who today hear the
mass in German. And if the words of the apostle be pondered, it is
sufficient that the one replying occupy the place of the unlearned
to say Amen, the very thing that the canons prescribe. Neither is it
necessary that he hear or understand all the words of the mass, and even
attend to it intelligently; for it is better to understand and to attend
to its end, because the mass is celebrated in order that the Eucharist
may be offered in memory of Christ's passion. And it is an argument in
favor of this that, according to the general opinion of the fathers,
the apostles and their successors until the times of the Emperor Hadrian
celebrated the mass in the Hebrew language alone, which was indeed
unknown to the Christians, especially the converted heathen. But even
if the mass had been celebrated in the primitive Church in a tongue
understood by the people, nevertheless this would not be necessary now,
for many were daily converted who were ignorant of the ceremonies and
unacquainted with the mysteries; and hence it was of advantage for them
to understand the words of the office; but now Catholics imbibe from
their cradles the manners and customs of the Church, whence they readily
know what should be done at every time in the Church. Moreover, as to
their complaints concerning the abuse of masses, there is none of
those who think aright but does not earnestly desire that the abuses be
corrected. __But that they who wait at the altar live of the altar is
not an abuse, but pertains equally to both divine and human law.__ "Who
goeth a warfare any time at his own charge?" says Paul. "Do ye not know
that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the
temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?"
1 Cor 9:7,13. Christ says: "The laborer is worthy of his hire." Luke
10:7. But worthy of censure, above all things, is the discontinuance
of the private mass in certain places, as though those having fixed and
prescribed returns are sought no less than the public masses on
account of gain. But by this abrogation of masses the worship of God is
diminished, honor is withdrawn from the saints, the ultimate will of the
founder is overthrown and defeated, the dead deprived of the rights due
them, and the devotion of the living withdrawn and chilled. Therefore
the abrogation of private masses cannot be conceded and tolerated.
Neither can their assumption be sufficiently understood that Christ by
his passion has made satisfaction for original sin, and has instituted
the mass for actual sin; for this has never been heard by Catholics,
and very many who are now asked most constantly deny that they have
so taught. For the mass does not abolish sins, which are destroyed by
repentance as their peculiar medicine, but abolishes the punishment due
sin, supplies satisfactions, and confers increase of grace and salutary
protection of the living, and, lastly, brings the hope of divine
consolation and aid to all our wants and necessities. Again, their
insinuations that in the mass Christ is not offered must be altogether
rejected, as condemned of old and excluded by the faithful. For
Augustine says this was a very ancient heresy of the Arians, who denied
that in the mass an oblation was made for the living and the dead. For
this is opposed both to the Holy Scriptures and the entire Church. For
through Malachi the Lord predicted the rejection of the Jews, the call
of the Gentiles and the sacrifice of the evangelical law: "I have no
pleasure in you, he saith, neither will I accept an offering at your
hand. For from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the
same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place
incense shall be offered unto my name and a pure offering." Mal 1:10,
11. But no pure offering has already been offered to God in every place,
except in the sacrifice of the altar of the most pure Eucharist. This
authority St. Augustine and other Catholics have used in favor of the
mass against faithless Jews, and certainly with Catholic princes it
should have greater influence than all objections of the adversaries.
Besides, in speaking of the advent of the Messiah the same prophet
says: "And he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and
silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.
Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the
Lord, as in the days of old and as in former years," Mal. 3:3, 4. Here
in the spirit the prophet foresaw the sons of Levi--i.e. evangelical
priests, says Jerome--about to offer sacrifices, not in the blood of
goats, but in righteousness, as in the days of old. Hence these words
are repeated by the Church in the canon of the mass under the influence
of the same Spirit under whose influence they were written by the
prophet. The angel also said to Daniel: "Many shall be purified and
made white and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly, and none of the
wicked shall understand." And again: "The wise shall understand; and
from the time that the daily sacrifices shall be taken away, and the
abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two
hundred and ninety days," Dan. 12:10, 11. Christ testifies that this
prophecy is to be fulfilled, but that it has not been as yet fulfilled,
Matt. 24:15. Therefore the daily sacrifice of Christ will cease
universally at the advent of the abomination--i.e. of Antichrist--just
as it has already ceased, particularly in some churches, and thus will
be unemployed in the place of desolation--viz. when the churches will
be desolated, in which the canonical hours will not be chanted or the
masses celebrated or the sacraments administered, and there will be no
altars, no images of saints, no candles, no furniture. Therefore all
princes and faithful subjects of the Roman Empire ought to be encouraged
never to admit or pass over anything that may aid the preparers
of Antichrist in attaining such a degree of wickedness, when the
woman--i.e. the Catholic Church--as St. John saw in the Spirit, will
flee into the wilderness, where she will have a place prepared of God,
that she may be nourished there twelve hundred and sixty days, Rev.
12:6. Finally, St. Paul says, Heb. 5:1: "Every high priest taken from
among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he
may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins." But since the external
priesthood has not ceased in the new law, but has been changed to a
better, therefore even today the high priest and the entire priesthood
offer in the Church an external sacrifice, which is only one, the
Eucharist. To this topic that also is applicable which is read,
according to the new translation, in Acts 13:1, 2: Barnabas, Simeon,
Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen and Saul sacrificed--i.e. they offered an
oblation, which can and ought justly to be understood not of an oblation
made to idols, but of the mass, since it is called by the Greeks
liturgy. And that in the primitive Church the mass was a sacrifice
the holy fathers copiously testify, and they support this opinion. For
Ignatius, a pupil of St. John the Apostle, says: "It is not allowable
without a bishop either to offer a sacrifice or to celebrate masses."
And Irenaeus, a pupil of John, clearly testifies that "Christ taught the
new oblation of the New Testament, which the Church, receiving from
the apostles, offers to God throughout the entire world." This bishop,
bordering upon the times of the apostles, testifies that the new
evangelical sacrifice was offered throughout the entire world. Origin,
Cyprian, Jerome, Chrysostom, Augustine, Basil, Hilary, etc., teach and
testify the same, whose words for brevity's sake are omitted. Since,
therefore, the Catholic Church throughout the entire Christian world
has always taught, held and observed as it today holds and observes, the
same ought today to be held and observed inviolably. Nor does St. Paul
in Hebrews oppose the oblation of the mass when he says that by one
offering we have once been justified through Christ. For St. Paul is
speaking of the offering of a victim--i.e. of a bloody sacrifice, of
a lamb slain, viz. upon the cross--which offering was indeed once made
whereby all sacraments, and even the sacrifice of the mass, have
their efficacy. Therefore he was offered but once with the shedding of
blood--viz. upon the cross; today he is offered in the mass as a peace
making and sacramental victim. Then he was offered in a visible
form capable of suffering; today he is offered in the mass veiled in
mysteries, incapable of suffering, just as in the Old Testament he was
sacrificed typically and under a figure. Finally, the force of the
word shows that the mass is a sacrifice, since "mass" is nothing but
"oblation," and has received its name from the Hebrew word misbeach,
altar--in Greek thysiasterion, on account of the oblation. It has been
sufficiently declared above that we are justified not properly by faith,
but by love. But if any such statement be found in the Holy Scriptures,
Catholics know that it is declared concerning fides formata, which works
by love (Gal. 5), and because justification is begun by faith, because
it is the substance of things hoped for. Heb. 11:1. Neither is it denied
that the mass is a memorial of Christ's passion and God's benefits,
since this is approved b the figure of the paschal lamb, that was at the
same time a victim and a memorial, Ex. 12:13, 14, and is represented not
only by the Word and sacraments, but also by holy postures and vestments
in the Catholic Church; but to the memory of the victim the Church
offers anew the Eucharist in the mysteries to God the Father Almighty.
Therefore the princes and cities are not censured for retaining one
common mass in the Church, provided they do this according to the sacred
canon, as observed by all Catholics. But in abrogating all other masses
they have done what the Christian profession does not allow. Nor
does any one censure the declaration that of old all who were present
communed. Would that all were so disposed as to be prepared to
partake of this bread worthily every day! But if they regard one mass
advantageous, how much more advantageous would be a number of masses, of
which they nevertheless have unjustly disapproved. When all these
things are properly considered we must ask them to altogether annul and
repudiate this new form of celebrating the mass that has been devised,
and has been already so frequently changed, and to resume the primitive
form for celebrating it according to the ancient rite and custom of the
churches of Germany and all Christendom, and to restore the abrogated
masses according to the ultimate will of their founders; whereby they
would gain advantage and honor for themselves and peace and tranquility
for all Germany.


IV. Of Confession.


As to confession, we must adhere to the reply and judgement given above
in Article XI. For the support which they claim from Chrysostom is
false, since they pervert to sacramental and sacerdotal confession what
he says concerning public confession, as his words clearly indicate when
in the beginning he says: "I do not tell thee to disclose thyself to the
public or to accuse thyself before others." Thus Gratian and thus Peter
Lombard replied three hundred years ago; and the explanation becomes
still more manifest from other passages of Chrysostom. For in his
twenty-ninth sermon he says of the penitent: "In his heart is
contrition, in his mouth confession, in his entire work humility. This
is perfect and fruitful repentance." Does not this most exactly display
the three parts of repentance? So in his tenth homily on Matthew,
Chrysostom teaches of a fixed time for confession, and that after
the wounds of crimes have been opened they should be healed, penance
intervening. But how will crimes lie open if they are not disclosed to
the priest by confession? Thus in several passages Chrysostom himself
refutes this opinion, which Jerome also overthrows, saying: "If
the serpent the devil have secretly bitten any one, and without the
knowledge f another have infected him with the poison of sin, if he who
has been struck be silent and do not repent, and be unwilling to confess
his wound to his brother and instructor, the instructor, who has a
tongue wherewith to cure him, will not readily be able to profit him.
For if the sick man be ashamed to confess to the physician, the medicine
is not adapted to that of which he is ignorant." Let the princes and
cities, therefore, believe these authors rather than a single gloss upon
a decree questioned and rejected by those who are skilled in divine
law. Wherefore, since a full confession is, not to say, necessary for
salvation, but becomes the nerve of Christian discipline and the entire
obedience, they must be admonished to conform to the orthodox Church.
For, according to the testimony of Jerome, this was the heresy of the
Montanist, who were condemned over twelve hundred years ago because they
were ashamed to confess their sins. It is not becoming, therefore, to
adopt the error of the wicked Montanus, but rather the rite of the holy
fathers and the entire Church--viz. that each one teach, according to
the norm of the orthodox faith, that confession, the chief treasure in
the Church, be made in conformity to the rite kept among them also in
the Church.


V. Of the Distinction of Meats.

What they afterwards assert concerning the distinction of meats and like
traditions, of which they seem to make no account, must be rejected. For
we know from the apostle that all power is of God, and especially that
ecclesiastical power has been given by God for edification: for this
reason, from the Christian and devout heart of the holy Church the
constitutions of the same holy, catholic and apostolic Church should
be received as are useful to the Church, as well for promoting divine
worship as for restraining the lust of the flesh, while they enable us
the more readily to keep the divine commands, and when well considered
are found in the Holy Scriptures; and he who despises or rashly resists
them grievously offends God, according to Christ's word: "He that
heareth you, heareth me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me; and he
that despiseth me, despiseth Him that sent me." Luke 10:16. A prelate,
however, is despised when his statutes are despised, according to St.
Paul, not only when he says: "He that despiseth, despiseth not man, but
God, who hath also given unto us his Holy Spirit," 1 Thess. 4:8, but
also to the bishops: "Take heed, therefore, unto yourselves and to all
the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to rule
(Vulgate) the Church of God," Acts 20:28. If prelates, therefore, have
the power to rule, they will have the power also to make statutes for
the salutary government of the Church and the growth of subjects. For
the same apostle enjoined upon the Corinthians that among them all
things should be done in order, 1 Cor. 14:40; but this cannot be done
without laws. On that account he said to the Hebrews: "Obey them that
have the rule over you, and submit yourselves; for they watch for your
souls, as they that must give an account," Heb. 13:17. Here St. Paul
reckons not only obedience, but also the reason for obedience. We see
that St. Paul exercised this power, as, in addition to the Gospel, he
prescribed so many laws concerning the choice of a bishop, concerning
widows, concerning women, that they have their heads veiled, that they
be silent in the church, and concerning even secular matters, 1 Thess.
4:1, 2, 6; concerning civil courts, 1 Cor. 6:1ff. And he says to the
Corinthians very clearly: "But to the rest speak I, not the Lord."
1 Cor. 7.12, and again he says elsewhere: "Stand fast and hold the
traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word or our epistle,"
2 Thess. 2:15. Wherefore, the princes and cities must be admonished to
render obedience to ecclesiastical statutes and constitutions, lest when
they withdraw obedience that is due God, obedience may be withdrawn also
from them by their subjects, as their subjects attempted in the recent
civil insurrection, not to allow themselves to be seduced by false
doctrines. Most false also is their declaration that the righteousness
of faith is obscured by such ordinances; nay, he is rather mad and
insane who would observe them without faith. For they are given to
believers, and not to Turks or Ishmaelites. "For what have I to do to
judge them that are without?" 1 Cor. 5:12. Moreover, in extolling here
faith above all things they antagonize St. Paul, as we have said above,
and do violence to St. Paul, whom they pervert to evangelical works when
he speaks of legal works, as all these errors have been above refuted.
False also is it that ecclesiastical ordinances obscure God's commands,
since they prepare man for these, as fasts suppress the lust of the
flesh and help him from falling into luxury. False also is it that it is
impossible to observe ordinances, for the Church is not a cruel mother
who makes no exceptions in the celebration of festivals and in fasting
and the like. Furthermore, they falsely quote Augustine in reply to the
inquiries of Januarius, who is diametrically opposed to them. For
in this place he most clearly states that what has been universally
delivered by the Church be also universally observed. But in indifferent
things, and those whose observance and non-observance are free, the holy
father Augustine states that, according to the authority of St. Ambrose,
the custom of each church should be observed. "When I come back to
Rome," he says, "I fast on the Sabbath, but when here I do not fast."
Besides, they do violence to the Scriptures while they endeavor
to support their errors. For Christ (Matt. 15) does not absolutely
disapprove of human ordinances, but of those only that were opposed to
the law of God, as is clearly acknowledged in Mark 7:8, 9. Here also
Matt. 15:3 says: "Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by
your tradition?" So Paul (Col. 2) forbids that any one be judged in meat
or in drink, or in respect to the Sabbath, after the Jewish manner; for
when the Church forbids meats it does not judge them to be unclean,
as the Jews in the Synagogue thought. So the declaration of Christ
concerning that which goeth into the mouth (Matt. 15:11) is cited here
without a sure and true understanding of it since its intention was to
remove the error of the Jews, who thought that food touched by unwashen
hands becomes unclean, and rendered one eating it unclean, as is
manifest from the context. Nor does the Church bring back to these
observances Moses with his heavy hands. In like manner they do violence
to St. Paul, for 1 Tim. 4:1, 4, he calls that a doctrine of demons that
forbids meats, as the Tatianites, Marcionites and Manichaeans thought
that meats were unclean, as is clear from the words that follow, when
St. Paul adds: "Every creature of God is good." But the church does
not forbid meats on the ground that they are evil or unclean, but as an
easier way to keep God's commandments; therefore the opposite arguments
fail. If they would preach the cross and bodily discipline and fasts,
that in this way the body be reduced to subjection, their doctrine would
be commendable; but their desire that these be free is condemned and
rejected as alien to the faith and discipline of the Church. Nor does
the diversity of rites support them, for this is properly allowed in
regard to particular matters, in order that each individual province
may have its own taste satisfied, as Jerome says; but individual
ecclesiastical rites should be universally observed, and special rites
should be observed each in their own province. Also, they make no
mention of Easter for the Roman pontiffs reduced the Asiatics to a
uniform observance of Easter with the universal Church. In this way
Irenaeus must be understood, for without the loss of faith some vigils
of the apostles were not celebrated with fasting throughout Gaul, which
Germany nevertheless observes in fasts. The princes and cities must also
be admonished to follow the decision of Pope Gregory, for he enjoins
that the custom of each province be observed if it employs nothing
contrary to the Catholic faith, Canon Quoniam, Distinct xii. Hence we
are not ignorant that there is a various observance of dissimilar rites
in unity of faith, which should be observed in every province as it has
been delivered and received from the ancients, without injury, however,
to the universal rites of the entire Catholic Church.


VI. Of Monastic Vows.

Although many and various matters have been introduced in this article
by the suggestion of certain persons (Another text, Cod. Pflug., reads
"Preachers"), nevertheless, when all are taken into consideration with
mature thought, since monastic vows have their foundation in the Holy
Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, and most holy men, renowned
and admirable by miracles, have lived in these religious orders with
many thousand thousands, and for so many centuries their ordinances and
rules of living have been received and approved throughout the entire
Christian world by the Catholic Church, it is in no way to be tolerated
that vows are licentiously broken without any fear of God. For, in the
Old Testament, God approved the vows of the Nazarenes, Num 6:2ff, and
the vows of the Rechabites, who neither drank wine or ate grapes, Jer.
36:6, 19; while he strictly requires that the vow once made be paid,
Deut. 23:21f; "It is ruin to a man after vows to retract," Prov. 20:25;
"The vows of the just are acceptable," Prov. 15:8. God also teaches
specifically through the prophet that monastic vows please him. For
in Isa. 56:4, 5 it is read as follows: "Thus saith the Lord unto the
eunuchs that keep my Sabbath, and choose the things that pease me and
take hold of my covenant, Even unto them will I give in mine house
and within my walls a place and a name better than that of sons and of
daughters. I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be
cut off." But to what eunuchs does God make these promises? To those,
undoubtedly, whom Christ praises, "which have made themselves eunuchs
for the kingdom of heaven's sake," Matt. 19:12; to those, undoubtedly,
who, denying their own, come after Christ and deny themselves and follow
him, Luke 9:23, so that they are governed no longer by their own will,
but by that of their rule and superior. In like manner, according to the
testimony of the apostle, those virgins do better who, contemning
the world and spurning its enticements, vow and maintain virginity in
monasteries, than those who place their necks beneath the matrimonial
burden. For thus St. Paul says, 1 Cor. 7:28: "He that giveth her in
marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth
better." Also, concerning a widow, he continues: "She is happier if she
so abide, after my judgment." No one is ignorant of the holiness of the
hermit Paul, of Basil, Anthony, Benedict, Bernard, Dominic, Franciscus,
Wiliam, Augustine, Clara, Bridget, and similar hermits, who indeed
despised the entire realm of the world and all the splendor of the age
on account of love to our Lord Jesus Christ. Moreover, the heresy of
the Lampetians was condemned in most ancient times, which the heretic
Jovinian attempted in vain to revive at Rome. Therefore, all things
must be rejected which in this article have been produced against
monasticism--viz. that monasteries succeeded vows. Of the nunneries it
is sufficiently ascertained that, though pertaining to the weaker sex,
how in most cloisters the holy nuns persevered far more constantly to
vows once uttered, even under these princes and cities, than th majority
of monks; even to this day it has been impossible to move them from
their holy purpose by any prayers, blandishments, threats, terrors,
difficulties or distresses. Wherefore, those matters are not to be
admitted which are interpreted unfavorably, since it has been expressly
declared in the Holy Scriptures that the monastic life, when kept with
proper observance, as may by the grace of God be rendered by any monks,
merits eternal life; and indeed Christ has promised to them a much
more bountiful reward, saying: "Every one that hath forsaken houses,
or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children
or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundred-fold, and shall
inherit everlasting life," Matt. 19:29. That monasteries, as they show,
were formerly literary schools, is not denied; nevertheless, there is
no ignorance of the fact that these were at first schools of virtues and
discipline, to which literature was afterwards added. But since no one
putting his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom
of heaven, Luke 9:62, all marriages and breaking of vows by monks and
nuns should be regarded as condemned, according to the tenor not only of
the Holy Scriptures, but also of the laws and canons, "having damnation,
because they have cast off their first faith," as St. Paul says, 1 Tim.
5:12. Moreover, that vows are not contrary to the ordinance of God
as been declared with reference to the second article of the alleged
abuses. That they attempt to defend themselves by dispensations of
the Pope is of no effect. For although the Pope has perhaps made a
dispensation for the king of Aragon, who, we read, returned to the
monastery after having had offspring, or for any other prince on account
of the peace of the entire kingdom or province, to prevent the exposure
of the entire kingdom or province to wars, carnage, pillae, debauchery,
conflagrations, murders,--nevertheless, in private persons who abandon
vows in apostasy such grounds for dispensations cannot be urged. For
the assumption is repelled that the vow concerns a matter that is
impossible. For continence, which so many thousands of men and virgins
have maintained, is not impossible. For although the wise man says
(Wisd. 8:21): "I knew that I could not otherwise be continent, unless
God gave it me," nevertheless Christ promised to give it. "Seek," he
says, "and ye shall find," 11:9; Matt 18:28; and St. Paul says: "God is
faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able,
but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be
able to bear it," 1 Cor. 10:13. They are also poor defenders of their
cause when they admit that the violation of a vow is irreprehensible,
and it must be declared that by law such marriages are censured and
should be dissolved, C. Ut. Continentiae, xxvii. Q. 1, as also by the
ancient statutes of emperors. But when they allege in their favor C.
Nuptiarum, They accomplish nothing, for it speaks of a simple not of a
religious vow, which the Church observes also to this day. The marriages
of monks, nuns, or priests, have therefore never been ratified. Futile
also is their statement that a votive life is an invention of men, for
it has been founded upon the Holy Scriptures, inspired into the most
holy fathers by the Holy Ghost. Nor does it deny honor to Christ, since
monks observe all things for Christ's sake and imitate Christ. False,
therefore, is the judgement whereby they condemn monastic service as
godless, whereas it is most Christian. For the monks have not fallen
from God's grace, as the Jews of whom St. Paul speaks, Gal. 5:4, when
they still sought justification by the law of Moses; but the monks
endeavor to live more nearly to the Gospel, that theymay merit eternal
life. Therefore, the allegations here made against monasticism are
impious. Moreover, the malicious charge that is still further added,
that those in religious orders claim to be in a state of perfection,
has never been heard of by them; for those in these orders claim not for
themselves a state of perfection, but only a state in which to acquire
perfection--because their regulations are instruments of perfection, and
not perfection itself. In this manner Gerson must be received, who does
not deny that religious orders are states wherein to acquire perfection
as he declares in his treatises, "Against the Proprietors of the Rule of
St. Augustine", "Of Evangelical Counsels", "Of Perfection of Heart",
and in other places. For this reason the princes and cities should be
admonished to strive rather for the reformation of the monasteries by
their legitimate superiors than for their subversion--rather for the
godly improvement of the monks than that they be abolished; as their
most religious ancestors, most Christian princes, have done. But if
they will not believe holy and most religious fathers defending
monastic vows, let them hear at least His Imperial Highness, the Emperor
Justinian, in "Authentica," De Monachis, Coll. ii.


VII. Of Ecclesiastical Power.


Although many things are introduced here in the topic of Ecclesiastical
Power, with greater bitterness than is just, yet it must be declared
that to most reverend bishops and priests, and to the entire clergy, all
ecclesiastical power is freely conceded that belongs to them by law
or custom. Besides, it is proper to preserve for them all immunities,
privileges, preferments and prerogatives granted them by Roman emperors
and kings. Nor can those things that have been granted ecclesiastics by
imperial munificence or gift be allowed to be infringed by any princes
or any other subject of the Roman Empire. For it is most abundantly
proved that ecclesiastical power in spiritual things has been founded
upon divine right, of which St. Paul indeed says: "For though I should
boast somewhat more of our authority which the Lord hath given us for
edification, and not for your destruction," 2 Cor. 10:8, and afterwards:
"Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I
should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given
me to edification, and not to destruction," 2 Cor. 13:10. Paul also
displays his coercitive disposition when he says: "What will ye? Shall
I come unto you with a rod, or in love and in the spirit of meekness?"
1 Cor. 4:21. And of judicial matters he writes to Timothy: "Against an
elder receive not an accusation but before two or three witnesses," 1
Tim. 5:19. From these passages it is very clearly discerned that bishops
have the power not only of the ministry of the Word of God, but also of
ruling and coercitive correction in order to direct subjects to the goal
of eternal blessedness. But for the power of ruling there is required
the power to judge, to define, to discriminate and to decide what is
expedient or conducive to the aforesaid goal. In vain, therefore, and
futile is all that is inserted in the present article in opposition to
the immunity of churches and schools. Accordingly, all subjects of the
Roman Empire must be forbidden from bringing the clergy before a civil
tribunal, contrary to imperial privileges that have been conceded: for
Pope Clement the Martyr says: "If any of the presbyters have trouble
with one another, let whatever it be adjusted before the presbyters of
the Church." Hence Constantine the Great, the most Christian Emperor,
was unwilling in the holy Council of Nice to give judgement even in
secular cases. "Ye are gods," he says, "appointed by the true God. Go,
settle the case among yourselves, be cause it is not proper that
we judge gods." As to what is further repeated concerning Church
regulations has been sufficiently replied to above. Nor does Christian
liberty, which they bring forth as an argument, avail them, since this
is not liberty, but prodigious license, which, inculcated on the people,
excites them to fatal and most dangerous sedition. For Christian liberty
is not opposed to ecclesiastical usages since they promote what is good,
but it is opposed to the servitude of the Mosaic law and the servitude
of sin. "Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin," says Christ,
John 8:34. Hence their breaking fasts, their free partaking of meats,
their neglect of canonical hours, their omission of confession--viz. at
Easter--and their commission and omission of similar things, are not a
use of liberty, but an abuse thereof, contrary to the warnings of St.
Paul, who earnestly warned them, saying: "Brethren, ye have been called
unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by
love serve one another." Gal. 5:13. Hence no one ought to conceal
his crimes under the pretext of Gospel liberty, which St. Peter
also forbade: "As free, and not using your liberty for an cloak of
maliciousness, but as the servant of God," 1 Pet. 2:16. As to what they
have added concerning abuses, all the princes and estates of the Empire
undoubtedly know that not even the least is approved either by His
Imperial Majesty or by any princes or any Christian man, but that both
the princes and the estates of the Empire desire to strive with a common
purpose and agreement, in order that, the abuses being removed and
reformed, the excesses of both estates may be either utterly abolished
or reformed for the better, and that the ecclesiastical estate, which
has been weakened in many ways, and the Christian religion, which has
grown cold and relaxed in some, may be restored and renewed to its
pristine glory and distinction. To this, as is evident to all, His
Imperial Majesty has thus far devoted the greatest care and labor, and
kindly promises in the future to employ for this cause all his means and
zeal.


Conclusion


From the foregoing--viz. the Confession and its Reply--since His
Imperial Majesty perceives that the Elector, the princes and the cities
agree on many points with the Catholic and Roman Church, and dissent
from the godless dogmas that are disseminated all over Germany, and the
pamphlets circulated everywhere, and that they disapprove of and condemn
them,--His Holy Imperial Majesty is fully convinced, and hopes that the
result will be, that when the Elector, princes and cities have heard
and understood this Reply they will agree with united minds in regard to
those matters also in which they perhaps have not agreed hitherto with
the Roman Catholic Church, and that in all other things above mentioned
they will obediently conform to the Catholic and Roman Church and
the Christian faith and religion. For such conduct on their part His
Imperial Majesty will be peculiarly grateful, and will bestow his
special favor upon them all in common, and also, as opportunity offers,
upon them individually. For (which may God forbid) if this admonition,
so Christian and indulgent, be unheeded, the Elector, princes and cities
can judge that a necessary cause is afforded His Imperial Majesty that,
as becometh a Roman Emperor and Christian Caesar and a defender and
advocate of the Catholic and Christian Church, he must care for such
matters as the nature of the charge committed to him and his integrity
of conscience require.

I have transcribed from this source as accurately as possible for
this e-text, with the following changes:
1) I formatted each verse into a separate line and added the chapter
number to each verse number.  In doing this I lost the source's
paragraph structure.
2) I exploded the ligatures for "ae" and "oe" into two characters
rather than one character for each diphthong.
3) I capitalized all of the section headings which were either in
bold or italicized print originally.  These sections headings may
not be original to the Vulgate, but then neither are verse numbers.
4) In all references to verses I used a colon to separate the
chapter number and verse number rather than a comma as in the source.
5) I placed the footnote designators in parentheses and re-lettered
them for the whole body of the text.  The original recycled to "a"
for each new page.  I also arranged the cross reference footnotes
themselves into one chart at the end of the text.
6) I moved the marginal notations into an appendix.

Verses 3:52-3:90 are formatted differently than the rest of the text.
This is because this section is a song/poem that was formatted
specially in the source text.

Verse 3:98 begins with a capitalized word.  I know this is against
Project Gutenberg standards, but this is the only "first" word so
treated in the source text.  I defer to the source's editor's
judgement in this matter, and request that it remain as is.  There are
other words in the text capitalized, but they do not begin a section.

Please note that some sentence-like sections end with a period, but
the following line does not begin with a capital letter.  I recommend
that this format remain.  The source's editor seems to have been
quite confident in the propriety of this approach.  I have retained
all of the source's capitalization and punctuation except for the
section headers.

65 is the target line length, but because of the length of many
of the Latin words, my desire not to create "orphan" words, and
a genuine lack of talent on the part of the transcriber for such
matters, the margination is rather ragged.


This text carries no warranty of any kind.

PROPHETIA DANIELIS.





PARS PRIOR.
HISTORIA DANIELIS PROPHETAE, 1:1-6:28.




I. VITA PRIVATA, 1:1-21.


1:1 Anno tertio regni Ioakim regis Iuda, venit Nabuchodonosor rex
Babylonis in Ierusalem, et obsedit eam;

1:2 et tradidit Dominus in manu eius Ioakim regem Iuda, et partem
vasorum domus Dei: et asportavit ea in terram Sennaar in domum dei sui,
et vasa intulit in domum Thesauri dei sui.

1:3 Et ait rex Asphenez praeposito Eunuchorum ut introduceret de
filiis Israel, et de semine regio et tyrannorum,

1:4 pueros, in quibus nulla esset macula, decoros forma, et eruditos
omni sapientia, cautos scientia, et doctos disciplina, et qui possent
stare in palatio regis, ut doceret eos litteras, et linguam Chaldaeorum.

1:5 Et constituit eis rex annonam per singulos dies de cibis suis,
et de vino unde bibebat ipse, ut enutriti tribus annis, postea
starent in conspectu regis.

1:6 Fuerunt ergo inter eos de filiis Iuda, Daniel, Ananias, Misael,
et Azarias.

1:7 Et imposuit eis praepositus eunuchorum, nomina: Danieli, Baltassar:
Ananiae, Sidrach: Misaeli, Misach: et Azariae, Abdenago.

1:8 Proposuit autem Daniel in corde suo ne pollueretur de mensa regis,
neque de vino potus eius: et rogavit eunuchorum praepositum ne
contaminaretur.

1:9 Dedit autem Deus Danieli gratiam et misericordiam in conspectu
principis eunuchorum.

1:10 Et ait princeps eunuchorum ad Danielem: Timeo ego dominum
meum regem, qui constituit vobis cibum et potum: qui si viderit
vultus vestros macilentiores prae ceteris adolescentibus coaevis
vestris, condemnabitis caput meum regi.

1:11 Et dixit Daniel ad Malasar, quem constituerat princeps eunuchorum
super Danielem, Ananiam, Misaelem, et Azariam:

1:12 Tenta nos obsecro servos tuos diebus decem, et dentur nobis
legumina ad vescendum, et aqua ad bibendum:

1:13 et contemplare vultus nostros, et vultus puerorum, qui vescuntur
cibo regio: et sicut videris, facies cum servis tuis.

1:14 Qui, audito sermone huiuscemodi, tentavit eos diebus decem.

1:15 Post dies autem decem apparuerunt vultus eorum meliores,
et corpulentiores prae omnibus pueris, qui vescebantur cibo regio.

1:16 Porro Malasar tollebat cibaria, et vinum potus eorum:
dabatque eis legumina.

1:17 Pueris autem his dedit Deus scientiam, et disciplinam in omni libro,
et sapientia: Danieli autem intelligentiam omnium visionum et somniorum.

1:18 Completis itaque diebus, post quos dixerat rex ut introducerentur:
introduxit eos praepositus eunuchorum in conspectu Nabuchodonosor.

1:19 Cumque eis locutus fuisset rex, non sunt inventi tales de universis,
ut Daniel, Ananias, Misael, et Azarias: et steterunt in conspectu Regis.

1:20 Et omne verbum sapientiae et intellectus, quod sciscitatus est
ab eis Rex, invenit in eis decuplum super cunctos ariolos, et magos,
qui erant in universo regno eius.

1:21 (a) Fuit autem Daniel usque ad annum primum Cyri regis.



II. VITA PUBLICA, 2:1-6:28.


1. DANIEL REGI SOMNIUM APERIT ET DECLARAT, 2:1-49.


2:1 In anno secundo regni Nabuchodonosor vidit Nabuchodonosor somnium,
et conterritus est spiritus eius, et somnium eius fugit ab eo.

2:2 Praecepit autem rex, ut convocarentur arioli, et magi, et malefici,
et Chaldaei: ut indicarent regi somnia sua: qui cum venissent,
steterunt coram rege.

2:3 Et dixit ad eos rex: Vidi somnium: et mente confusus ignoro quid viderim.

2:4 Responderuntque Chaldaei regi Syriace: Rex in sempiternum vive:
dic somnium servis tuis, et interpretationem eius indicabimus.

2:5 Et respondens rex ait Chaldaeis: Sermo recessit a me:
nisi indicaveritis mihi somnium, et coniecturam eius, peribitis vos,
et domus vestrae publicabuntur.

2:6 Si autem somnium, et coniecturam eius narraveritis, praemia,
et dona, et honorem multum accipietis a me: somnium igitur,
et interpretationem eius indicate mihi.

2:7 Responderunt secundo, atque dixerunt: Rex somnium dicat servis suis,
et interpretationem illius indicabimus.

2:8 Respondit rex, et ait: Certe novi quod tempus redimitis,
scientes quod recesserit a me sermo.

2:9 Si ergo somnium non indicaveritis mihi, una est de vobis sententia,
quod interpretationem quoque fallacem, et deceptione plenam composueritis,
ut loquamini mihi donec tempus pertranseat.  Somnium itaque dicite mihi,
ut sciam quod interpretationem quoque eius veram loquamini.

2:10 Respondentes ergo Chaldaei coram rege, dixerunt: Non est homo
super terram, qui sermonem tuum, rex, possit implere: sed neque
regum quisquam magnus et potens verbum huiuscemodi sciscitatur ab
omni ariolo, et mago, et Chaldaeo.

2:11 Sermo enim, quem tu quaeris, rex, gravis est: nec reperietur
quisquam, qui indicet illum in conspectu regis: exceptis diis,
quorum non est cum hominibus conversatio.

2:12 Quo audito, rex in furore, et in ira magna praecepit ut
perirent omnes sapientes Babylonis.

2:13 Et egressa sententia, sapientes interficiebantur:
quaerebanturque Daniel, et socii eius, ut perirent.

2:14 Tunc Daniel requisivit de lege, atque sententia ab Arioch
principe militiae regis, qui egressus fuerat ad interficiendos
sapientes Babylonis.

2:15 Et interrogavit eum, qui a rege potestatem acceperat,
quam ob causam tam crudelis sententia a facie regis esset egressa.
Cum ergo rem indicasset Arioch Danieli,

2:16 Daniel ingressus rogavit regem ut tempus daret sibi ad
solutionem indicandam regi.

2:17 Et ingressus est domum suam, Ananiaeque et Misaeli, et Azariae
sociis suis indicavit negotium:

2:18 ut quaererent misericordiam a facie Dei caeli super sacramento isto,
et non perirent Daniel, et socii eius cum ceteris sapientibus Babylonis.

2:19 Tunc Danieli mysterium per visionem nocte revelatum est:
et benedixit Daniel Deum caeli,

2:20 et locutus ait: Sit nomen Domini benedictum a saeculo et
usque in saeculum: quia sapientia et fortitudo eius sunt.

2:21 Et ipse mutat tempora, et aetates: transfert regna, atque constituit:
dat sapientiam sapientibus, et scientiam intelligentibus disciplinam:

2:22 Ipse revelat profunda, et abscondita, et novit in tenebris constituta:
et lux cum eo est.

2:23 Tibi Deus patrum nostrorum confiteor, teque laudo:
quia sapientiam, et fortitudinem dedisti mihi: et nunc ostendisti
mihi quae rogavimus te, quia sermonem regis aperuisti nobis.

2:24 Post haec Daniel ingressus ad Arioch, quem constituerat
rex ut perderet sapientes Babylonis, sic ei locutus est:
Sapientes Babylonis ne perdas: introduc me in conspectu regis,
et solutionem regi narrabo.

2:25 Tunc Arioch festinus introduxit Danielem ad regem, et dixit ei:
Inveni hominem de filiis transmigrationis Iuda, qui solutionem regi annunciet.

2:26 Respondit rex, et dixit Danieli, cuius nomen erat Baltassar:
Putasne vere potes mihi indicare somnium, quod vidi, et interpretationem eius?

2:27 Et respondens Daniel coram rege, ait: Mysterium, quod rex interrogat,
sapientes, magi, arioli, et aruspices nequeunt indicare regi:

2:28 Sed est Deus in caelo revelans mysteria, qui indicavit tibi
rex Nabuchodonosor, quae ventura sunt in novissimis temporibus.
Somnium tuum, et visiones capitis tui in cubili tuo huiuscemodi sunt:

2:29 Tu rex cogitare coepisti in strato tuo, quid esset futurum
post haec: et qui revelat mysteria, ostendit tibi quae ventura sunt.

2:30 Mihi quoque non in sapientia, quae est in me plus quam in
cunctis viventibus, sacramentum hoc revelatum est: sed ut interpretatio
regi manifesta fieret, et cogitationes mentis tuae scires.

2:31 Tu rex videbas, et ecce quasi statua una grandis: statua illa magna,
et statura sublimis stabat contra te, et intuitus eius erat terribilis.

2:32 Huius statuae caput ex auro optimo erat, pectus autem et
brachia de argento, porro venter, et femora ex aere.

2:33 tibiae autem ferreae, pedum quaedam pars erat ferrea,
quaedam autem fictilis.

2:34 Videbas ita, donec abscissus est lapis de monte sine manibus:
et percussit statuam in pedibus eius ferreis, et fictilibus,
et comminuit eos.

2:35 Tunc contrita sunt pariter ferrum, testa, aes, argentum, et aurum,
et redacta quasi in favillam aestivae areae, quae rapta sunt vento:
nullusque locus inventus est eis: lapis autem, qui percusserat statuam,
factus est mons magnus, et implevit universam terram.

2:36 hoc est somnium.  Interpretationem quoque eius dicemus coram te, rex.

2:37 Tu rex regum es: et Deus caeli, regnum, et fortitudinem,
et imperium, et gloriam dedit tibi:

2:38 et omnia, in quibus habitant filii hominum, et bestiae agri:
volucres quoque caeli dedit in manu tua, et sub ditione tua
universa constituit: tu es ergo caput aureum.

2:39 Et post te consurget regnum aliud minus te argenteum:
et regnum tertium aliud aereum, quod imperabit universae terrae.

2:40 Et regnum quartum erit velut ferrum. quomodo ferrum comminuit,
et domat omnia, sic comminuet, et conteret omnia haec.

2:41 Porro quia vidisti pedum, et digitorum partem testae figuli,
et partem ferream: regnum divisum erit, quod tamen de plantario
ferri orietur, secundum quod vidisti ferrum mistum testae ex luto.

2:42 Et digitos pedum ex parte ferreos, et ex parte fictiles:
ex parte regnum erit solidum, et ex parte contritum.

2:43 Quod autem vidisti ferrum mistum testae ex luto,
commiscebuntur quidem humano semine, sed non adhaerebunt sibi,
sicut ferrum misceri non potest testae.

2:44 In diebus autem regnorum illorum suscitabit Deus caeli regnum,
quod in aeternum non dissipabitur, et regnum eius alteri populo
non tradetur: comminuet autem, et consumet universa regna haec:
et ipsum stabit in aeternum.

2:45 Secundum quod vidisti, quod de monte abscissus est lapis
sine manibus, et comminuit testam, et ferrum, et aes, et argentum,
et aurum, Deus magnus ostendit regi quae ventura sunt postea.
et verum est somnium, et fidelis interpretatio eius.

2:46 Tunc rex Nabuchodonosor cecidit in faciem suam, et Danielem
adoravit, et hostias, et incensum praecepit ut sacrificarent ei.

2:47 Loquens ergo rex, ait Danieli: Vere Deus vester Deus deorum est,
et Dominus regum, et revelans mysteria: quoniam tu potuisti aperire
hoc sacramentum.

2:48 Tunc rex Danielem in sublime extulit, et munera multa, et magna
dedit ei: et constituit eum principem super omnes provincias Babylonis:
et praefectum magistratuum super cunctos sapientes Babylonis.

2:49 Daniel autem postulavit a rege: et constituit super opera
provinciae Babylonis, Sidrach, Misach, et Abdenago: Ipse autem
Daniel erat in foribus regis.



2. SOCII DANIELIS IN FORNACE SERVANTUR, 3:1-97.


3:1 Nabuchodonosor rex fecit statuam auream altitudine cubitorum sexaginta,
latitudine cubitorum sex, et statuit eam in campo Dura provinciae Babylonis.

3:2 Itaque Nabuchodonosor rex misit ad congregandos satrapas, magistratus,
et iudices, duces, et tyrannos, et praefectos, omnesque principes regionum,
ut convenirent ad dedicationem statuae, quam erexerat Nabuchodonosor rex.

3:3 Tunc congregati sunt satrapae, magistratus, et iudices, duces,
et tyranni, et optimates, qui erant in potestatibus constituti,
et universi principes regionum ut convenirent ad dedicationem statuae,
quam erexerat Nabuchodonosor rex. stabant autem in conspectu statuae,
quam posuerat Nabuchodonosor rex:

3:4 et praeco clamabat valenter: Vobis dicitur populis, tribubus,
et linguis:

3:5 In hora, qua audieritis sonitum tubae, et fistulae, et citharae,
sambucae, et psalterii, et symphoniae, et universi generis musicorum,
cadentes adorate statuam auream, quam constituit Nabuchodonosor rex.

3:6 Si quis autem non prostratus adoraverit, eadem hora mittetur
in fornacem ignis ardentis.

3:7 Post haec igitur statim ut audierunt omnes populi sonitum tubae,
fistulae, et citharae, sambucae, et psalterii, et symphoniae,
et omnis generis musicorum: cadentes omnes populi, tribus, et linguae
adoraverunt statuam auream, quam constituerat Nabuchodonosor rex.

3:8 Statimque in ipso tempore accedentes viri Chaldaei accusaverunt Iudaeos:

3:9 dixeruntque Nabuchodonosor regi: Rex in aeternum vive:

3:10 tu rex posuisti decretum, ut omnis homo, qui audierit sonitum tubae,
fistulae, et citharae, sambucae, et psalterii, et symphoniae, et universi
generis musicorum, prosternat se, et adoret statuam auream:

3:11 si quis autem non procidens adoraverit, mittatur in fornacem
ignis ardentis.

3:12 Sunt ergo viri Iudaei, quos constituisti super opera
regionis Babylonis, Sidrach, Misach, et Abdenago: viri isti
contempserunt, rex, decretum tuum: deos tuos non colunt,
et statuam auream, quam erexisti, non adorant.

3:13 Tunc Nabuchodonosor in furore, et in ira praecepit ut adducerentur
Sidrach, Misach, et Abdenago: qui confestim adducti sunt in conspectu regis.

3:14 Pronunciansque Nabuchodonosor rex, ait eis: Verene Sidrach,
Misach, et Abdenago deos meos non colitis, et statuam auream,
quam constitui, non adoratis?

3:15 Nunc ergo si estis parati, quacumque hora audieritis sonitum tubae,
fistulae, citharae, sambucae, et psalterii, et symphoniae,
omnisque generis musicorum, prosternite vos, et adorate statuam, quam feci:
quod si non adoraveritis, eadem hora mittemini in fornacem ignis ardentis:
et quis est Deus, qui eripiet vos de manu mea?

3:16 Respondentes Sidrach, Misach, et Abdenago, dixerunt regi
Nabuchodonosor: Non oportet nos de hac re respondere tibi.

3:17 Ecce enim Deus noster, quem colimus, potest eripere nos de
camino ignis ardentis, et de manibus tuis, o rex, liberare.

3:18 Quod si noluerit, notum sit tibi, rex, quia deos tuos non colimus,
et statuam auream, quam erexisti, non adoramus.

3:19 Tunc Nabuchodonosor repletus est furore: et aspectus faciei
illius immutatus est super Sidrach, Misach, et Abdenago, et praecepit
ut succenderetur fornax septuplum quam succendi consueverat.

3:20 Et viris fortissimis de exercitu suo iussit ut ligatis pedibus
Sidrach, Misach, et Abdenago mitterent eos in fornacem ignis ardentis.

3:21 Et confestim viri illi vincti cum braccis suis, et tiaris, et
calceamentis, et vestibus missi sunt in medium fornacis ignis ardentis.

3:22 nam iussio regis urgebat: fornax autem succensa erat nimis.
Porro viros illos, qui miserant Sidrach, Misach, et Abdenago,
interfecit flamma ignis.

3:23 Viri autem hi tres, id est, Sidrach, Misach, et Abdenago,
ceciderunt in medio camino ignis ardentis, colligati.

QUAE SEQUUNTUR IN HEBRAEIS VOLUMINIBUS NON REPERI.

3:24 Et ambulabant in medio flammae laudantes Deum, et benedicentes Domino.

3:25 Stans autem Azarias oravit sic, aperiensque os suum in medio ignis, ait:

3:26 Benedictus es Domine Deus patrum nostrorum, et laudabile,
et gloriosum nomen tuum in saecula:

3:27 quia iustus es in omnibus, quae fecisti nobis, et universa opera
tua vera, et viae tuae rectae, et omnia iudicia tua vera.

3:28 Iudicia enim vera fecisti iuxta omnia, quae induxisti super nos,
et super civitatem sanctam patrum nostrorum Ierusalem: quia in veritate,
et in iudicio induxisti omnia haec propter peccata nostra.

3:29 Peccavimus enim, et inique egimus recedentes a te:
et deliquimus in omnibus:

3:30 et praecepta tua non audivimus, nec observavimus, nec fecimus
sicut praeceperas nobis ut bene nobis esset.

3:31 omnia ergo, quae induxisti super nos, et universa,
quae fecisti nobis, in vero iudicio fecisti:

3:32 et tradidisti nos in manibus inimicorum nostrorum iniquorum,
et pessimorum, praevaricatorumque et regi iniusto, et pessimo ultra
omnem terram.

3:33 Et nunc non possumus aperire os: confusio, et opprobrium
facti sumus servis tuis, et his, qui colunt te.

3:34 Ne, quaesumus, tradas nos in perpetuum propter nomen tuum,
et ne dissipes testamentum tuum.

3:35 neque auferas misericordiam tuam a nobis propter Abraham
dilectum tuum, et Isaac servum tuum, et Israel sanctum tuum:

3:36 quibus locutus es pollicens quod multiplicares semen eorum
sicut stellas caeli, et sicut arenam, quae est in littore maris:

3:37 quia Domine imminuti sumus plus quam omnes gentes,
sumusque humiles in universa terra hodie propter peccata nostra.

3:38 Et non est in tempore hoc princeps, et dux, et propheta,
neque holocaustum, neque sacrificium, neque oblatio, neque incensum,
neque locus primitiarum coram te,

3:39 ut possimus invenire misericordiam tuam: sed in animo contrito,
et spiritu humilitatis suscipiamur.

3:40 Sicut in holocausto arietum, et taurorum, et sicut in millibus
agnorum pinguium: sic fiat sacrificium nostrum in conspectu tuo hodie,
ut placeat tibi: quoniam non est confusio confidentibus in te.

3:41 Et nunc sequimur te in toto corde, et timemus te, et quaerimus
faciem tuam.

3:42 Ne confundas nos: sed fac nobiscum iuxta mansuetudinem tuam,
et secundum multitudinem misericordiae tuae.

3:43 Et erue nos in mirabilibus tuis, et da gloriam nomini tuo Domine:

3:44 et confundantur omnes, qui ostendunt servis tuis mala,
confundantur in omni potentia tua, et robur eorum conteratur:

3:45 et sciant quia tu es Dominus Deus solus, et gloriosus super
orbem terrarum.

3:46 Et non cessabant qui miserant eos ministri regis succendere
fornacem, naphtha, et stuppa, et pice, et malleolis,

3:47 et effundebatur flamma super fornacem cubitis quadraginta novem:

3:48 et erupit, et incendit quos reperit iuxta fornacem de Chaldaeis.

3:49 Angelus autem Domini descendit cum Azaria, et sociis eius in fornacem:
et excussit flammam ignis de fornace,

3:50 et fecit medium fornacis quasi ventum roris flantem,
et non tetigit eos omnino ignis, neque contristavit, nec quidquam
molestiae intulit.

3:51 Tunc hi tres quasi ex uno ore laudabant, et glorificabant,
et benedicebant Deum in fornace, dicentes:

3:52 Benedictus es Domine Deus patrum nostrorum:
  et laudabilis, et gloriosus, et superexaltatus in saecula.
et benedictum nomen gloriae tutae sanctum:
  et laudabile, et superexaltatum in omnibus saeculis.
3:53 Benedictus es in templo sancto gloriae tuae:
  et superlaudabilis, et supergloriosus in saecula.
3:54 Benedictus es in throno regni tui:
  et superlaudabilis, et superexaltatus in saecula.
3:55 Benedictus es, qui intueris abyssos, et sedes super cherubim:
  et laudabilis, et superexaltatus in saecula.
3:56 Benedictus es in firmamento caeli:
  et laudabilis et gloriosus in saecula.

3:69 Benedicite gelu, et frigus Domino:
  laudate et superexaltate eum in saecula.
3:70 Benedicite glacies, et nives Domino:
  laudate et superexaltate eum in saecula.
3:71 Benedicite noctes, et dies Domino
  laudate et superexaltate eum in saecula.
3:72 Benedicite lux, et tenebrae Domino:

3:88 Benedicite Anania, Azaria, Misael Domino:

Quia eruit nos de inferno,
  et salvos fecit de manu mortis,
et liberavit nos de medio ardentis flammae,
  et de medio ignis eruit nos.
3:89 Confitemini Domino, quoniam bonus:
  quoniam in saeculum misericordia eius.
3:90 Benedicite omnes religiosi Domino Deo deorum:
  laudate et confitemini ei, quia in omnia saecula misericordia eius.

HUCUSQUE IN HEBRAEO NON HABETUR: ET QUAE POSUIMUS,
DE THEODOTIONIS EDITIONE TRANSLATA SUNT.

3:91 Tunc Nabuchodonosor rex obstupuit, et surrexit propere,
et ait optimatibus suis: Nonne tres viros misimus in medium
ignis compeditos?  Qui respondentes regi, dixerunt: Vere rex.

3:92 Respondit, et ait: Ecce ego video quattuor viros solutos,
et ambulantes in medio ignis, et nihil corruptionis in eis est,
et species quarti similis filio Dei.

3:93 Tunc accessit Nabuchodonosor ad ostium fornacis ignis ardentis, et ait:
Sidrach, Misach, et Abdenago servi Dei excelsi, egredimini, et venite.
Statimque egressi sunt Sidrach, Misach, et Abdenago de medio ignis.

3:94 Et congregati satrapae et magistratus, et iudices, et potentes
regis contemplabantur viros illos, quoniam nihil potestatis habuisset
ignis in corporibus eorum, et capillus capitis eorum non esset adustus,
et sarabala eorum non fuissent immutata, et odor ignis non transisset per eos.

3:95 Et erumpens Nabuchodonosor, ait: Benedictus Deus eorum,
Sidrach videlicet, Misach, et Abdenago, qui misit angelum suum,
et eruit servos suos, qui crediderunt in eum: et verbum regis
immutaverunt, et tradiderunt corpora sua ne servirent, et ne
adorarent omnem deum, excepto Deo suo.

3:96 A me ergo positum est hoc decretum, ut omnis populus, tribus,
et lingua, quaecumque locuta fuerit blasphemiam contra Deum
Sidrach, Misach, et Abdenago, dispereat, et domus eius vastetur:
neque enim est alius Deus, qui possit ita salvare.

3:97 Tunc rex promovit Sidrach, Misach, et Abdenago in provincia Babylonis.



3. NABUCHODONOSOR MENTE CAPITUR ET SANATUR, 3:98-4:34.


3:98 NABUCHODONOSOR rex, omnibus populis, gentibus, et linguis,
qui habitant in universa terra, pax vobis multiplicetur.

3:99 Signa, et mirabilia fecit apud me Deus excelsus.
Placuit ergo mihi praedicare

3:100 signa eius, quia magna sunt: et mirabilia eius, quia fortia:
et regnum eius regnum sempiternum, et (c) potestas eius in
generationem et generationem.

4:1 Ego Nabuchodonosor quietus eram in domo mea, et florens in palatio meo:

4:2 somnium vidi, quod perterruit me: et cogitationes meae in strato meo,
et visiones capitis mei conturbaverunt me.

4:3 Et per me propositum est decretum ut introducerentur in conspectu
meo cuncti sapientes Babylonis, et ut solutionem somnii indicarent mihi.

4:4 Tunc ingrediebantur arioli, magi, Chaldaei, et aruspices,
et somnium narravi in conspectu eorum: et solutionem eius non
indicaverunt mihi:

4:5 donec collega ingressus est in conspectu meo Daniel, cui nomen
Baltassar secundum nomen Dei mei, qui habet spiritum deorum sanctorum
in semetipso: et somnium coram ipso locutus sum.

4:6 Baltassar princeps ariolorum, quoniam ego scio quod spiritum
sanctorum deorum habeas in te, et omne sacramentum non est impossibile
tibi: visiones somniorum meorum, quas vidi, et solutionem earum narra.

4:7 Visio capitis mei in cubili meo: Videbam, et ecce arbor in
medio terrae, et altitudo eius nimia.

4:8 Magna arbor, et fortis: et proceritas eius contingens caelum:
aspectus illius erat usque ad terminos universae terrae.

4:9 Folia eius pulcherrima, et fructus eius nimius: et esca universorum
in ea. subter eam habitabant animalia, et bestiae, et in ramis eius
conversabantur volucres caeli: et ex ea vescebatur omnis caro.

4:10 Videbam in visione capitis mei super stratum meum, et ecce vigil,
et sanctus de caelo descendit.

4:11 Clamavit fortiter, et sic ait: Succidite arborem, et praecidite
ramos eius: excutite folia eius, et dispergite fructus eius:
fugiant bestiae, quae subter eam sunt, et volucres de ramis eius.

4:12 Verumtamen germen radicum eius in terra sinite, et alligetur
vinculo ferreo et aereo in herbis, quae foris sunt, et rore caeli tingatur,
et cum feris pars eius in herba terrae.

4:13 Cor eius ab humano commutetur, et cor ferae detur ei:
et septem tempora mutentur super eum.

4:14 In sententia vigilum decretum est, et sermo sanctorum, et petitio:
donec cognoscant viventes quoniam dominatur Excelsus in regno hominum;
et cuicumque voluerit, dabit illud, et humillimum hominem constituet
super eum.

4:15 Hoc somnium vidi ego Nabuchodonosor rex: tu ergo Baltassar
interpretationem narra festinus: quia omnes sapientes regni mei
non queunt solutionem edicere mihi: tu autem potes, quia spiritus
deorum sanctorum in te est.

4:16 Tunc Daniel, cuius nomen Baltassar, coepit intra semetipsum
tacitus cogitare quasi una hora: et cogitationes eius conturbabant eum.
Respondens autem rex ait: Baltassar, somnium et interpretatio eius non
conturbent te.  Respondit Baltassar, et dixit: Domine mi, somnium his,
qui te oderunt, et interpretatio eius hostibus tuis sit.

4:17 Arborem, quam vidisti sublimem, atque robustam, cuius altitudo
pertingit ad caelum, et aspectus illius in omnem terram:

4:18 et rami eius pulcherrimi, et fructus eius nimius, et esca omnium in ea,
subter eam habitantes bestiae agri, et in ramis eius commorantes aves caeli:

4:19 Tu es rex, qui magnificatus es, et invaluisti: et magnitudo tua crevit,
et pervenit usque ad caelum, et potestas tua in terminos universae terrae.

4:20 Quod autem vidit rex vigilem, et sanctum descendere de caelo,
et dicere: Succidite arborem, et dissipate illam, attamen germen
radicum eius in terra dimittite, et vinciatur ferro et aere in
herbis foris, et rore caeli conspergatur, et cum feris sit pabulum eius,
donec septem tempora mutentur super eum:

4:21 Haec est interpretatio sententiae Altissimi, quae pervenit
super dominum meum regem:

4:22 Eiicient te ab hominibus, et cum bestiis ferisque erit habitatio tua,
et (d) foenum ut bos comedes, et rore caeli infunderis: septem quoque
tempora mutabuntur super te, donec scias quod dominetur Excelsus super
regnum hominum, et cuicumque voluerit, det illud.

4:23 Quod autem praecepit ut relinqueretur germen radicum eius,
id est arboris: regnum tuum tibi manebit postquam cognoveris
potestatem esse caelestem.

4:24 Quam ob rem rex consilium meum placeat tibi, (e) et peccata
tua eleemosynis redime, et iniquitates tuas misericordiis pauperum:
forsitan ignoscet delictis tuis.

4:25 Omnia haec venerunt super Nabuchodonosor regem.

4:26 Post finem mensium duodecim, in aula Babylonis deambulabat.

4:27 Responditque rex, et ait: Nonne haec est Babylon magna,
quam ego aedificavi in domum regni, in robore fortitudinis meae,
et in gloria decoris mei?

4:28 Cumque sermo adhuc esset in ore regis, vox de caelo ruit:
Tibi dicitur Nabuchodonosor rex: Regnum tuum transibit a te,

4:29 et ab hominibus eiicient te, et cum bestiis et feris erit
habitatio tua: foenum quasi bos comedes, et septem tempora mutabuntur
super te, donec scias quod dominetur Excelsus in regno hominum,
et cuicumque voluerit, det illud.

4:30 Eadem hora sermo completus est super Nabuchodonosor, et ex
hominibus abiectus est, et foenum ut bos comedit, et rore caeli
corpus eius infectum est: donec capilli eius in similitudinem
aquilarum crescerent, et ungues eius quasi avium.

4:31 Igitur post finem dierum ego Nabuchodonosor oculos meos
ad caelum levavi, et sensus meus redditus est mihi: et Altissimo
benedixi, et viventem in sempiternum laudavi, et glorificavi:
(f) quia potestas eius potestas sempiterna, et regnum eius in
generationem et generationem.

4:32 Et omnes habitatores terrae apud eum in nihilum reputati sunt:
iuxta voluntatem enim suam facit tam in virtutibus caeli quam in
habitatoribus terrae: et non est qui resistat manui eius, et dicat ei:
Quare fecisti?

4:33 In ipso tempore sensus meus reversus est ad me, et ad honorem
regni mei, decoremque perveni: et figura mea reversa est ad me:
et optimates mei, et magistratus mei requisierunt me, et in regno
meo restitutus sum: et magnificentia amplior addita est mihi.

4:34 Nunc igitur ego Nabuchodonosor laudo, et magnifico, et glorifico
regem caeli: quia omnia opera eius vera, et viae eius iudicia,
et gradientes in superbia potest humiliare.




4. BALTASSAR REGNO ET VITA PRIVATUR, 5:1-31.


5:1 Baltassar rex fecit grande convivium optimatibus suis mille:
et unusquisque secundum suam bibebat aetatem.

5:2 Praecepit ergo iam temulentus ut afferrentur vasa aurea et argentea,
quae asportaverat Nabuchodonosor pater eius de templo, quod fuit
in Ierusalem, ut biberent in eis rex, et optimates eius, uxoresque eius,
et concubinae.

5:3 Tunc allata sunt vasa aurea, et argentea, quae asportaverat de templo,
quod fuerat in Ierusalem: et biberunt in eis rex, et optimates eius,
uxores et concubinae illius.

5:4 Bibebant vinum, et laudabant deos suos aureos, et argenteos,
aereos, ferreos, ligneosque et lapideos.

5:5 In eadem hora apparuerunt digiti, quasi manus hominis scribentis
contra candelabrum in superficie parietis aulae regiae: et rex
aspiciebat articulos manus scribentis.

5:6 Tunc facies regis commutata est, et cogitationes eius conturbabant eum:
et compages renum eius solvebantur, et genua eius ad seinvicem collidebantur.

5:7 Exclamavit itaque rex fortiter ut introducerent magos, Chaldaeos,
et aruspices.  Et proloquens rex ait sapientibus Babylonis:
Quicumque legerit scripturam hanc, et interpretationem eius
manifestam mihi fecerit, purpura vestietur, et torquem auream
habebit in collo, et tertius in regno meo erit.

5:8 Tunc ingressi omnes sapientes regis non potuerunt nec
scripturam legere, nec interpretationem indicare regi.

5:9 Unde rex Baltassar satis conturbatus est, et vultus illius
immutatus est. sed et optimates eius turbabantur.

5:10 Regina autem pro re, quae acciderat regi, et optimatibus eius,
domum convivii ingressa est: et proloquens ait: Rex in aeternum vive:
non te conturbent cogitationes tuae, neque facies tua immutetur.

5:11 Est vir in regno tuo, qui spiritum deorum sanctorum habet in se:
et in diebus patris tui scientia et sapientia inventae sunt in eo:
nam et rex Nabuchodonosor pater tuus principem magorum, incantatorum,
Chaldaeorum, et aruspicum constituit eum, pater, inquam, tuus, o rex:

5:12 quia spiritus amplior, et prudentia, intelligentiaque et
interpretatio somniorum, et ostensio secretorum, ac solutio ligatorum
inventae sunt in eo, hoc est in Daniele: cui rex posuit nomen Baltassar.
nunc itaque Daniel vocetur, et interpretationem narrabit.

5:13 Igitur introductus est Daniel coram rege.  Ad quem praefatus
rex ait: Tu es Daniel de filiis captivitatis Iudae, quem adduxit
pater meus rex de Iudaea?

5:14 Audivi de te quoniam spiritum deorum habeas: et scientia,
intelligentiaque ac sapientia ampliores inventae sunt in te.

5:15 Et nunc introgressi sunt in conspectu meo sapientes magi,
ut scripturam hanc legerent, et interpretationem eius indicarent mihi:
et nequiverunt sensum huius sermonis edicere.

5:16 Porro ego audivi de te, quod possis obscura interpretari,
et ligata dissolvere: si ergo vales scripturam legere, et interpretationem
eius indicare mihi, purpura vestieris, et torquem auream circa
collum tuum habebis, et tertius in regno meo princeps eris.

5:17 Ad quae respondens Daniel, ait coram rege: Munera tua sint tibi,
et dona domus tuae alteri da: scripturam autem legam tibi, rex,
et interpretationem eius ostendam tibi.

5:18 O rex, Deus altissimus regnum, et magnificentiam, gloriam,
et honorem dedit Nabuchodonosor patri tuo.

5:19 Et propter magnificentiam, quam dederat ei, universi populi,
tribus, et linguae tremebant, et metuebant eum: quos volebat,
interficiebat: et quos volebat, percutiebat: et quos volebat, exaltabat:
et quos volebat, humiliabat.

5:20 Quando autem elevatum est cor eius, et spiritus illius obfirmatus est
ad superbiam, depositus est de solio regni sui, et gloria eius ablata est:

5:21 (g) et a filiis hominum eiectus est, sed et cor eius cum bestiis
positum est, et cum onagris erat habitatio eius: foenum quoque ut
bos comedebat, et rore caeli corpus eius infectum est, donec
cognosceret quod potestatem haberet Altissimus in regno hominum:
et quemcumque voluerit, suscitabit super illud.

5:22 Tu quoque filius eius Baltassar, non humiliasti cor tuum,
cum scires haec omnia:

5:23 sed adversum Dominatorem caeli elevatus es: et vasa domus
eius allata sunt coram te: et tu, et optimates tui, et uxores tuae,
et concubinae tuae vinum bibistis in eis: deos quoque argenteos,
et aureos, et aereos, ferreos, ligneosque et lapideos, qui non vident,
neque audiunt, neque sentiunt, laudasti: porro Deum, qui habet
flatum tuum in manu sua, et omnes vias tuas, non glorificasti.

5:24 Idcirco ab eo missus est articulus manus, quae scripsit hoc,
quod exaratum est.

5:25 Haec est autem scriptura, quae digesta est: MANE, THECEL, PHARES.

5:26 Et haec est interpretatio sermonis.  MANE: numeravit Deus
regnum tuum, et complevit illud.

5:27 THECEL: appensus es in statera, et inventus es minus habens.

5:28 PHARES: divisum est regnum tuum, et datum est Medis, et Persis.

5:29 Tunc iubente rege indutus est Daniel purpura, et circumdata
est torques aurea collo eius: et praedicatum est de eo quod haberet
potestatem tertius in regno suo.

5:30 Eadem nocte interfectus est Baltassar rex Chaldaeus.

5:31 Et Darius Medus successit in regnum annos natus sexagintaduos.



5. DANIEL IN LACU LEONUM SERVATUR, 6:1-28.


6:1 Placuit Dario, et constituit super regnum satrapas centum
viginti ut essent in toto regno suo.

6:2 Et super eos principes tres, ex quibus Daniel unus erat:
ut satrapae illis redderent rationem, et rex non sustineret molestiam.

6:3 Igitur Daniel superabat omnes principes, et satrapas:
quia spiritus Dei amplior erat in illo.

6:4 Porro rex cogitabat constituere eum super omne regnum:
unde principes, et satrapae quaerebant occasionem ut invenirent
Danieli ex latere regis: nullamque causam, et suspicionem
reperire potuerunt, eo quod fidelis esset, et omnis culpa,
et suspicio non inveniretur in eo.

6:5 Dixerunt ergo viri illi: Non inveniemus Danieli huic
aliquam occasionem, nisi forte in lege Dei sui.

6:6 Tunc principes, et satrapae surripuerunt regi, et sic locuti
sunt ei: Dari rex in aeternum vive:

6:7 consilium inierunt omnes principes regni tui, magistratus,
et satrapae, senatores, et iudices ut decretum imperatorium exeat,
et edictum: Ut omnis, qui petierit aliquam petitionem a quocumque deo,
et homine usque ad triginta dies, nisi a te rex, mittatur in lacum leonum.

6:8 Nunc itaque rex confirma sententiam, et scribe decretum:
ut non immutetur quod statutum est a Medis et Persis,
nec praevaricari cuiquam liceat.

6:9 Porro rex Darius proposuit edictum, et statuit.

6:10 Quod cum Daniel comperisset, id est, constitutam legem,
ingressus est domum suam: et fenestris apertis in coenaculo suo contra
Ierusalem tribus temporibus in die flectebat genua sua, et adorabat,
confitebaturque coram Deo suo sicut et ante facere consueverat.

6:11 Viri ergo illi curiosius inquirentes invenerunt Danielem orantem,
et obscerantem Deum suum.

6:12 Et accedentes locuti sunt regi super edicto: Rex numquid non
constituisti, ut omnis homo, qui rogaret quemquam de diis,
et hominibus usque ad dies triginta, nisi te, rex, mitteretur
in lacum leonum?  Ad quos respondens rex, ait: verus est sermo
iuxta decretum Medorum, atque Persarum, quod praevaricari non licet.

6:13 Tunc respondentes dixerunt coram rege: Daniel de filiis
captivitatis Iuda, non curavit de lege tua, et de edicto,
quod constituisti: sed tribus temporibus per diem orat obsecratione sua.

6:14 Quod verbum cum audisset rex, satis contristatus est:
et pro Daniele posuit cor ut liberaret eum, et usque ad occasum
solis laborabat ut erueret illum.

6:15 Viri autem illi intelligentes regem dixerunt ei: Scito rex,
quia lex Medorum, atque Persarum est ut omne decretum,
quod constituerit rex, non liceat immutari.

6:16 Tunc rex praecepit: et adduxerunt Danielem, et miserunt eum
in lacum leonum.  Dixitque rex Danieli: Deus tuus, quem colis semper,
ipse liberabit te.

6:17 Allatusque est lapis unus, et positus est super os laci:
quem obsignavit rex annulo suo, et annulo optimatum suorum,
nequid fieret contra Danielem.

6:18 Et abiit rex in domum suam, et dormivit incoenatus, cibique
non sunt allati coram eo, insuper et somnus recessit ab eo.

6:19 Tunc rex primo diluculo consurgens, festinus ad lacum leonum perrexit:

6:20 appropinquansque lacui, Danielem voce lacrymabili inclamavit,
et affatus est eum: Daniel serve Dei viventis, Deus tuus,
cui tu servis semper, putasne valuit te liberare a leonibus?

6:21 Et Daniel regi respondens ait: Rex in aeternum vive:

6:22 (h) Deus meus misit angelum suum, et conclusit ora leonum,
et non nocuerunt mihi: quia coram eo iustitia inventa est in me:
sed et coram te, rex, delictum non feci.

6:23 Tunc vehementer rex gavisus est super eo, et Danielem
praecepit educi de lacu: eductusque est Daniel de lacu,
et nulla laesio inventa est in eo, quia credidit Deo suo.

6:24 Iubente autem rege, adducti sunt viri illi, qui accusaverant
Danielem: et in lacum leonum missi sunt, ipsi, et filii,
et uxores eorum: et non pervenerunt usque ad pavimentum laci,
donec arriperent eos leones, et omnia ossa eorum comminuerunt.

6:25 Tunc Darius rex scripsit universis populis, tribubus,
et linguis habitantibus in universa terra: PAX vobis multiplicetur.

6:26 A me constitutum est decretum, ut in universo imperio,
et regno meo tremiscant, et paveant Deum Danielis. ipse est enim
Deus vivens, et aeternus in saecula: et regnum eius non dissipabitur,
et potestas eius usque in aeternum.

6:27 Ipse liberator, atque salvator, faciens signa, et mirabilia
in caelo, et in terra: qui liberavit Danielem de lacu leonum.

6:28 (i) Porro Daniel perseveravit usque ad regnum Darii,
regnumque Cyri Persae.





PARS ALTERA.
VISIONES DANIELIS PROPHETAE, 7:1-12:13.




1. DE QUATTUOR REGNIS MUNDI AC DE REGNO MESSIANICO, 7:1-28.


7:1 Anno primo Baltassar regis Babylonis, Daniel somnium vidit:
visio autem capitis eius in cubili suo: et somnium scribens,
brevi sermone comprehendit: summatimque perstringens, ait:

7:2 Videbam in visione mea nocte, et ecce quattuor venti caeli
pugnabant in mari magno.

7:3 Et quattuor bestiae grandes ascendebant de mari diversae inter se.

7:4 Prima quasi leaena, et alas habebat aquilae: aspiciebam donec
evulsae sunt alae eius, et sublata est de terra, et super pedes quasi
homo stetit; et cor hominis datum est ei.

7:5 Et ecce bestia alia similis urso in parte stetit: et tres
ordines erant in ore eius, et in dentibus eius, et sic dicebant ei:
Surge, comede carnes plurimas.

7:6 Post haec aspiciebam, et ecce alia quasi pardus, et alas
habebat quasi avis, quattuor super se, et quattuor capita erant
in bestia, et potestas data est ei.

7:7 Post haec aspiciebam in visione noctis, et ecce bestia
quarta terribilis, atque mirabilis, et fortis nimis,
dentes ferreos habebat magnos, comedens atque comminuens,
et reliqua pedibus suis conculcans: dissimilis autem erat
ceteris bestiis, quas videram ante eam, et habebat cornua decem.

7:8 Considerabam cornua, et ecce cornu aliud parvulum ortum est de medio
eorum: et tria de cornibus primis evulsa sunt a facie eius: et ecce oculi,
quasi oculi hominis erant in cornu isto, et os loquens ingentia.

7:9 Aspiciebam donec throni positi sunt, et antiquus dierum sedit:
vestimentum eius candidum quasi nix, et capilli capitis eius quasi
lana munda: thronus eius flammae ignis: rotae eius ignis accensus.

7:10 Fluvius igneus, rapidusque egrediebatur a facie eius.
(j) millia millium ministrabant ei, et decies millies centena
millia assistebant ei: iudicium sedit, et libri aperti sunt.

7:11 Aspiciebam propter vocem sermonum grandium, quos cornu
illud loquebatur: et vidi quoniam interfecta esset bestia,
et perisset corpus eius, et traditum esset ad comburendum igni:

7:12 aliarum quoque bestiarum ablata esset potestas, et tempora
vitae constituta essent eis usque ad tempus, et tempus.

7:13 Aspiciebam ergo in visione noctis, et ecce cum nubibus caeli
quasi filius hominis veniebat, et usque ad antiquum dierum pervenit:
et in conspectu eius obtulerunt eum.

7:14 Et dedit ei potestatem, et honorem, et regnum: et omnes populi,
tribus, et linguae ipsi servient: (k) potestas eius, potestas aeterna,
quae non auferetur: et regnum eius, quod non corrumpetur.

7:15 Horruit spiritus meus, ego Daniel territus sum in his,
et visiones capitis mei conturbaverunt me.

7:16 Accessi ad unum de assistentibus, et veritatem quaerebam ab eo
de omnibus his.  Qui dixit mihi interpretationem sermonum, et docuit me:

7:17 Hae quattuor bestiae magnae: quattuor sunt regna,
quae consurgent de terra.

7:18 Suscipient autem regnum sancti Dei altissimi: et obtinebunt
regnum usque in saeculum, et saeculum saeculorum.

7:19 Post hoc volui diligenter discere de bestia quarta,
quae erat dissimilis valde ab omnibus, et terribilis nimis:
dentes et ungues eius ferrei: comedebat, et comminuebat,
et reliqua pedibus suis conculcabat:

7:20 et de cornibus decem, quae habebat in capite: et de alio,
quod ortum fuerat, ante quod ceciderant tria cornua: et de cornu illo,
quod habebat oculos, et os loquens grandia, et maius erat ceteris.

7:21 Aspiciebam, et ecce cornu illud faciebat bellum adversus sanctos,
et praevalebat eis,

7:22 donec venit antiquus dierum, et iudicium dedit sanctis Excelsi,
et tempus advenit, et regnum obtinuerunt sancti.

7:23 Et sic ait: Bestia quarta, regnum quartum erit in terra,
quod maius erit omnibus regnis, et devorabit universam terram,
et conculcabit, et comminuet eam.

7:24 Porro cornua decem ipsius regni, decem reges erunt:
et alius consurget post eos, et ipse potentior erit prioribus,
et tres reges humiliabit.

7:25 Et sermones contra Excelsum loquetur, et sanctos Altissimi
conteret: et putabit quod possit mutare tempora, et leges,
et tradentur in manu eius usque ad tempus, et tempora, et dimidium temporis.

7:26 Et iudicium sedebit ut auferatur potentia, et conteratur,
et dispereat usque in finem.

7:27 Regnum autem, et potestas, et magnitudo regni, quae est subter
omne caelum, detur populo sanctorum Altissimi: cuius regnum,
regnum sempiternum est, et omnes reges servient ei, et obedient.

7:28 Hucusque finis verbi.  Ego Daniel multum cogitationibus
meis conturbabar, et facies mea mutata est in me: verbum autem
in corde meo conservavi.



2. DE VICTORIA GRAECORUM ET IMPIETATE REGIS ULTIMI, 8:1-27.


8:1 Anno tertio regni Baltassar regis, visio apparuit mihi.
Ego Daniel post id, quod videram in principio,

8:2 vidi in visione mea, cum essem in Susis castro, quod est in
Aelam regione: vidi autem in visione esse me super portam Ulai.

8:3 Et lavavi oculus meos, et vidi: et ecce aries unus stabat
ante paludem, habens cornua excelsa, et unum excelsius altero
atque succrescens.  Postea

8:4 vidi arietem cornibus ventilantem contra Occidentem,
et contra Aquilonem, et contra Meridiem, et omnes bestiae
non poterant resistere ei, neque liberari de manu eius:
fecitque secundum voluntatem suam, et magnificatus est.

8:5 Et ego intelligebam: ecce autem hircus caprarum veniebat ab
Occidente super faciem totius terrae, et non tangebat terram:
porro hircus habebat cornu insigne inter oculos suos.

8:6 Et venit usque ad arietem illum cornutum, quem videram stantem
ante portam, et cucurrit ad eum in impetu fortitudinis suae.

8:7 Cumque appropinquasset prope arietem, efferatus est in eum,
et percussit arietem: et comminuit duo cornua eius, et non poterat
aries resistere ei: cumque eum misisset in terram, conculcavit,
et nemo quibat liberare arietem de manu eius.

8:8 Hircus autem caprarum magnus factus est nimis: cumque crevisset,
fractum est cornu magnum, et orta sunt quattour cornua subter illud
per quattuor ventos caeli.

8:9 De uno autem ex eis egressum est cornu unum modicum: et factum
est grande contra Meridiem, et contra Orientem, et contra fortitudinem.

8:10 Et magnificatum est usque ad fortitudinem caeli: et deiecit de
fortitudine, et de stellis, et conculcavit eas.

8:11 Et usque ad principem fortitudinis magnificatum est: et ab eo
tulit iuge sacrificium, et deiecit locum sanctificationis eius.

8:12 Robur autem datum est ei contra iuge sacrificium propter peccata:
et prosternetur veritas in terra, et faciet, et prosperabitur.

8:13 Et audivi unum de sanctis loquentem: et dixit unus sanctus
alteri nescio cui loquenti: Usquequo visio, et iuge sacrificium,
et peccatum desolationis, quae facta est: et sanctuarium,
et fortitudo conculcabitur?

8:14 Et dixit ei: Usque ad vesperam at mane, dies duo millia trecenti:
et mundabitur sanctuarium.

8:15 Factum est autem cum viderem ego Daniel visionem, et quaererem
intelligentiam: ecce stetit in conspectu meo quasi species viri.

8:16 Et audivi vocem viri inter Ulai: et clamavit, et ait:
Gabriel fac intelligere istum visionem.

8:17 Et venit, et stetit iuxta ubi ego stabam: cumque venisset,
pavens corrui in faciem meam, et ait ad me:  Intellige fili hominis,
quoniam in tempore finis complebitur visio.

8:18 Cumque loqueretur ad me, collapsus sum pronus in terram:
et tetigit me, et statuit me in gradu meo,

8:19 dixitque mihi: Ego ostendam tibi quae futura sunt in
novissimo maledictionis: quoniam habet tempus finem suum.

8:20 Aries, quem vidisti habere cornua, rex Medorum est atque Persarum.

8:21 Porro hircus caprarum, rex Graecorum est. et cornu grande,
quod erat inter oculos eius, ipse est rex primus.

8:22 Quod autem fracto illo surrexerunt quattuor pro eo:
quattuor reges de gente eius consurgent, sed non in fortitudine eius.

8:23 Et post regnum eorum, cum creverint iniquitates, consurget
rex impundes facie, et intelligens propositiones.

8:24 et roborabitur fortitudo eius, sed non in viribus suis:
et supra quam credi potest, universa vastabit, et prosperabitur, et faciet.
Et interficiet robustos, et populum sanctorum

8:25 secundum voluntatem suam, et dirigetur dolus in manu eius:
et cor suum magnificabit, et in copia rerum omnium occidet plurimos:
et contra principem principum consurget, et sine manu conteretur.

8:26 Et visio vespere et mane, quae dicta est, vera est:
tu ergo visionem signa, quia post multos dies erit.

8:27 Et ego Daniel langui, et aegrotavi per dies: cumque surrexissem,
faciebam opera regis, et stupebam ad visionem, et non erat qui
interpretaretur.



3. DE TEMPORE ADVENTUS CHRISTI ET REGNI MESSIANICI, 9:1-27.


9:1 In anno primo Darii filii Assueri de semine Medorum,
qui imperavit super regnum Chaldaeorum:

9:2 Anno uno regni eius, ego Daniel intellexi in libris (l) numerum
annorum, de quo factus est sermo Domini ad Ieremiam prophetam,
ut complerentur desolationis Ierusalem septuaginta anni.

9:3 Et posui faciem meam ad Dominum Deum meum rogare et deprecari
in ieiuniis, sacco, et cinere.

9:4 Et oravi Dominum Deum meum, et confessus sum, et dixi:
(m) Obsecro Domine Deus magne et terribilis, custodiens pactum,
et misericordiam diligentibus te, et custodientibus mandata tua.

9:5 (n) Peccavimus, iniquitatem fecimus, impie egimus, et recessimus:
et declinavimus a mandatis tuis, ac iudiciis.

9:6 Non obedivimus servis tuis prophetis, qui locuti sunt in
nomine tuo regibus nostris, principibus nostris, patribus nostris,
omnique populo terrae.

9:7 Tibi Domine iustitia: nobis autem confusio faciei, sicut est
hodie viro Iuda, et habitatoribus Ierusalem, et omni Israel,
his qui prope sunt, et his qui procul in universis terris, ad quas
eiecisti eos propter iniquitates eorum, in quibus peccaverunt in te.

9:8 Domine nobis confusio faciei, regibus nostris, principibus nostris,
et patribus nostris, qui peccaverunt.

9:9 Tibi autem Domino Deo nostro misericordia, et propitiatio,
quia recessimus a te:

9:10 et non audivimus vocem Domini Dei nostri ut ambularemus in lege eius,
quam posuit nobis per servos suos prophetas.

9:11 Et omnis Israel praevaricati sunt legem tuam, et declinaverunt
ne audirent vocem tuam, et stillavit super nos maledictio, et detestatio,
(o) quae scripta est in libro Moysi servi Dei, quia peccavimus ei.

9:12 Et statuit sermones suos, quos locutus est super nos,
et super principes nostros, qui iudicaverunt nos, ut superinduceret
in nos magnum malum, quale numquam fuit sub omni caelo,
secundum quod factum est in Ierusalem.

9:13 Sicut scriptum est in lege Moysi, omne malum hoc venit super nos:
et non rogavimus faciem tuam Domine Deus noster, ut reverteremur ab
iniquitatibus nostris, et cogitaremus veritatem tuam.

9:14 Et vigilavit Dominus super malitiam, et adduxit eam super nos:
iustus Dominus Deus noster in omnibus operibus suis, quae fecit:
non enim audivimus vocem eius.

9:15 (p) Et nunc Domine Deus noster, (q) qui eduxisti populum tuum
de Terra Aegypti in manu forti, et fecisti tibi nomen secundum diem hanc:
peccavimus, iniquitatem fecimus.

9:16 Domine in omnem iustitiam tuam: avertatur obsecro ira tua,
et furor tuus a civitate tua Ierusalem, et monte sancto tuo.
Propter peccata enim nostra, et iniquitates patrum nostrorum, Ierusalem,
et populus tuus in opprobrium sunt omnibus per circuitum nostrum.

9:17 Nunc ergo exaudi Deus noster orationem servi tui,
et preces eius: et ostende faciem tuam super sanctuarium tuum,
quod desertum est propter temetipsum.

9:18 Inclina Deus meus aurem tuam, et audi: aperi oculos tuos,
et vide desolationem nostram, et civitatem, super quam invocatum
est nomen tuum: neque enim in iustificationibus nostris prosternimus
preces ante faciem tuam, sed in miserationibus tuis multis:

9:19 Exaudi Domine, placare Domine: attende et fac: ne moreris propter
temetipsum Deus meus: quia nomen tuum invocatum est super civitatem,
et super populum tuum.

9:20 Cumque adhuc loquerer, et orarem, et confiterer peccata mea,
et peccata populi mei Israel, et prosternerem preces meas in conspectu
Dei mei, pro monte sancto Dei mei:

9:21 Adhuc me loquente in oratione, ecce vir Gabriel, quem videram in
visione a principio, cito volans tetigit me in tempore sacrificii vespertini.

9:22 Et docuit me, et locutus est mihi, dixitque: Daniel nunc
egressus sum ut docerem te, et intelligeres.

9:23 Ab exordio precum tuarum egressus est sermo: ego autem veni ut
indicarem tibi, quia vir desideriorum es: tu ergo animadverte sermonem,
et intellige visionem.

9:24 (r) Septuaginta hebdomades abbreviatae sunt super populum tuum,
et super urbem sanctam tuam ut consummetur praevaricatio, et finem
accipiat peccatum, et deleatur iniquitas, et adducatur iustitia sempiterna,
et impleatur visio, et prophetia, et ungatur Sanctus sanctorum.

9:25 Scito ergo, et animadverte: Ab exitu sermonis, ut iterum
aedificetur Ierusalem, usque ad Christum ducem, hebdomades septem,
et hebdomades sexaginta duae erunt: et rursum aedificabitur platea,
et muri in angustia temporum.

9:26 Et post hebdomades sexaginta duas occidetur Christus:
et non erit eius populus, qui eum negaturus est.  Et civitatem,
et sanctuarium dissipabit populus cum duce venturo: et finis
eius vastitas, et post finem belli statuta desolatio.

9:27 Confirmabit autem pactum multis hebdomada una: et in dimidio
hebdomadis deficiet hostia et sacrificium: (s) et erit in templo
abominatio desolationis: et usque ad consummationem et finem
perseverabit desolatio.



4. DE EVENTIBUS A CYRO USQUE AD FINEM MUNDI, 10:1-12:13.


10:1 Anno tertio Cyri regis Persarum, verbum revelatum est Danieli
cognomento Baltassar, et verbum verum, et fortitudo magna:
intellexitque sermonem: intelligentia enim est opus in visione.

10:2 In diebus illis ego Daniel lugebam trium hebdomadarum diebus,

10:3 panem desiderabilem non comedi, et caro et vinum non introierunt
in os meum, sed neque unguento unctus sum: donec complerentur trium
hebdomadarum dies.

10:4 Die autem vigesima et quarta mensis primi eram iuxta fluvium
magnum, qui est Tigris.

10:5 Et levavi oculos meos, et vidi: et ecce vir unus vestitus lineis,
et renes eius accincti auro obrizo:

10:6 et corpus eius quasi chrysolithus, et facies eius velut species
fulguris, et oculi eius ut lampas ardens: et brachia eius, et quae
deorsum sunt usque ad pedes, quasi species aeris candentis:
et vox sermonum eius ut vox multitudinis.

10:7 Vidi autem ego Daniel solus visionem: porro viri, qui erant mecum,
non viderunt: sed terror nimus irruit super eos, et fugerunt in absconditum.

10:8 Ego autem relictus solus vidi visionem grandem hanc: et non
remansit in me fortitudo, sed et species mea immutata est in me,
et emarcui, nec habui quidquam virium.

10:9 Et audivi vocem sermonum eius: et audiens iacebam consternatus
super faciem meam, et vultus meus haerebat terrae.

10:10 Et ecce manus tetigit me, et erexit me super genua mea,
et super articulos manuum mearum.

10:11 Et dixit ad me: Daniel vir desideriorum, intellige verba,
quae ego loquor ad te, et sta in gradu tuo: nunc enim sum missus ad te.
Cumque dixisset mihi sermonem istum, steti tremens.

10:12 Et ait ad me: Noli metuere Daniel: quia ex die primo,
quo posuisti cor tuum ad intelligendum ut te affligeres in conspectu
Dei tui, exaudita sunt verba tua: et ego veni propter sermones tuos.

10:13 Princeps autem regni Persarum restitit mihi viginti et uno diebus:
et ecce Michael unus de principibus primis venit in adiutorium meum,
et ego remansi ibi iuxta regem Persarum.

10:14 Veni autem ut docerem te quae ventura sunt populo tuo in
novissimis diebus, quoniam adhuc, visio in dies.

10:15 Cumque loqueretur mihi huiuscemodi verbis, deieci vultum
meum ad terram, et tacui.

10:16 Et ecce quasi similitudo filii hominis tetigit labia mea:
et aperiens os meum locutus sum, et dixi ad eum, qui stabat contra me:
Domine mi, in visione tua dissolutae sunt compages meae, et nihil
in me remansit virium.

10:17 Et quomodo poterit servus Domini mei loqui cum Domino meo?
nihil enim in me remansit virium, sed et halitus meus intercluditur.

10:18 Rursum ergo tetigit me quasi visio hominis, et confortavit me,

10:19 et dixit: Noli timere vir desideriorum: pax tibi: confortare,
et esto robustus.  Cumque loqueretur mecum, convalui, et dixi:
Loquere Domine mi, quia confortasti me.

10:20 Et ait: Numquid scis quare venerim ad te? et nunc revertar
ut praelier adversum principem Persarum. cum ego egrederer,
apparuit princeps Graecorum veniens.

10:21 Verumtamen annunciabo tibi quod expressum est in scriptura veritatis:
et nemo est adiutor meus in omnibus his, nisi Michael princeps vester.

11:1 Ego autem ab anno primo Darii Medi stabam ut confortaretur,
et roboraretur.

11:2 Et nunc veritatem annunciabo tibi.  Ecce adhuc tres reges
stabunt in Perside, et quartus ditabitur opibus nimiis super omnes:
et cum invaluerit divitiis suis, concitabit omnes adversum regnum Graeciae.

11:3 Surget vero rex fortis, et dominabitur potestate multa:
et faciet quod placuerit ei.

11:4 Et cum steterit, conteretur regnum eius, et dividetur in
quattuor ventos caeli: sed non in posteros eius, neque secundum
potentiam illius, qua dominatus est. lacerabitur enim regnum eius
etiam in externos, exceptis his.

11:5 Et confortabitur rex Austri: et de principibus eius praevalebit
super eum, et dominabitur ditione: multa enim dominatio eius.

11:6 Et post finem annorum foederabuntur: filiaque regis Austri
veniet ad regem Aquilonis facere amicitiam, et non obtinebit fortitudinem
brachii, nec stabit semen eius: et tradetur ipsa, et qui adduxerunt eam,
adolescentes eius, et qui confortabant eam in temporibus.

11:7 Et stabit de germine radicum eius plantatio: et veniet cum exercitu,
et ingredietur provinciam regis Aquilonis: et abutetur eis, et obtinebit.

11:8 Insuper et deos eorum, et sculptilia, vasa quoque pretiosa argenti,
et auri captiva ducet in Aegyptum: ipse praevalebit adversus regem Aquilonis.

11:9 Et intrabit in regnum rex Austri, et revertetur ad terram suam.

11:10 Filii autem eius provocabuntur, et congregabunt multitudinem
exercituum plurimorum: et veniet properans, et inundans:
et revertetur, et concitabitur, et congredietur cum robere eius.

11:11 Et provocatus rex Austri egredietur, et pugnabit adversus
regem Aquilonis, et praeparabit multitudinem nimiam, et dabitur
multitudo in manu eius.

11:12 Et capiet multitudinem, et exaltabitur cor eius, et deiiciet
multa millia, sed non praevalebit.

11:13 Convertetur enim rex Aquilonis, et praeparabit multitudinem
multo maiorem quam prius: et in fine temporum, annorumque veniet
properans cum exercitu magno, et opibus nimiis.

11:14 (t) Et in temporibus illis multi consurgent adversus regem Austri:
filii quoque praevaricatorum populi tui extollentur ut impleant visionem,
et corruent.

11:15 Et venit rex Aquilonis, et comportabit aggerem, et capiet urbes
munitissimas: et brachia Austri non sustinebunt, et consurgent electi
eius ad resistendum, et non erit fortitudo.

11:16 Et faciet veniens super eum iuxta placitum suum, et non erit
qui stet contra faciem eius: et stabit in terra inclyta, et consumetur
in manu eius.

11:17 Et ponet faciem suam ut veniat ad tenendum universum regnum eius,
et recta faciet cum eo: et filiam feminarum dabit ei, ut evertat illud:
et non stabit, nec illius erit.

11:18 Et convertet faciem suam ad insulas, et capiet multas:
et cessare faciet principem opprobrii sui, et opprobrium eius
convertetur in eum.

11:19 Et convertet faciem suam ad imperium terrae suae, et impinget,
et corruet, et non invenietur.

11:20 Et stabit in loco eius vilissimus, et indignus decore regio:
et in paucis diebus conteretur, non in furore, nec in praelio.

11:21 Et stabit in loco eius despectus, et non tribuetur ei
honor regius: et veniet clam, et obtinebit regnum in fraudulentia.

11:22 Et brachia pugnantis expugnabuntur a facie eius, et conterentur:
insuper et dux foederis.

11:23 Et post amicitias, cum eo faciet dolum: et ascendet,
et superabit in modico populo.

11:24 Et abundantes, et uberes urbes ingredietur: et faciet quae non
fecerunt patres eius, et patres patrum eius: rapinas, et praedam,
et divinitas eorum dissipabit, et contra firmissimas cogitationes inibit:
et hoc usque ad tempus.

11:25 Et concitabitur fortitudo eius, et cor eius adversum regem Austri
in exercitu magno: et rex Austri provocabitur ad bellum multis auxiliis,
et fortibus nimis: et non stabunt, quia inibunt adversus eum consilia.

11:26 Et comedentes panem cum eo, conterent illum, exercitusque eius
opprimetur: et cadent interfecti plurimi.

11:27 Duorum quoque regnum cor erit ut malefaciant, et ad mensam unam
mendacium loquentur, et non proficient: quia adhuc finis in aliud tempus.

11:28 Et revertetur in terram suam cum opibus multis: et cor eius
adversum testamentum sanctum, et faciet, et revertetur in terram suam.

11:29 Statuto tempore revertetur, et veniet ad Austrum:
et non erit priori simile novissimum.

11:30 Et veniet super eum Trieres, et Romani: et percutietur,
et revertetur, et indignabitur contra testamentum sanctuarii,
et faciet: reverteturque et cogitabit adversum eos, qui dereliquerunt
testamentum sanctuarii.

11:31 Et brachia ex eo stabunt, et polluent sanctuarium fortitudinis,
et auferent iuge sacrificium: et dabunt abominationem in desolationem.

11:32 Et impii in testamentum simulabunt fraudulenter:
populus autem sciens Deum suum, obtinebit, et faciet.

11:33 Et docti in populo docebunt plurimos: et ruent in gladio,
et in flamma, et in captivitate, et in rapina dierum.

11:34 Cumque corruerint, sublevabuntur auxilio parvulo:
et applicabuntur eis plurimi fraudulenter.

11:35 Et de eruditis ruent, ut conflentur, et eligantur, et dealbentur
usque ad tempus praefinitum: quia adhuc aliud tempus erit.

11:36 Et faciet iuxta voluntatem suam rex, et elevabitur,
et magnificabitur adversus omnem deum: et adversus Deum deorum
loquetur magnifica, et dirigetur, donec compleatur iracundia:
perpetrata quippe est definitio.

11:37 Et Deum patrum suorum non reputabit: et erit in concupiscentiis
feminarum, nec quemquam deorum curabit: quia adversum universa consurget.

11:38 Deum autem Maozim in loco suo venerabitur: et Deum,
quem ignoraverunt patres eius, colet auro, et argento,
et lapide pretioso, rebusque pretiosis.

11:39 Et faciet ut muniat Maozim cum Deo alieno, quem cognovit,
et multiplicabit gloriam, et dabit eis potestatem in multis,
et terram dividet gratuito.

11:40 Et in tempore praefinito praeliabitur adversus eum rex Austri,
et quasi tempestas veniet contra illum rex Aquilonis in curribus,
et in equitibus, et in classe magna, et ingredietur terras, et conteret,
et pertransiet.

11:41 Et introibit in terram gloriosam, et multae corruent:
hae autem solae salvabuntur de manu eius, Edom, et Moab,
et principium filiorum Ammon.

11:42 Et mittet manum suam in terras: et Terra Aegypti non effugiet.

11:43 Et dominabitur thesaurorum auri, et argenti, et in omnibus
pretiosis Aegypti: per Libyam quoque, et Aethiopiam transibit.

11:44 Et fama turbabit eum ab Oriente et ab Aquilone: et veniet
in multitudine magna ut conterat et interficiat plurimos.

11:45 Et figet tabernaculum suum Apadno inter maria, super montem
inclytum et sanctum: et veniet usque ad summitatem eius, et nemo
auxiliabitur ei.

12:1 In tempore autem illo consurget Michael princeps magnus,
qui stat pro filiis populi tui: et veniet tempus quale non fuit
ab eo ex quo gentes esse coeperunt usque ad tempus illud.
Et in tempore illo salvabitur populus tuus, omnis qui inventus
fuerit scriptus in libro.

12:2 Et multi de his, qui dormiunt in terrae pulvere, evigilabunt:
(u) alii in vitam aeternam, et alii in opprobrium ut videant semper.

12:3 Qui autem docti fuerint, (v) fulgebunt quasi splendor firmamenti:
et qui ad iustitiam erudiunt multos, quasi stellae in perpetuas aeternitates.

12:4 Tu autem Daniel claude sermones, et signa librum usque ad
tempus statutum: plurimi pertransibunt, et multiplex erit scientia.

12:5 Et vidi ego Daniel, et ecce quasi duo alii stabant: unus hinc
super ripam fluminis, et alius inde ex altera ripa fluminis.

12:6 Et dixi viro, qui erat indutus lineis, qui stabat super
aquas fluminis: Usquequo finis horum mirabilium?

12:7 Et audivi virum, qui indutus erat lineis, qui stabat super
aquas fluminis, (w) cum elevasset dexteram et sinistram suam in
caelum, et iurasset per viventem in aeternum, quia in tempus,
et tempora, et dimidium temporis.  Et cum completa fuerit dispersio
manus populi sancti, complebuntur universa haec.

12:8 Et ego audivi, et non intellexi.  Et dixi: Domine mi,
quid erit post haec?

12:9 Et ait: Vade Daniel, quia clausi sunt, signatique sermones
usque ad praefinitum tempus.

12:10 Eligentur, et dealbabuntur, et quasi ignis probabuntur multi:
et impie agent impii, neque intelligent omnes impii, porro docti intelligent.

12:11 Et a tempore cum ablatum fuerit iuge sacrificium, et posita
fuerit abominatio in desolationem, dies mille ducenti nonaginta.

12:12 Beatus, qui expectat, et pervenit usque ad dies mille
trecentos trigintaquinque.

12:13 Tu autem vade ad praefinitum: et requiesces, et stabis in
sorte tua in finem dierum.

APPENDICES LIBRI, 13:1-14:42.




1. AD 2:49, DE LIBERATIONE CASTAE SUSANNAE, 13:1-64.


13:1 Et erat vir habitans in Babylone, et nomen eius Ioakim:

13:2 Et accepit uxorem nomine Susannam, filiam Helciae pulchram nimis,
et timentem Deum:

13:3 parentes enim illius, cum essent iusti, erudierunt filiam
suam secundum legem Moysi.

13:4 Erat autem Ioakim dives valde, et erat ei pomarium vicinum domui suae:
et ad ipsum confluebant Iudaei, eo quod esset honorabilior omnium.

13:5 Et constituti sunt de populo duo senes iudices in illo anno:
de quibus locutus est Dominus: Quia egressa est iniquitas de Babylone
a senioribus iudicibus, qui videbantur regere populum.

13:6 Isti frequentabant domum Ioakim, et veniebant ad eos omnes,
qui habebant iudicia.

13:7 Cum autem populus revertisset per meridiem, ingrediebatur Susanna,
et deambulabat in pomario viri sui.

13:8 Et videbant eam senes quotidie ingredientem, et deambulantem:
et exarserunt in concupiscentiam eius:

13:9 et everterunt sensum suum, et declinaverunt oculos suos ut
non viderent caelum, neque recordarentur iudiciorum iustorum.

13:10 Erant ergo ambo vulnerati amore eius, nec indicaverunt sibi
vicissim dolorem suum:

13:11 erubescebant enim indicare sibi concupiscentiam suam,
volentes concumbere cum ea:

13:12 et observabant quotidie solicitius videre eam.
Dixitque alter ad alterum:

13:13 Eamus domum, quia hora prandii est.  Et egressi recesserunt a se.

13:14 Cumque revertissent, venerunt in unum: et sciscitantes ab
invicem causam, confessi sunt concupiscentiam suam: et tunc in
communi statuerunt tempus, quando eam possent invenire solam.

13:15 Factum est autem, cum observarent diem aptum, ingressa est
aliquando sicut heri et nudiustertius, cum duabus solis puellis,
voluitque lavari in pomario: aestus quippe erat:

13:16 et non erat ibi quisquam, praeter duos senes absconditos,
et contemplantes eam.

13:17 Dixit ergo puellis: Afferte mihi oleum, et smigmata,
et ostia pomarii claudite, ut laver.

13:18 Et fecerunt sicut praeceperat: clauseruntque ostia pomarii,
et egressae sunt per posticum ut afferrent quae iusserat.
nesciebantque senes intus esse absconditos.

13:19 Cum autem egressae essent puellae, surrexerunt duo senes,
et accurrerunt ad eam, et dixerunt:

13:20 Ecce ostia pomarii clausa sunt, et nemo nos videt,
et nos in concupiscentia tui sumus: quam ob rem assentire nobis,
et commiscere nobiscum.

13:21 quod si nolueris, dicemus contra te testimonium,
quod fuerit tecum iuvenis, et ob hanc causam emiseris puellas a te.

13:22 Ingemuit Susanna, et ait: Angustiae sunt mihi undique: si enim
hoc egero, mors mihi est: si autem non egero, non effugiam manus vestras.

13:23 Sed melius est mihi absque opere incidere in manus vestras,
quam peccare in conspectu Domini.

13:24 Et exclamavit voce magna Susanna: exclamaverunt autem et senes
adversus eam.

13:25 Et cucurrit unus ad ostia pomarii, et aperuit.

13:26 Cum ergo audissent clamorem famuli domus in pomario,
irruerunt per posticum ut viderent quidnam esset.

13:27 Postquam autem senes locuti sunt, erubuerunt servi vehementer:
quia numquam dictus fuerat sermo huiuscemodi de Susanna.  Et facta
est dies crastina.

13:28 Cumque venisset populus ad Ioakim virum eius, venerunt et duo
presbyteri pleni iniqua cogitatione adversus Susannam ut interficerent eam.

13:29 Et dixerunt coram populo: Mittite ad Susannam filiam Helciae
uxorem Ioakim.  Et statim miserunt.

13:30 Et venit cum parentibus, et filiis, et universis cognatis suis.

13:31 Porro Susanna erat delicata nimis, et pulchra specie.

13:32 At iniqui illi iusserunt ut discooperiretur (erat enim cooperta)
ut vel sic satiarentur decore eius.

13:33 Flebant igitur sui, et omnes qui noverant eam.

13:34 Consurgentes autem duo presbyteri in medio populi,
posuerunt manus suas super caput eius.

13:35 Quae flens suspexit ad caelum: erat enim cor eius fiduciam
habens in Domino.

13:36 Et dixerunt presbyteri: Cum deambularemus in pomario soli,
ingressa est haec cum duabus puellis: et clausit ostia pomarii,
et dimisit a se puellas.

13:37 Venitque ad eam adolescens, qui erat absconditus, et concubuit cum ea.

13:38 Porro nos cum essemus in angulo pomarii, videntes iniquitatem,
cucurrimus ad eos, et vidimus eos pariter commisceri.

13:39 Et illum quidem non quivimus comprehendere, quia fortior
nobis erat, et apertis ostiis exilivit:

13:40 hanc autem cum apprehendissemus, interrogavimus, quisnam
esset adolescens, et noluit indicare nobis: huius rei testes sumus.

13:41 Credidit eis multitudo quasi senibus et iudicibus populi,
et condemnaverunt eam ad mortem.

13:42 Exclamavit autem voce magna Susanna, et dixit: Deus aeterne,
qui absconditorum es cognitor, qui nosti omnia antequam fiant,

13:43 tu scis quoniam falsum testimonium tulerunt contra me:
et ecce morior, cum nihil horum fecerim, quae isti malitiose
composuerunt adversum me.

13:44 Exaudivit autem Dominus vocem eius.

13:45 Cumque duceretur ad mortem, suscitavit Dominus spiritum
sanctum pueri iunioris, cuius nomen Daniel:

13:46 Et exclamavit voce magna: Mundus ego sum a sanguine huius.

13:47 Et conversus omnis populus ad eum, dixit: Quis est iste sermo,
quem tu locutus es?

13:48 Qui cum staret in medio eorum, ait: Sic fatui filii Israel,
non iudicantes, neque quod verum est cognoscentes, condemnastis
filiam Israel?

13:49 Revertimini ad iudicium, quia falsum testimonium locuti sunt
adversus eam.

13:50 Reversus est ergo populus cum festinatione, et dixerunt ei senes:
Veni, et sede in medio nostrum, et indica nobis: quia tibi Deus dedit
honorem senectutis.

13:51 Et dixit ad eos Daniel: Separate illos ab invicem procul,
et diiudicabo eos.

13:52 Cum ergo divisi essent alter ab altero, vocavit unum de eis,
et dixit ad eum: Inveterate dierum malorum, nunc venerunt peccata tua,
quae operabaris prius:

13:53 iudicans iudicia iniusta, innocentes opprimens, et dimittens noxios,
dicente Domino: (x) Innocentem et iustum non interficies.

13:54 Nunc ergo si vidisti eam, dic sub qua arbore videris eos
colloquentes sibi.  Qui ait: Sub schino.

13:55 Dixit autem Daniel: Recte mentitus es in caput tuum:
Ecce enim Angelus Dei accepta sententia ab eo, scindet te medium.

13:56 Et, amoto eo, iussit venire alium, et dixit ei: Semen Chanaan,
et non Iuda, species decepit te, et concupiscentia subvertit cor tuum:

13:57 sic faciebatis filiabus Israel, et illae timentes loquebantur vobis:
sed filia Iuda non sustinuit iniquitatem vestram.

13:58 Nunc ergo dic mihi, sub qua arbore comprehenderis eos
loquentes sibi.  Qui ait: Sub prino.

13:59 Dixit autem ei Daniel: Recte mentitus es et tu in caput tuum:
manet enim Angelus Domini, gladium habens, ut secet te medium,
et interficiat vos.

13:60 Exclamavit itaque omnis coetus voce magna, et benedixerunt Deum,
qui salvat sperantes in se.

13:61 Et consurrexerunt adversus duos presbyteros (convicerat enim
eos Daniel ex ore suo falsum dixisse testimonium) feceruntque eis
sicut male egerant adversus proximum,

13:62 (y) ut facerent secundum legem Moysi: et interfecerunt eos,
et salvatus est sanguis innoxius in die illa.

13:63 Helcias autem et uxor eius laudaverunt Deum pro filia sua
Susanna cum Ioakim marito eius, et cognatis omnibus, quia non esset
inventa in ea res turpis.

13:64 Daniel autem factus est magnus in conspectu populi a die illa,
et deinceps.



2. AD 6:28, DE EVERSIONE IDOLORUM, 13:65-14:42.


13:65 Et rex Astyages appositus est ad patres suos, et suscepit
Cyrus Perses regnum eius.

14:1 Erat autem Daniel conviva regis, et honoratus super omnes amicos eius.

14:2 Erat quoque idolum apud Babylonios nomine Bel: et impendebantur
in eo per dies singulos similae artabae duodecim, et oves quadraginta,
vinique amphorae sex.

14:3 Rex quoque colebat eum, et ibat per singulos dies adorare eum:
porro Daniel adorabat Deum suum.  Dixitque ei rex: Quare non adoras Bel?

14:4 Qui respondens, ait ei: Quia non colo idola manufacta,
sed viventem Deum, qui creavit caelum, et terram, et habet
potestatem omnis carnis.

14:5 Et dixit rex ad eum: Non videtur tibi esse Bel vivens Deus?
An non vides quanta comedat, et bibat quotidie?

14:6 Et ait Daniel arridens: Ne erres rex. iste enim intrinsecus
luteus est, et forinsecus aereus, neque comedit aliquando.

14:7 Et iratus rex vocavit sacerdotes eius, et ait eis:
Nisi dixeritis mihi, quis est qui comedat impensas has, moriemini.

14:8 Si autem ostenderitis, quoniam Bel comedat haec, morietur Daniel,
quia blasphemavit in Bel.  Et dixit Daniel regi: Fiat iuxta verbum tuum.

14:9 Erant autem sacerdotes Bel septuaginta, exceptis uxoribus,
et parvulis, et filiis.  Et venit rex cum Daniele in templum Bel.

14:10 Et dixerunt sacerdotes Bel: Ecce nos egredimur foras: et tu rex
pone escas, et vinum misce, et claude ostium, et signa annulo tuo:

14:11 et cum ingressus fueris mane, nisi inveneris omnia comesta a Bel,
morte moriemur, vel Daniel qui mentitus est adversum nos.

14:12 Contemnebant autem, quia fecerant sub mensa absconditum introitum,
et per illum ingrediebantur semper, et devorabant ea.

14:13 Factum est igitur postquam egressi sunt illi, rex posuit cibos
ante Bel: praecepit Daniel pueris suis, et attulerunt cinerem,
et cribravit per totum templum coram rege: et egressi clauserunt ostium:
et signantes annulo regis abierunt.

14:14 Sacerdotes autem ingressi sunt nocte iuxta consuetudinem suam,
et uxores et filii eorum: et comederunt omnia, et biberunt.

14:15 Surrexit autem rex primo diluculo, et Daniel cum eo.

14:16 Et ait rex: Salvane sunt signacula, Daniel?  Qui respondit:
Salva, rex.

14:17 Statimque cum aperuisset ostium, intuitus rex mensam,
exclamavit voce magna: Magnus es Bel, et non est apud te dolus quisquam.

14:18 Et risit Daniel: et tenuit regem ne ingrederetur intro:
et dixit: Ecce pavimentum, animadverte cuius vestigia sint haec.

14:19 Et dixit rex: Video vestigia virorum, et mulierum, et infantium.
Et iratus est rex.

14:20 Tunc apprehendit sacerdotes, et uxores, et filios eorum:
et ostenderunt ei abscondita ostiola, per quae ingrediebantur,
et consumebant quae erant super mensam.

14:21 Occidit ergo illos rex, et tradidit Bel in potestatem Danielis:
qui subvertit eum, et templum eius.

14:22 Et erat draco magnus in loco illo, et colebant eum Babylonii.

14:23 Et dixit rex Danieli: Ecce nunc non potes dicere quia iste
non sit Deus vivens: adora ergo eum.

14:24 Dixitque Daniel: Dominum Deum meum adoro: quia ipse est
Deus vivens: iste autem non est Deus vivens.

14:25 Tu autem rex da mihi potestatem, et interficiam draconem
absque gladio, et fuste.  Et ait rex: Do tibi.

14:26 Tulit ergo Daniel picem, et adipem, et pilos, et coxit pariter:
fecitque massas, et dedit in os draconis, et diruptus est draco.
Et dixit: Ecce quem colebatis.

14:27 Quod cum audissent Babylonii, indignati sunt vehementer:
et congregati adversum regem, dixerunt: Iudaeus factus est rex:
Bel destruxit, draconem interfecit, et sacerdotes occidit.

14:28 Et dixerunt cum venissent ad regem: Trade nobis Danielem,
alioquin interficiemus te, et domum tuam.

14:29 Vidit ergo rex quod irruerent in eum vehementer:
et necessitate compulsus tradidit eis Danielem.

14:30 Qui miserunt eum in lacum leonum, et erat ibi diebus sex.

14:31 Porro in lacu erant leones septem, et dabantur eis duo
corpora quotidie, et duae oves: et tunc non data sunt eis,
ut devorarent Danielem.

14:32 Erat autem Habacuc propheta in Iudaea, et ipse coxerat pulmentum,
et intriverat panes in alveolo: et ibat in campum ut ferret messoribus.

14:33 Dixitque Angelus Domini ad Habacuc: Fer prandium, quod habes,
in Babylonem Danieli, qui est in lacu leonum.

14:34 Et dixit Habacuc: Domine, Babylonem non vidi, et lacum nescio.

14:35 (z) Et apprehendit eum Angelus Domini in vertice eius,
et portavit eum capillo capitis sui, posuitque eum in Babylone
supra lacum in impetu spiritus sui.

14:36 Et clamavit Habacuc, dicens: Daniel serve Dei, tolle prandium,
quod misit tibi Deus.

14:37 Et ait Daniel: Recordatus es mei Deus, et non dereliquisti
diligentes te.

14:38 Surgensque Daniel comedit.  Porro Angelus Domini restituit
Habacuc confestim in loco suo.

14:39 Venit ergo rex die septimo ut lugeret Danielem: et venit ad lacum,
et introspexit, et ecce Daniel sedens in medio leonum.

14:40 Et exclamavit voce magna rex, dicens: Magnus es Domine Deus Danielis.
Et extraxit eum de lacu leonum.

14:41 Porro illos, qui perditionis eius causa fuerant, intromisit
in lacum, et devorati sunt in momento coram eo.

14:42 Tunc rex ait: Paveant omnes habitantes in universa terra
Deum Danielis: quia ipse est Salvator, faciens signa, et mirabilia
in terra: qui liberavit Danielem de lacu leonum.

2:2 Praecepit autem; Heb. et Gr. et praecepit.

2:22 Deus patrum nostrorum; in Heb. (Aram.) Deus patris mei,
in Gr. patrum meorum, quae lection in priore Congr. fuit probata,
in posteriore vero mutata in "patrum nostrorum" (Aram. 'abhahathi
est pluralis, ergo "patrum meorum" est lectio vera).

2:34 lapis de monte; "de monte" non legunt Heb. (Aram.),
tamen habent Gr., Congr. retinuit.

3:52 et gloriosus; Gr. et quaedam Ms. non legunt, habet tamen
textus Hieronymi.

3:94 sarabala eorum; ubi supra (versu 21) dicitur "cum braccis suis",
habetur hoc idem vocabulum.  Nescio cur Vulgatus hoc in loco reservavit
nomen "sarabala", illic autem vertit (Aram. sarabala, Gr. sarabara erat
vestis Persica, braccae vel pallium).

4:20 super eum; Gr. et in quibusdam Ms. legitur "super eam" (Gr. super eum).

I have transcribed from this source as accurately as possible for
this e-text, with the following changes:
1) I formatted each verse into a separate line and added the chapter
number to each verse number.  In doing this I lost the source's
paragraph structure.
2) I exploded the ligatures for "ae" and "oe" into two characters
rather than one character for each diphthong.
3) Using the New American Bible as I guide I rearranged the verses
to approximate the Greek Septuagint form of Esther.  No verses were
added or removed.  I added a common alphabetical chaper designation
format for the Septuagint sections; the original chapter:verse numbers
are in brackets next to the letter designation.
4) I capitalized all of the section headings which were either in
bold or italicized print originally.  These sections headings may
not be original to the Vulgate, but then neither are verse numbers.
I modified these headers slightly in keeping with the reformatting.
5) I removed the footnotes, marginal notes, and appendix.
6) I added a note in English about the arrangement to the end of
the body of the text.

Please note that some sentence-like sections end with a period, but
the following line does not begin with a capital letter.  I recommend
that this format remain.  The source's editor seems to have been
quite confident in the propriety of this approach.  I have retained
all of the source's capitalization and punctuation except for the
section headers.

65 is the target line length, but the margination is ragged at places.

SOMNIUM MARDOCHAEI NARRATUR.


A:1 [11:2] Anno secundo, regnante Artaxerxe maximo, prima die mensis
Nisan, vidit somnium Mardochaeus filius Iairi, filii Semei, filii Cis,
de tribu Beniamin:

A:2 [11:3] homo Iudaeus, qui habitabat in urbe Susis, vir magnus, et
inter primos aulae regiae.

A:3 [11:4] Erat autem de eo numero captivorum, quos transtulerat
Nabuchodonosor rex Babylonis de Ierusalem cum Ieconia rege Iuda:

A:4 [11:5] et hoc eius somnium fuit: Apparuerunt voces, et tumultus,
et tonitrua, et terraemotus, et conturbatio super terram:

A:5 [11:6] et ecce duo dracones magni, paratique contra se in
praelium.

A:6 [11:7] Ad quorum clamorem cunctae concitatae sunt nationes, ut
pugnarent contra gentem iustorum.

A:7 [11:8] Fuitque dies illa tenebrarum et discriminis, tribulationis
et angustiae, et ingens formido super terram.

A:8 [11:9] Conturbataque est gens iustorum timentium mala sua, et
praeparata ad mortem.

A:9 [11:10] Clamaveruntque ad Deum: et illis vociferantibus, fons
parvus crevit in fluvium maximum, et in aquas plurimas redundavit.

A:10 [11:11] Lux et sol ortus est, et humiles exaltati sunt, et
devoraverunt inclytos.

A:11 [11:12] Quod cum vidisset Mardochaeus, et surrexisset de strato,
cogitabat quid Deus facere vellet: et fixum habebat in animo, scire
cupiens quid significaret somnium.



MARDOCHAEUS CONIURATIONEM IANITORUM PATEFACIT.


A:12 [12:1] Morabatur autem eo tempore in aula regis cum Bagatha et
Thara eunuchis regis, qui ianitores erant palatii.

A:13 [12:2] Cumque intellexisset cogitationes eorum, et curas
diligentius pervidisset, didicit quod conarentur in regem Artaxerxem
manus mittere, et nunciavit super eo regi.

A:14 [12:3] Qui de utroque, habita quaestione, confessos iussit duci
ad mortem.

A:15 [12:4] Rex autem quod gestum erat, scripsit in commentariis: sed
et Mardochaeus rei memoriam litteris tradidit.

A:16 [12:5] Praecepitque ei rex, ut in aula palatii moraretur, datis
ei pro delatione muneribus.

A:17 [12:6a] Aman vero filius Amadathi bugaeus erat gloriosissimus
coram rege, et voluit nocere Mardochaeo, et populo eius pro duobus
eunuchis regis, qui fuerant interfecti.



REGINA VASTHI EICITUR.


1:1 In diebus Assueri, qui regnavit ab India usque Aethiopiam super
centum viginti septem provincias:

1:2 quando sedit in solio regni sui, Susan civitas regni eius exordium
fuit.

1:3 Tertio igitur anno imperii sui fecit grande convivium cunctis
principibus, et pueris suis, fortissimis Persarum, et Medorum
inclytis, et praefectis provinciarum coram se,

1:4 ut ostenderet divitias gloriae regni sui, ac magnitudinem, atque
iactantiam potentiae suae, multo tempore, centum videlicet et
octoginta diebus.

1:5 Cumque implerentur dies convivii, invitavit omnem populum, qui
inventus est in Susan, a maximo usque ad minimum: et iussit septem
diebus convivium praeparari in vestibulo horti, et nemoris, quod regio
cultu et manu consitum erat.

1:6 Et pendebant ex omni parte tentoria aerii coloris et carbasini ac
hyacinthini, sustentata funibus byssinis, atque purpureis, qui
eburneis circulis inserti erant, et columnis marmoreis fulciebantur.
Lectuli quoque aurei et argentei, super pavimentum smaragdino et pario
stratum lapide, dispositi erant: quod mira varietate pictura
decorabat.

1:7 Bibebant autem qui invitati erant, aureis poculis, et aliis atque
aliis vasis cibi inferebantur. Vinum quoque, ut magnificentia regia
dignum erat, abundans, et praecipuum ponebatur.

1:8 Nec erat qui nolentes cogeret ad bibendum, sed sicut rex
statuerat, praeponens mensis singulos de principibus suis ut sumeret
unusquisque quod vellet.

1:9 Vasthi quoque regina fecit convivium feminarum in palatio, ubi rex
Assuerus manere consueverat.

1:10 Itaque die septimo, cum rex esset hilarior, et post nimiam
potationem incaluisset mero, praecepit Maumam, et Bazatha, et Harbona,
et Bagatha et Abgatha, et Zethar, et Charchas, septem eunuchis, qui in
conspectu eius ministrabant,

1:11 ut introducerent reginam Vasthi coram rege, posito super caput
eius diademate, ut ostenderet cunctis populis et principibus
pulchritudinem illius: erat enim pulchra valde.

1:12 Quae renuit, et ad regis imperium, quod per eunuchos mandaverat,
venire contempsit. Unde iratus rex, et nimio furore succensus,

1:13 interrogavit sapientes, qui ex more regio semper ei aderant, et
illorum faciebat cuncta consilio, scientium leges, ac iura maiorum:

(1:14 erant autem primi et proximi, Charsena, et Sethar, et Admatha,
et Tharsis, et Mares, et Marsana, et Mamuchan, septem duces Persarum,
atque Medorum, qui videbant faciem regis, et primi post eum residere
soliti erant)

1:15 cui sententiae Vasthi regina subiaceret, quae Assueri regis
imperium, quod per eunuchos mandaverat, facere noluisset.

1:16 Responditque Mamuchan, audiente rege, atque principibus, Non
solum regem laesit regina Vasthi, sed et omnes populos, et principes,
qui sunt in cunctis provinciis regis Assueri.

1:17 Egredietur enim sermo reginae ad omnes mulieres, ut contemnant
viros suos, et dicant: Rex Assuerus iussit ut regina Vasthi intraret
ad eum, et illa noluit.

1:18 Atque hoc exemplo omnes principum coniuges Persarum atque
Medorum, parvipendent imperia maritorum: unde regis iusta est
indignatio.

1:19 Si tibi placet, egrediatur edictum a facie tua, et scribatur
iuxta legem Persarum atque Medorum, quam praeteriri illicitum est, ut
nequaquam ultra Vasthi ingrediatur ad regem, sed regnum illius,
altera, quae melior est illa, accipiat.

1:20 Et hoc in omne (quod latissimum est) provinciarum tuarum
divulgetur imperium, et cunctae uxores tam maiorum, quam minorum
deferant maritis suis honorem.

1:21 placuit consilium eius regi, et principibus: fecitque rex iuxta
consilium Mamuchan,

1:22 et misit epistolas ad universas provincias regni sui, ut quaeque
gens audire et legere poterat, diversis linguis et litteris, esse
viros principes ac maiores in domibus suis: et hoc per cunctos populos
divulgari.



ESTHER ELIGITUR REGINA.


2:1 His ita gestis, postquam regis Assueri indignatio deferbuerat,
recordatus est Vasthi, et quae fecisset, vel quae passa esset:

2:2 dixeruntque pueri regis, ac ministri eius: Quaerantur regi puellae
virgines ac speciosae,

2:3 et mittantur qui considerent per universas provincias puellas
speciosas et virgines: et adducant eas ad civitatem Susan, et tradant
eas in domum feminarum sub manu Egei eunuchi, qui est praepositus et
custos mulierum regiarum: et accipiant mundum muliebrem, et cetera ad
usus necessaria.

2:4 Et quaecumque inter omnes oculis regis placuerit, ipsa regnet pro
Vasthi. Placuit sermo regi: et ita, ut suggesserant, iussit fieri.

2:5 Erat vir Iudaeus in Susan civitate, vocabulo Mardochaeus filius
Iair, filii Semei, filii Cis, de stirpe Iemini,

2:6 qui translatus fuerat de Ierusalem eo tempore, quo Iechoniam regem
Iuda Nabuchodonosor rex Babylonis transtulerat,

2:7 qui fuit nutritius filiae fratris sui Edissae, quae altero nomine
vocabatur Esther: et utrumque parentem amiserat: pulchra nimis, et
decora facie. Mortuisque patre eius ac matre, Mardochaeus sibi eam
adoptavit in filiam.

2:8 Cumque percrebruisset regis imperium, et iuxta mandatum illius
multae pulchrae virgines adducerentur Susan, et Egeo traderentur
Eunucho; Esther quoque inter ceteras puellas ei tradita est, ut
servaretur in numero feminarum.

2:9 Quae placuit ei, et invenit gratiam in conspectu illius. Et
praecepit eunucho, ut acceleraret mundum muliebrem, et traderet ei
partes suas, et septem puellas speciosissimas de domo regis, et tam
ipsam, quam pedissequas eius ornaret atque excoleret.

2:10 Quae noluit indicare ei populum et patriam suam: Mardochaeus enim
praeceperat ei, ut de hac re omnino reticeret:

2:11 qui deambulabat quotidie ante vestibulum domus, in qua electae
virgines servabantur, curam agens salutis Esther, et scire volens quid
ei accideret.

2:12 Cum autem venisset tempus singularum per ordinem puellarum, ut
intrarent ad regem, expletis omnibus, quae ad cultum muliebrem
pertinebant, mensis duodecimus vertebatur: ita dumtaxat, ut sex
mensibus oleo ungerentur myrrhino, et aliis sex quibusdam pigmentis et
aromatibus uterentur.

2:13 Ingredientesque ad regem, quidquid postulassent ad ornatum
pertinens, accipiebant: et ut eis placuerat, compositae de triclinio
feminarum ad regis cubiculum transibant.

2:14 Et quae intraverat vespere, egrediebatur mane, atque inde in
secundas aedes deducebatur, quae sub manu Susagazi eunuchi erant, qui
concubinis regis praesidebat: nec habebat potestatem ad regem ultra
redeundi, nisi voluisset rex, et eam venire iussisset ex nomine.

2:15 Evoluto autem tempore per ordinem, instabat dies, quo Esther
filia Abihail fratris Mardochaei, quam sibi adoptaverat in filiam,
deberet intrare ad regem. Quae non quaesivit muliebrem cultum, sed
quaecumque voluit Egeus eunuchus custos virginum, haec ei ad ornatum
dedit. Erat enim formosa valde, et incredibili pulchritudine, omnium
oculis gratiosa et amabilis videbatur.

2:16 Ducta est itaque ad cubiculum regis Assueri mense decimo, qui
vocatur Tebeth, septimo anno regni eius.

2:17 Et adamavit eam rex plus quam omnes mulieres, habuitque gratiam
et misericordiam coram eo super omnes mulieres, et posuit diadema
regni in capite eius, fecitque eam regnare in loco Vasthi.

2:18 Et iussit convivium praeparari permagnificum cunctis principibus,
et servis suis pro coniunctione, et nuptiis Esther.  Et dedit requiem
universis provinciis, ac dona largitus est iuxta magnificentiam
principalem.



MARDOCHAEUS CONIURATIONEM IANITORUM PATEFACIT.


2:19 Cumque secundo quaererentur virgines et congregarentur,
Mardochaeus manebat ad ianuam regis:

2:20 necdum prodiderat Esther patriam, et populum suum, iuxta mandatum
eius. Quidquid enim ille praecipiebat, observabat Esther: et ita
cuncta faciebat ut eo tempore solita erat, quo eam parvulam nutriebat.

2:21 Eo igitur tempore, quo Mardochaeus ad regis ianuam morabatur,
irati sunt Bagathan, et Thares duo eunuchi regis, qui ianitores erant,
et in primo palatii limine praesidebant: volueruntque insurgere in
regem, et occidere eum.

2:22 Quod Mardochaeum non latuit, statimque nunciavit reginae Esther:
et illa regi ex nomine Mardochaei, qui ad se rem detulerat.

2:23 Quaesitum est, et inventum: et appensus est uterque eorum in
patibulo. Mandatumque est historiis, et annalibus traditum coram rege.



AMAN POPULUM IUDAEORUM PERDERE VULT.


3:1 Post haec rex Assuerus exaltavit Aman filium Amadathi, qui erat de
stirpe Agag: et posuit solium eius super omnes principes, quos
habebat.

3:2 Cunctique servi regis, qui in foribus palatii versabantur,
flectebant genua, et adorabant Aman: sic enim praeceperat eis
imperator. solus Mardochaeus non flectebat genu, neque adorabat eum.

3:3 Cui dixerunt pueri regis, qui ad fores palatii praesidebant: Cur
praeter ceteros non observas mandatum regis?

3:4 Cumque hoc crebrius dicerent, et ille nollet audire, nunciaverunt
Aman, scire cupientes utrum perseveraret in sententia: dixerat enim
eis se esse Iudaeum.

3:5 Quod cum audisset Aman, et experimento probasset quod Mardochaeus
non flecteret sibi genu, nec se adoraret, iratus est valde,

3:6 et pro nihilo duxit in unum Mardochaeum mittere manus suas:
audierat enim quod esset gentis Iudaeae. magisque voluit omnem
Iudaeorum, qui erant in regno Assueri, perdere nationem.

3:7 Mense primo (cuius vocabulum est Nisan) anno duodecimo regni
Assueri, missa est sors in urnam, quae Hebraice dicitur phur, coram
Aman, quo die et quo mense gens Iudaeorum deberet interfici: et exivit
mensis duodecimus, qui vocatur Adar.

3:8 Dixitque Aman regi Assuero: Est populus per omnes provincias regni
tui dispersus, et a se mutuo separatus, novis utens legibus et
ceremoniis, insuper et regis scita contemnens. Et optime nosti quod
non expediat regno tuo ut insolescat per licentiam.

3:9 si tibi placet, decerne, ut pereat, et decem millia talentorum
appendam arcariis gazae tuae.

3:10 Tulit ergo rex annulum, quo utebatur, de manu sua, et dedit eum
Aman filio Amadathi de progenie Agag, hosti Iudaeorum,

3:11 dixitque ad eum: Argentum, quod tu polliceris, tuum sit. de
populo age quod tibi placet.

3:12 Vocatique sunt scribae regis mense primo Nisan, tertiadecima die
eiusdem mensis: et scriptum est, ut iusserat Aman, ad omnes satrapas
regis, et iudices provinciarum, diversarumque gentium, ut quaeque gens
legere poterat, et audire pro varietate linguarum ex nomine regis
Assueri: et litterae signatae ipsius annulo,

3:13 missae sunt per cursores regis ad universas provincias ut
occiderent atque delerent omnes Iudaeos, a puero usque ad senem,
parvulos, et mulieres, uno die, hoc est tertiodecimo mensis duodecimi,
qui vocatur Adar, et bona eorum diriperent.



PRIOR EPISTOLA XERXIS.


B:1a [12:6b] Epistolae autem hoc exemplar fuit.

B:1b [13:1] Rex maximus Artaxerxes ab India usque Aethiopiam centum
vigintiseptem provinciarum principibus, et ducibus, qui eius imperio
subiecti sunt, salutem.

B:2 [13:2] Cum plurimis gentibus imperarem, et universum orbem meae
ditioni subiugassem, volui nequaquam abuti potentiae magnitudine, sed
clementia et lenitate gubernare subiectos, ut absque ullo terrore
vitam silentio transigentes, optata cunctis mortalibus pace
fruerentur.

B:3 [13:3] Quaerente autem me a consiliariis meis quomodo posset hoc
impleri, unus qui sapientia et fide ceteros praecellebat, et erat post
regem secundus, Aman nomine,

B:4 [13:4] indicavit mihi in toto orbe terrarum populum esse
dispersum, qui novis uteretur legibus, et contra omnium Gentium
consuetudinem faciens, Regum iussa contemneret, et universarum
concordiam nationum sua dissensione violaret.

B:5 [13:5] Quod cum didicissemus, videntes unam gentem rebellem
adversus omne hominum genus perversis uti legibus, nostrisque
iussionibus contraire, et turbare subiectarum nobis provinciarum pacem
atque concordiam,

B:6 [13:6] iussimus ut quoscumque Aman, qui omnibus provinciis
praepositus est, et secundus a rege, et quem patris loco colimus,
monstraverit, cum coniugibus ac liberis deleantur ab inimicis suis,
nullusque eorum misereatur, quartadecima die duodecimi mensis Adar
anni praesentis:

B:7 [13:7] ut nefarii homines uno die ad inferos descendentes, reddant
imperio nostro pacem, quam turbaverant.

3:14 Summa autem epistolarum haec fuit, ut omnes provinciae scirent,
et pararent se ad praedictam diem.

3:15 Festinabant cursores, qui missi erant, regis imperium explere.
Statimque in Susan pependit edictum, rege et Aman celebrante
convivium, et cunctis Iudaeis, qui in urbe erant, flentibus.



MARDOCHAEUS REGINAM INVOCAT.


4:1 Quae cum audisset Mardochaeus, scidit vestimenta sua, et indutus
est sacco, spargens cinerem capiti: et in platea mediae civitatis voce
magna clamabat, ostendens amaritudinem animi sui,

4:2 et hoc eiulatu usque ad fores palatii gradiens. Non enim erat
licitum indutum sacco aulam regis intrare.

4:3 In omnibus quoque provinciis, oppidis, ac locis, ad quae crudele
regis dogma pervenerat, planctus ingens erat apud Iudaeos, ieiunium,
ululatus, et fletus, sacco et cinere multis pro strato utentibus.

4:4 Ingressae autem sunt puellae Esther et eunuchi, nunciaveruntque
ei. Quod audiens consternata est: et vestem misit, ut ablato sacco
induerent eum: quam accipere noluit.

4:5 Accitoque Athach eunucho, quem rex ministrum ei dederat, praecepit
ei ut iret ad Mardochaeum, et disceret ab eo cur hoc faceret.

4:6 Egressusque Athach, ivit ad Mardochaeum stantem in platea
civitatis, ante ostium palatii:

4:7 qui indicavit ei omnia, quae acciderant, quo modo Aman
promisisset, ut in thesauros regis pro Iudaeorum nece inferret
argentum.

4:8 exemplar quoque edicti, quod pendebat in Susan, dedit ei, ut
reginae ostenderet, et moneret eam, ut intraret ad regem, et
deprecaretur eum pro populo suo.

[B:7.5 [15:1] Et mandavit ei (haud dubium quin esset Mardochaeus) ut
ingrederetur ad regem, et rogaret pro populo suo et pro patria sua.]

B:8 [15:2] Memorare (inquit) dierum humilitatis tuae, quomodo nutrita
sis in manu mea, quia Aman secundus a rege locutus est contra nos in
mortem:

4:9a [15:3] et tu invoca Dominum, et loquere regi pro nobis, et libera
nos de morte.

4:9b [4:9] Regressus Athach, nunciavit Esther omnia, quae Mardochaeus
dixerat.

4:10 Quae repondit ei, et iussit ut diceret Mardochaeo:

4:11 Omnes servi regis, et cunctae, quae sub ditione eius sunt, norunt
provinciae, quod sive vir, sive mulier non vocatus, interius atrium
regis intraverit, absque ulla cunctatione statim interficiatur: nisi
forte rex auream virgam ad eum tetenderit pro signo clementiae, atque
ita possit vivere. Ego igitur quo modo ad regem intrare potero, quae
triginta iam diebus non sum vocata ad eum?

4:12 Quod cum audisset Mardochaeus,

4:13 rursum mandavit Esther, dicens: Ne putes quod animam tuam tantum
liberes, quia in domo regis es prae cunctis Iudaeis:

4:14 si enim nunc silueris, per aliam occasionem liberabuntur Iudaei:
et tu, et domus patris tui peribitis. Et quis novit utrum idcirco ad
regnum veneris, ut in tali tempore parareris?

4:15 Rursumque Esther haec Mardochaeo verba mandavit:

4:16 Vade et congrega omnes Iudaeos, quos in Susan repereris, et orate
pro me. Non comedatis, et non bibatis tribus diebus, et tribus
noctibus: et ego cum ancillis meis similiter ieiunabo, et tunc
ingrediar ad regem contra legem faciens, non vocata, tradensque me
morti et periculo.



DEPRECATIO MARDOCHAEI.


C:0 [4:17] Ivit itaque Mardochaeus, et fecit omnia, quae ei Esther
praeceperat.

C:1 [13:8] Mardochaeus autem deprecatus est Dominum, memor omnium
operum eius,

C:2 [13:9] et dixit: Domine Domine rex omnipotens, in ditione enim tua
cuncta sunt posita, et non est qui possit tuae resistere voluntati, si
decreveris salvare Israel.

C:3 [13:10] Tu fecisti caelum et terram, et quidquid caeli ambitu
continetur.

C:4 [13:11] Dominus omnium es, nec est qui resistat maiestati tuae.

C:5 [13:12] Cuncta nosti, et scis quia non pro superbia et contumelia,
et aliqua gloriae cupiditate fecerim hoc, ut non adorarem Aman
superbissimum,

C:6 [13:13] (Libenter enim pro salute Israel etiam vestigia pedum eius
deosculari paratus essem,)

C:7 [13:14] sed timui ne honorem Dei mei transferrem ad hominem, et ne
quemquam adorarem, excepto Deo meo.

C:8 [13:15] Et nunc Domine rex Deus Abraham miserere populi tui, quia
volunt nos inimici nostri perdere, et hereditatem tuam delere.

C:9 [13:16] Ne despicias partem tuam, quam redemisti tibi de Aegypto.

C:10 [13:17] Exaudi deprecationem meam, et propitius esto sorti et
funiculo tuo, et converte luctum nostrum in gaudium, ut viventes
laudemus nomen tuum Domine, et ne claudas ora te canentium.

C:11 [13:18] Omnis quoque Israel pari mente et obsecratione clamavit
ad Dominum, eo quod eis certa mors impenderet.



OBSECRATIO REGINAE ESTHER.


C:12 [14:1] Esther quoque regina confugit ad Dominum, pavens
periculum, quod imminebat.

C:13 [14:2] Cumque deposuisset vestes regias, fletibus et luctui apta
indumenta suscepit, et pro unguentis variis, cinere et stercore
implevit caput, et corpus suum humiliavit ieiuniis: omniaque loca, in
quibus antea laetari consueverat, crinium laceratione complevit.

C:14 [14:3] Et deprecabatur Dominum Deum Israel, dicens: Domine mi,
qui rex noster es solus, adiuva me solitariam, et cuius praeter te
nullus est auxiliator alius.

C:15 [14:4] Periculum meum in manibus meis est.

C:16 [14:5] Audivi a patre meo quod tu Domine tulisses Israel de
cunctis Gentibus, et patres nostros ex omnibus retro maioribus suis,
ut possideres hereditatem sempiternam, fecistique eis sicut locutus
es.

C:17 [14:6] Peccavimus in conspectu tuo, et idcirco tradidisti nos in
manus inimicorum nostrorum:

C:18 [14:7] coluimus enim deos eorum. Iustus es Domine:

C:19 [14:8] et nunc non eis sufficit, quod durissima nos opprimunt
servitute, sed robur manuum suarum, idolorum potentiae deputantes,

C:20 [14:9] volunt tua mutare promissa, et delere hereditatem tuam, et
claudere ora laudantium te, atque extinguere gloriam templi et altaris
tui,

C:21 [14:10] ut aperiant ora Gentium, et laudent idolorum
fortitudinem, et praedicent carnalem regem in sempiternum.

C:22 [14:11] Ne tradas Domine sceptrum tuum his, qui non sunt, ne
rideant ad ruinam nostram: sed converte consilium eorum super eos, et
eum, qui in nos coepit saevire, disperde.

C:23 [14:12] Memento Domine, et ostende te nobis in tempore
tribulationis nostrae, et da mihi fiduciam Domine rex deorum, et
universae potestatis:

C:24 [14:13] tribue sermonem compositum in ore meo in conspectu
leonis, et transfer cor illius in odium hostis nostri, ut et ipse
pereat, et ceteri, qui ei consentiunt.

C:25 [14:14] Nos autem libera manu tua, et adiuva me, nullum aliud
auxilium habentem, nisi te, Domine, qui habes omnium scientiam,

C:26 [14:15] et nosti quia oderim gloriam iniquorum, et detester
cubile incircumcisorum, et onmis alienigenae.

C:27 [14:16] Tu scis necessitatem meam, quod abominer signum superbiae
et gloriae meae, quod est super caput meum in diebus ostentationis
meae, et detester illud quasi pannum menstruatae, et non portem in
diebus silentii mei,

C:28 [14:17] et quod non comederim in mensa Aman, nec mihi placuerit
convivium regis, et non biberim vinum libaminum:

C:29 [14:18] et numquam laetata sit ancilla tua, ex quo huc translata
sum usque in praesentem diem, nisi in te Domine Deus Abraham.

C:30 [14:19] Deus fortis super omnes, exaudi vocem eorum, qui nullam
aliam spem habent, et libera nos de manu iniquorum, et erue me a
timore meo.



ESTHER AD REGEM INGREDITUR.


D:1 [15:4] Die autem tertio deposuit vestimenta ornatus sui, et
circumdata est gloria sua.

D:2 [15:5] Cumque regio fulgeret habitu, et invocasset omnium rectorem
et salvatorem Deum, assumpsit duas famulas,

D:3 [15:6] et super unam quidem innitebatur, quasi prae deliciis et
nimia teneritudine corpus suum ferre non sustinens:

D:4 [15:7] altera autem famularum sequebatur dominam, defluentia in
humum indumenta sustentans.

D:5 [15:8] Ipsa autem roseo colore vultum perfusa, et gratis ac
nitentibus oculis tristem celabat animum, et nimio timore contractum.

D:6 [15:9] Ingressa igitur cuncta per ordinem ostia, stetit contra
regem, ubi ille residebat super solium regni sui, indutus vestibus
regiis, auroque fulgens, et pretiosis lapidibus, eratque terribilis
aspectu.

D:7 [15:10] Cumque elevasset faciem, et ardentibus oculis furorem
pectoris indicasset, regina corruit, et in pallorem colore mutato,
lassum super ancillulam reclinavit caput.

D:8 [15:11] Convertitque Deus spiritum regis in mansuetudinem, et
festinus ac metuens exilivit de solio, et sustentans eam ulnis suis,
donec rediret ad se, his verbis blandiebatur:

D:9 [15:12] Quid habes Esther? Ego sum frater tuus, noli metuere.

D:10 [15:13] Non morieris: non enim pro te, sed pro omnibus haec lex
constituta est.

D:11 [15:14] Accede igitur, et tange sceptrum.

D:12 [15:15] Cumque illa reticeret, tulit auream virgam, et posuit
super collum eius, et osculatus est eam, et ait: Cur mihi non
loqueris?

D:13 [15:16] Quae respondit: Vidi te domine quasi Angelum Dei, et
conturbatum est cor meum prae timore gloriae tuae.

D:14 [15:17] Valde enim mirabilis es domine, et facies tua plena est
gratiarum.

D:15 [15:18] Cumque loqueretur, rursus corruit, et pene exanimata est.

D:16 [15:19] Rex autem turbabatur, et omnes ministri eius
consolabantur eam.

[5:1 Die autem tertio induta est Esther regalibus vestimentis, et
stetit in atrio domus regiae, quod erat interius, contra basilicam
regis: at ille sedebat super solium suum in consistorio palatii contra
ostium domus.

5:2 Cumque vidisset Esther reginam stantem, placuit oculis eius, et
extendit contra eam virgam auream, quam tenebat manu: Quae accedens,
osculata est summitatem virgae eius:]

5:3 Dixitque ad eam rex: Quid vis Esther regina? quae est petitio tua?
etiam si dimidiam partem regni petieris, dabitur tibi.

5:4 At illa respondit: Si regi placet, obsecro ut venias ad me hodie,
et Aman tecum ad convivium, quod paravi.

5:5 Statimque Rex, Vocate, inquit, cito Aman ut Esther obediat
voluntati. Venerunt itaque rex et Aman ad convivium, quod eis regina
paraverat.

5:6 Dixitque ei rex, postquam vinum biberat abundanter: Quid petis ut
detur tibi? et pro qua re postulas? etiam si dimidiam partem regni mei
petieris, impetrabis.

5:7 Cui respondit Esther: Petitio mea, et preces sunt istae:

5:8 Si inveni in conspectu regis gratiam, et si regi placet ut det
mihi quod postulo, et meam impleat petitionem:  veniat rex et Aman ad
convivium quod paravi eis, et cras aperiam regi voluntatem meam.



AMAN PRO MARDOCHAEO PATIBULUM PARAT.


5:9 Egressus est itaque illo die Aman laetus et alacer. Cumque
vidisset Mardochaeum sedentem ante fores palatii, et non solum non
assurrexisse sibi, sed nec motum quidem de loco sessionis suae,
indignatus est valde:

5:10 et dissimulata ira, reversus in domum suam, convocavit ad se
amicos suos, et Zares uxorem suam:

5:11 et exposuit illis magnitudinem divitiarum suarum, filiorumque
turbam, et quanta eum gloria super omnes principes et servos suos rex
elevasset.

5:12 Et post haec ait: Regina quoque Esther nullum alium vocavit ad
convivium cum rege, praeter me: apud quam etiam cras cum rege
pransurus sum.

5:13 Et cum haec omnia habeam, nihil me habere puto, quamdiu videro
Mardochaeum Iudaeum sedentem ante fores regias.

5:14 Responderuntque ei Zales uxor eius, et ceteri amici: Iube parari
excelsam trabem, habentem altitudinis quinquaginta cubitos, et dic
mane regi ut appendatur super eam Mardochaeus, et sic ibis cum rege
laetus ad convivium. Placuit ei consilium, et iussit excelsam parari
crucem.



MARDOCHAEUS A REGE HONORATUR.


6:1 Noctem illam duxit rex insomnem, iussitque sibi afferri historias
et annales priorum temporum. Quae cum illo praesente legerentur,

6:2 ventum est ad illum locum ubi scriptum erat quo modo nunciasset
Mardochaeus insidias Bagathan, et Thares eunuchorum, regem Assuerum
iugulare cupientium.

6:3 Quod cum audisset rex, ait: Quid pro hac fide honoris ac praemii
Mardochaeus consecutus est? Dixerunt ei servi illius ac ministri:
Nihil omnino mercedis accepit.

6:4 Statimque rex, Quis est, inquit, in atrio? Aman quippe interius
atrium domus regiae intraverat, ut suggereret regi, et iuberet
Mardochaeum affigi patibulo, quod ei fuerat praeparatum.

6:5 Responderunt pueri: Aman stat in atrio. Dixitque rex: Ingrediatur.

6:6 Cumque esset ingressus, ait illi: Quid debet fieri viro, quem rex
honorare desiderat? Cogitans autem in corde suo Aman, et reputans quod
nullum alium rex, nisi se, vellet honorare,

6:7 respondit: Homo, quem rex honorare cupit,

6:8 debet indui vestibus regiis, et imponi super equum, qui de sella
regis est, et accipere regium diadema super caput suum,

6:9 et primus de regiis principibus, ac tyrannis teneat equum eius, et
per plateam civitatis incedens clamet, et dicat: Sic honorabitur,
quemcumque voluerit rex honorare.

6:10 Dixitque ei rex: Festina, et sumpta stola et equo, fac, ut
locutus es, Mardochaeo Iudaeo, qui sedet ante fores palatii. Cave ne
quidquam de his, quae locutus es, praetermittas.

6:11 Tulit itaque Aman stolam et equum, indutumque Mardochaeum in
platea civitatis, et impositum equo praecedebat, atque clamabat: Hoc
honore condignus est, quemcumque rex voluerit honorare.

6:12 Reversusque est Mardochaeus ad ianuam palatii: et Aman festinavit
ire in domum suam, lugens et operto capite:

6:13 narravitque Zares uxori suae, et amicis omnia quae evenissent
sibi. Cui responderunt sapientes, quos habebat in consilio, et uxor
eius: Si de semine Iudaeorum est Mardochaeus, ante quem cadere
coepisti, non poteris ei resistere, sed cades in conspectu eius.



AMAN SUSPENDITUR ET MARDOCHAEUS PROMOVETUR.


6:14 Adhuc illis loquentibus, venerunt eunuchi regis, et cito eum ad
convivium, quod regina paraverat, pergere compulerunt.

7:1 Intravit itaque rex et Aman, ut biberent cum regina.

7:2 Dixitque ei rex etiam secunda die, postquam vino incaluerat: Quae
est petitio tua Esther ut detur tibi? et quid vis fieri? etiam si
dimidiam partem regni mei petieris, impetrabis.

7:3 Ad quem illa respondit: Si inveni gratiam in oculis tuis o rex, et
si tibi placet, dona mihi animam meam pro qua rogo, et populum meum
pro quo obsecro.

7:4 Traditi enim sumus ego et populus meus, ut conteramur, iugulemur,
et pereamus. Atque utinam in servos et famulas venderemur: esset
tolerabile malum, et gemens tacerem: nunc autem hostis noster est,
cuius crudelitas redundat in regem.

7:5 Respondensque rex Assuerus ait: Quis est iste, et cuius potentiae,
ut haec audeat facere?

7:6 Dixitque Esther: Hostis et inimicus noster pessimus iste est Aman.
Quod ille audiens, illico obstupuit, vultum regis ac reginae ferre non
sustinens.

7:7 Rex autem iratus surrexit, et de loco convivii intravit in hortum
arboribus consitum. Aman quoque surrexit ut rogaret Esther reginam pro
anima sua, intellexit enim a rege sibi paratum malum.

7:8 Qui cum reversus esset de horto nemoribus consito, et intrasset
convivii locum, reperit Aman super lectulum corruisse, in quo iacebat
Esther, et ait: Etiam reginam vult opprimere, me praesente, in domo
mea. Necdum verbum de ore regis exierat, et statim operuerunt faciem
eius.

7:9 Dixitque Harbona, unus de eunuchis, qui stabant in ministerio
regis: En lignum, quod paraverat Mardochaeo, qui locutus est pro rege,
stat in domo Aman, habens altitudinis quinquaginta cubitos. Cui dixit
rex: Appendite eum in eo.

7:10 Suspensus est itaque Aman in patibulo quod paraverat Mardochaeo:
et regis ira quievit.

8:1 Die illo dedit rex Assuerus Esther reginae domum Aman adversarii
Iudaeorum, et Mardochaeus ingressus est ante faciem regis. Confessa
est enim ei Esther quod esset patruus suus.

8:2 Tulitque rex annulum, quem ab Aman recipi iusserat, et tradidit
Mardochaeo. Esther autem constituit Mardochaeum super domum suam.



EDICTUM EDICTO REPELLITUR.


8:3 Nec his contenta, procidit ad pedes regis, flevitque et locuta ad
eum oravit ut malitiam Aman Agagitae, et machinationes eius pessimas,
quas excogitaverat contra Iudaeos, iuberet irritas fieri.

8:4 At ille ex more sceptrum aureum protendit manu, quo signum
clementiae monstrabatur: illaque consurgens stetit ante eum,

8:5 et ait: Si placet regi, et si inveni gratiam in oculis eius, et
deprecatio mea non ei videtur esse contraria, obsecro, ut novis
epistolis, veteres Aman litterae, insidiatoris et hostis Iudaeorum,
quibus eos in cunctis regis provinciis perire praeceperat,
corrigantur.

8:6 Quo modo enim potero sustinere necem et interfectionem populi mei?

8:7 Responditque rex Assuerus Esther reginae, et Mardochaeo Iudaeo:
Domum Aman concessi Esther, et ipsum iussi affigi cruci, quia ausus
est manum mittere in Iudaeos.

8:8 Scribite ergo Iudaeis, sicut vobis placet, regis nomine, signantes
litteras annulo meo. Haec enim consuetudo erat, ut epistolis, quae ex
regis nomine mittebantur, et illius annulo signatae erant, nemo
auderet contradicere.

8:9 Accitisque scribis et librariis regis (erat autem tempus tertii
mensis, qui appellatur Siban) vigesima et tertia die illius scriptae
sunt epistolae, ut Mardochaeus voluerat, ad Iudaeos, et ad principes,
procuratoresque et iudices, qui centum vigintiseptem provinciis ab
India usque ad Aethiopiam praesidebant: provinciae atque provinciae,
populo et populo iuxta linguas et litteras suas, et Iudaeis, prout
legere poterant, et audire.

8:10 Ipsaeque epistolae, quae regis nomine mittebantur, annulo ipsius
obsignatae sunt, et missae per veredarios: qui per omnes provincias
discurrentes, veteres litteras novis nunciis praevenirent.

8:11 Quibus imperavit rex, ut convenirent Iudaeos per singulas
civitates, et in unum praeciperent congregari ut starent pro animabus
suis, et omnes inimicos suos cum coniugibus ac liberis et universis
domibus, interficerent atque delerent, et spolia eorum diriperent.

8:12 Et constituta est per omnes provincias una ultionis dies, id est
tertiadecima mensis duodecimi Adar.



ALTERA EPISTOLA XERXIS.


E:1 [16:1] Rex magnus Artaxerxes ab India usque Aethiopiam centum
vigintiseptem provinciarum ducibus ac principibus, qui nostrae
iussioni obediunt, salutem dicit.

E:2 [16:2] Multi bonitate principum et honore, qui in eos collatus
est, abusi sunt in superbiam:

E:3 [16:3] et non solum subiectos regibus nituntur opprimere, sed
datam sibi gloriam non ferentes, in ipsos, qui dederunt, moliuntur
insidias.

E:4 [16:4] Nec contenti sunt gratias non agere beneficiis, et
humanitatis in se iura violare, sed Dei quoque cuncta cernentis
arbitrantur se posse fugere sententiam.

E:5 [16:5] Et in tantum vesaniae proruperunt, ut eos, qui credita sibi
officia diligenter observant, et ita cuncta agunt ut omnium laude
digni sint, mendaciorum cuniculis conentur subvertere,

E:6 [16:6] dum aures principum simplices, et ex sua natura alios
aestimantes, callida fraude decipiunt.

E:7 [16:7] Quae res et ex veteribus probatur historiis, et ex his,
quae geruntur quotidie, quo modo malis quorumdam suggestionibus regum
studia depraventur.

E:8 [16:8] Unde providendum est paci omnium provinciarum.

E:9 [16:9] Nec putare debetis, si diversa iubeamus, ex animi nostri
venire levitate, sed pro qualitate et necessitate temporum, ut
reipublicae poscit utilitas, ferre sententiam.

E:10 [16:10] Et ut manifestius quod dicimus, intelligatis, Aman filius
Amadathi, et animo et gente Macedo, alienusque a Persarum sanguine, et
pietatem nostram sua crudelitate commaculans, peregrinus a nobis
susceptus est:

E:11 [16:11] et tantam in se expertus humanitatem, ut pater noster
vocaretur, et adoraretur ab omnibus post regem secundus:

E:12 [16:12] qui in tantum arrogantiae tumorem sublatus est, ut regno
privare nos niteretur et spiritu.

E:13 [16:13] Nam Mardochaeum, cuius fide et beneficiis vivimus, et
consortem regni nostri Esther cum omni gente sua novis quibusdam atque
inauditis machinis expetivit in mortem:

E:14 [16:14] hoc cogitans ut illis interfectis, insidiaretur nostrae
solitudini, et regnum Persarum transferret in Macedonas.

E:15 [16:15] Nos autem a pessimo mortalium Iudaeos neci destinatos, in
nulla penitus culpa reperimus, sed econtrario iustis utentes legibus,

E:16 [16:16] et filios altissimi et maximi, semperque viventis Dei,
cuius beneficio et patribus nostris et nobis regnum est traditum, et
usque hodie custoditur.

E:17 [16:17] Unde eas litteras, quas sub nomine nostro ille direxerat,
sciatis esse irritas.

E:18 [16:18] Pro quo scelere ante portas huius urbis, id est, Susan,
et ipse qui machinatus est, et omnis cognatio eius pendet in
patibulis: non nobis, sed Deo reddente ei quod meruit.

E:19 [16:19] Hoc autem edictum, quod nunc mittimus, in cunctis urbibus
proponatur, ut liceat Iudaeis uti legibus suis.

E:20 [16:20] Quibus debetis esse adminiculo, ut eos, qui se ad necem
eorum paraverant, possint interficere tertiadecima die mensis
duodecimi, qui vocatur Adar.

E:21 [16:21] hanc enim diem, Deus omnipotens, moeroris et luctus, eis
vertit in gaudium.

E:22 [16:22] Unde et vos inter ceteros festos dies, hanc habetote
diem, et celebrate eam cum omni laetitia, ut et in posterum
cognoscatur,

E:23 [16:23] onmes, qui fideliter Persis obediunt, dignam pro fide
recipere mercedem: qui autem insidiantur regno eorum, perire pro
scelere.

E:24 [16:24] Omnis autem provincia et civitas, quae noluerit
sollemnitatis huius esse particeps, gladio et igne pereat, et sic
deleatur, ut non solum hominibus, sed etiam bestiis invia sit in
sempiternum, pro exemplo contemptus, et inobedientiae.

8:13 Summaque epistolae haec fuit, ut in omnibus terris ac populis,
qui regis Assueri subiacebant imperio, notum fieret, paratos esse
Iudaeos ad capiendam vindictam de hostibus suis.

8:14 Egressique sunt veredarii celeres nuncia perferentes, et edictum
regis pependit in Susan.

8:15 Mardochaeus autem de palatio, et de conspectu regis egrediens,
fulgebat vestibus regiis, hyacinthinis videlicet et aeriis, coronam
auream portans in capite, et amictus serico pallio atque purpureo.
Omnisque civitas exultavit, atque laetata est.

8:16 Iudaeis autem nova lux oriri visa est, gaudium, honor, et
tripudium.

8:17 Apud omnes populos, urbes, atque provincias, quocumque regis
iussa veniebant, mira exultatio, epulae atque convivia, et festus
dies: in tantum ut plures alterius gentis et sectae eorum religioni et
ceremoniis iungerentur. Grandis enim cunctos Iudaici nominis terror
invaserat.



IUDAEI AB INIMICIS SE VINDICANT.


9:1 Igitur duodecimi mensis, quem Adar vocari ante iam diximus,
tertiadecima die, quando cunctis Iudaeis interfectio parabatur, et
hostes eorum inhiabant sanguini, versa vice Iudaei superiores esse
coeperunt, et se de adversariis vindicare.

9:2 Congregatique sunt per singulas civitates, oppida, et loca ut
extenderent manum contra inimicos, et persecutores suos. Nullusque
ausus est resistere, eo quod omnes populos magnitudinis eorum formido
penetrarat.

9:3 Nam et provinciarum indices, et duces, et procuratores, omnisque
dignitas, quae singulis locis ac operibus praeerat, extollebant
Iudaeos timore Mardochaei:

9:4 quem principem esse palatii, et plurimum posse cognoverant: fama
quoque nominis eius crescebat quotidie, et per cunctorum ora
volitabat.

9:5 Itaque percusserunt Iudaei inimicos suos plaga magna, et
occiderunt eos, reddentes eis quod sibi paraverant facere:

9:6 in tantum ut etiam in Susan quingentos viros interficerent, extra
decem filios Aman Agagitae hostis Iudaeorum: quorum ista sunt nomina:

9:7 Pharsandatha, et Delphon, et Esphatha,

9:8 et Phoratha, et Adalia, et Aridatha,

9:9 et Phermesta et Arisai, et Aridai, et Iezatha.

9:10 Quos cum occidissent, praedas de substantiis eorum tangere
noluerunt.

9:11 Statimque numerus eorum, qui occisi erant in Susan, ad regem
relatus est.

9:12 Qui dixit reginae: In urbe Susan interfecerunt Iudaei quingentos
viros, et alios decem filios Aman: quantam putas eos exercere caedem
in universis provinciis? Quid ultra postulas, et quid vis ut fieri
iubeam?

9:13 Cui illa respondit: Si regi placet, detur potestas Iudaeis, ut
sicut fecerunt hodie in Susan, sic et cras faciant, et decem filii
Aman in patibulis suspendantur.

9:14 Praecepitque rex ut ita fieret. Statimque in Susan pependit
edictum, et decem filii Aman suspensi sunt.

9:15 Congregatis Iudaeis quartadecima die mensis Adar, interfecti sunt
in Susan trecenti viri: nec eorum ab illis direpta substantia est.

9:16 Sed et per omnes provincias, quae ditioni regis subiacebant, pro
animabus suis steterunt Iudaei, interfectis hostibus ac persecutoribus
suis: in tantum ut septuagintaquinque millia occisorum implerentur, et
nullus de substantiis eorum quidquam contingeret.

9:17 Dies autem tertiusdecimus mensis Adar primus apud omnes
interfectionis fuit, et quartadecima die caedere desierunt. Quem
constituerunt esse sollemnem, ut in eo omni tempore deinceps vacarent
epulis, gaudio atque conviviis.

9:18 At hi, qui in urbe Susan caedem exercuerant, tertiodecimo et
quartodecimo die eiusdem mensis in caede versati sunt: quintodecimo
autem die percutere desierunt. Et idcirco eundem diem constituerunt
sollemnem epularum atque laetitiae.

9:19 Hi vero Iudaei, qui in oppidis non muratis ac villis morabantur,
quartumdecimum diem mensis Adar conviviorum et gaudii decreverunt, ita
ut exultent in eo, et mittant sibi mutuo partes epularum et ciborum.



CELEBRATIO FESTI PHURIM SANCITUR.


9:20 Scripsit itaque Mardochaeus omnia haec, et litteris comprehensa
misit ad Iudaeos, qui in omnibus regis provinciis morabantur, tam in
vicino positis, quam  procul,

9:21 ut quartamdecimam et quintamdecimam diem mensis Adar pro festis
susciperent, et revertente semper anno sollemni celebrarent honore:

9:22 quia in ipsis diebus se ulti sunt Iudaei de inimicis suis, et
luctus atque tristitia in hilaritatem gaudiumque conversa sunt,
essentque dies isti epularum atque laetitiae, et mitterent sibi
invicem ciborum partes, et pauperibus munuscula largirentur.

9:23 Susceperuntque Iudaei in sollemnem ritum cuncta quae eo tempore
facere coeperant, et quae Mardochaeus litteris facienda mandaverat.

9:24 Aman enim, filius Amadathi stirpis Agag, hostis et adversarius
Iudaeorum, cogitavit contra eos malum, ut occideret illos, atque
deleret: et misit phur, quod nostra lingua vertitur in sortem.

9:25 Et postea ingressa est Esther ad regem, obsecrans ut conatus
eius, litteris regis irriti fierent: et malum, quod contra Iudaeos
cogitaverat, reverteretur in caput eius. Denique et ipsum et filios
eius affixerunt cruci,

9:26 atque ex illo tempore dies isti appellati sunt phurim, id est
sortium: eo quod phur, id est sors, in urnam missa fuerit. Et cuncta,
quae gesta sunt, epistolae, id est libri huius volumine continentur:

9:27 quaeque sustinuerunt, et quae deinceps immutata sunt, susceperunt
Iudaei super se et semen suum, et super cunctos, qui religioni eorum
voluerunt copulari, ut nulli liceat duos hos dies absque sollemnitate
transigere: quos scriptura testatur, et certa expetunt tempora, annis
sibi iugiter succedentibus.

9:28 Isti sunt dies, quos nulla umquam delebit oblivio: et per
singulas generationes cunctae in toto orbe provinciae celebrabunt: nec
est ulla civitas, in qua dies phurim, id est sortium, non observentur
a Iudaeis, et ab eorum progenie, quae his ceremoniis obligata est.

9:29 Scripseruntque Esther regina filia Abihail, et Mardochaeus
Iudaeus etiam secundam epistolam, ut omni studio dies ista sollemnis
sanciretur in posterum.

9:30 et miserunt ad omnes Iudaeos, qui in centum viginti septem
provinciis regis Assueri versabantur, ut haberent pacem, et
susciperent veritatem,

9:31 observantes Dies sortium, et suo tempore cum gaudio celebrarent:
sicut constituerant Mardochaeus et Esther, et illi observanda
susceperunt a se, et a semine suo ieiunia, et clamores, et Sortium
dies,

9:32 et omnia, quae libri huius, qui vocatur Esther, historia
continentur.



SUMMA DIGNITAS MARDOCHAEI.


10:1 Rex vero Assuerus omnem terram, et cunctas maris insulas fecit
tributarias:

10:2 cuius fortitudo et imperium, et dignitas atque sublimitas, qua
exaltavit Mardochaeum, scripta sunt in libris Medorum, atque Persarum:

10:3 et quomodo Mardochaeus Iudaici generis secundus a rege Assuero
fuerit: et magnus apud Iudaeos et acceptabilis plebi fratrum suorum,
quaerens bona populo suo, et loquens ea, quae ad pacem seminis sui
pertinerent.



SOMNIUM MARDOCHAEI EXPLICATUR.


F:1 [10:4] Dixitque Mardochaeus: A Deo facta sunt ista.

F:2 [10:5] Recordatus sum somnii, quod videram, haec eadem
significantis: nec eorum quidquam irritum fuit.

F:3 [10:6] Parvus fons, qui crevit in fluvium, et in lucem, solemque
conversus est, et in aquas plurimas redundavit: Esther est, quam rex
accepit uxorem, et voluit esse reginam.

F:4 [10:7] Duo autem dracones: ego sum, et Aman.

F:5 [10:8] Gentes, quae convenerant: hi sunt, qui conati sunt delere
nomen Iudaeorum.

F:6 [10:9] Gens autem mea: Israel est, quae clamavit ad Dominum, et
salvum fecit Dominus populum suum: liberavitque nos ab omnibus malis,
et fecit signa magna atque portenta inter Gentes:

F:7 [10:10] et duas sortes esse praecepit, unam Populi Dei, et alteram
cunctarum Gentium.

F:8 [10:11] Venitque utraque sors in statutum ex illo iam tempore diem
coram Deo universis gentibus:

F:9 [10:12] et recordatus est Dominus populi sui, ac misertus est
hereditatis suae.

F:10 [10:13] Et observabuntur dies isti in mense Adar quartadecima, et
quintadecima die eiusdem mensis, cum omni studio, et gaudio in unum
coetum populi congregati, in cunctas deinceps generationes populi
Israel.



LIBER ESTHER IN AEGYPTUM FERTUR.


F:11 [11:1] Anno quarto regnantibus Ptolemaeo, et Cleopatra,
attulerunt Dosithaeus, qui se Sacerdotem, et Levitici generis ferebat,
et Ptolemaeus filius eius hanc epistolam phurim, quam dixerunt
interpretatum esse Lysimachum Ptolemaei filium in Ierusalem.







About This Electronic Edition:

  The editor has assembled this etext to approximate the arrangement of
the Greek Septuagint version of Esther.  The Vulgate contains sections
both from the Hebrew and Greek versions, but the verses exclusive to
the Greek were transplanted to the end.  These verses are specific to
different events in the story of Esther.  Placed out of the context of
the body of book, as in the Vulgate, these verses can make for
difficult reading.  The guide for this arrangement of the text is "The
New American Bible". [NAB] Thomas Nelson Publishers: Nashville 1987.
The chaper:verse numbers follow this edition with a few exceptions.
Verse 15:1 is a restatement of verse 4:8b and may have been added to
the Vulgate to put the following verses in context; it is not in the
NAB.  After much thought the editor has decided to label it verse
B:7.5 even though it is an awkward designation.  Verse 4:17 is left
unnumbered in the NAB; in this text it is verse C:0.  In a few
instances verses were divided into "a" and "b" sections.  None of verses
included in the source text has been removed from this edition. The
editor has removed the footnotes & appendices and modified the section
headers.  A few new section headers have been added, based on the text
of the source's marginal notes.

I have transcribed from this source as accurately as possible for
this e-text, with the following changes:
1) I formatted each verse into a separate line and added the chapter
number to each verse number.  In doing this I lost the source's
paragraph structure.
2) I exploded the ligatures for "ae" and "oe" into two characters
rather than one character for each diphthong.
3) I capitalized all of the section headings which were either in
bold or italicized print originally.  These sections headings may
not be original to the Vulgate, but then neither are verse numbers.
4) I have included alternate line numbers in the headers to the
sections translated from the Greek Sepuagint version.  These
alternate chater/verse numbers correspond to the numbering of these
sections in the New American Bible, which follows the Septuagint
arrangement, rather than the Vulgate arrangement which places all
of those sections at the end.
5) In all references to verses I used a colon to separate the
chapter number and verse number rather than a comma as in the source.
6) I placed the footnote designators in parentheses and re-lettered
them for the whole body of the text.  The original recycled to "a"
for each new page.  I also arranged the cross reference footnotes
themselves into one chart at the end of the text.
7) I moved the marginal notations into an appendix.

Please note that some sentence-like sections end with a period, but
the following line does not begin with a capital letter.  I recommend
that this format remain.  The source's editor seems to have been
quite confident in the propriety of this approach.  I have retained
all of the source's capitalization and punctuation except for the
section headers.

65 is the target line length, but because of the length of many
of the Latin words, my desire not to create "orphan" words, and
a genuine lack of talent on the part of the transcriber for such
matters, the margination is rather ragged.

I. PERICULUM IUDAEORUM, 1:1-4:17.


1. REGINA VASTHI EICITUR, 1:1-22.


1:1 In diebus Assueri, qui regnavit ab India usque Aethiopiam
super centum viginti septem provincias:

1:2 quando sedit in solio regni sui, Susan civitas regni eius
exordium fuit.

1:3 Tertio igitur anno imperii sui fecit grande convivium cunctis
principibus, et pueris suis, fortissimis Persarum, et Medorum inclytis,
et praefectis provinciarum coram se,

1:4 ut ostenderet divitias gloriae regni sui, ac magnitudinem,
atque iactantiam potentiae suae, multo tempore, centum videlicet
et octoginta diebus.

1:5 Cumque implerentur dies convivii, invitavit omnem populum,
qui inventus est in Susan, a maximo usque ad minimum: et iussit
septem diebus convivium praeparari in vestibulo horti, et nemoris,
quod regio cultu et manu consitum erat.

1:6 Et pendebant ex omni parte tentoria aerii coloris et carbasini
ac hyacinthini, sustentata funibus byssinis, atque purpureis,
qui eburneis circulis inserti erant, et columnis marmoreis fulciebantur.
Lectuli quoque aurei et argentei, super pavimentum smaragdino et pario
stratum lapide, dispositi erant: quod mira varietate pictura decorabat.

1:7 Bibebant autem qui invitati erant, aureis poculis, et aliis
atque aliis vasis cibi inferebantur.  Vinum quoque, ut magnificentia
regia dignum erat, abundans, et praecipuum ponebatur.

1:8 Nec erat qui nolentes cogeret ad bibendum, sed sicut rex statuerat,
praeponens mensis singulos de principibus suis ut sumeret unusquisque
quod vellet.

1:9 Vasthi quoque regina fecit convivium feminarum in palatio,
ubi rex Assuerus manere consueverat.

1:10 Itaque die septimo, cum rex esset hilarior, et post nimiam
potationem incaluisset mero, praecepit Maumam, et Bazatha, et Harbona,
et Bagatha et Abgatha, et Zethar, et Charchas, septem eunuchis,
qui in conspectu eius ministrabant,

1:11 ut introducerent reginam Vasthi coram rege, posito super caput
eius diademate, ut ostenderet cunctis populis et principibus
pulchritudinem illius: erat enim pulchra valde.

1:12 Quae renuit, et ad regis imperium, quod per eunuchos mandaverat,
venire contempsit.  Unde iratus rex, et nimio furore succensus,

1:13 interrogavit sapientes, qui ex more regio semper ei aderant,
et illorum faciebat cuncta consilio, scientium leges, ac iura maiorum:

(1:14 erant autem primi et proximi, Charsena, et Sethar, et Admatha,
et Tharsis, et Mares, et Marsana, et Mamuchan, septem duces Persarum,
atque Medorum, qui videbant faciem regis, et primi post eum residere
soliti erant)

1:15 cui sententiae Vasthi regina subiaceret, quae Assueri regis
imperium, quod per eunuchos mandaverat, facere noluisset.

1:16 Responditque Mamuchan, audiente rege, atque principibus,
Non solum regem laesit regina Vasthi, sed et omnes populos,
et principes, qui sunt in cunctis provinciis regis Assueri.

1:17 Egredietur enim sermo reginae ad omnes mulieres, ut contemnant
viros suos, et dicant: Rex Assuerus iussit ut regina Vasthi intraret
ad eum, et illa noluit.

1:18 Atque hoc exemplo omnes principum coniuges Persarum atque Medorum,
parvipendent imperia maritorum: unde regis iusta est indignatio.

1:19 Si tibi placet, egrediatur edictum a facie tua, et scribatur
iuxta legem Persarum atque Medorum, quam praeteriri illicitum est,
ut nequaquam ultra Vasthi ingrediatur ad regem, sed regnum illius,
altera, quae melior est illa, accipiat.

1:20 Et hoc in omne (quod latissimum est) provinciarum tuarum
divulgetur imperium, et cunctae uxores tam maiorum, quam minorum
deferant maritis suis honorem.

1:21 placuit consilium eius regi, et principibus: fecitque rex iuxta
consilium Mamuchan,

1:22 et misit epistolas ad universas provincias regni sui, ut quaeque
gens audire et legere poterat, diversis linguis et litteris, esse viros
principes ac maiores in domibus suis: et hoc per cunctos populos divulgari.



2. ESTHER ELIGITUR REGINA, 2:1-18.


2:1 His ita gestis, postquam regis Assueri indignatio deferbuerat,
recordatus est Vasthi, et quae fecisset, vel quae passa esset:

2:2 dixeruntque pueri regis, ac ministri eius: Quaerantur regi
puellae virgines ac speciosae,

2:3 et mittantur qui considerent per universas provincias puellas
speciosas et virgines: et adducant eas ad civitatem Susan, et tradant
eas in domum feminarum sub manu Egei eunuchi, qui est praepositus
et custos mulierum regiarum: et accipiant mundum muliebrem, et cetera
ad usus necessaria.

2:4 Et quaecumque inter omnes oculis regis placuerit, ipsa regnet
pro Vasthi.  Placuit sermo regi: et ita, ut suggesserant, iussit fieri.

2:5 Erat vir Iudaeus in Susan civitate, vocabulo Mardochaeus
filius Iair, filii Semei, filii Cis, de stirpe Iemini,

2:6 (a) qui translatus fuerat de Ierusalem eo tempore, quo Iechoniam
regem Iuda Nabuchodonosor rex Babylonis transtulerat,

2:7 qui fuit nutritius filiae fratris sui Edissae, quae altero
nomine vocabatur Esther: et utrumque parentem amiserat: pulchra nimis,
et decora facie.  Mortuisque patre eius ac matre, Mardochaeus sibi eam
adoptavit in filiam.

2:8 Cumque percrebruisset regis imperium, et iuxta mandatum illius
multae pulchrae virgines adducerentur Susan, et Egeo traderentur
Eunucho; Esther quoque inter ceteras puellas ei tradita est,
ut servaretur in numero feminarum.

2:9 Quae placuit ei, et invenit gratiam in conspectu illius.
Et praecepit eunucho, ut acceleraret mundum muliebrem, et traderet
ei partes suas, et septem puellas speciosissimas de domo regis,
et tam ipsam, quam pedissequas eius ornaret atque excoleret.

2:10 Quae noluit indicare ei populum et patriam suam:
Mardochaeus enim praeceperat ei, ut de hac re omnino reticeret:

2:11 qui deambulabat quotidie ante vestibulum domus, in qua electae
virgines servabantur, curam agens salutis Esther, et scire volens
quid ei accideret.

2:12 Cum autem venisset tempus singularum per ordinem puellarum,
ut intrarent ad regem, expletis omnibus, quae ad cultum muliebrem
pertinebant, mensis duodecimus vertebatur: ita dumtaxat, ut sex
mensibus oleo ungerentur myrrhino, et aliis sex quibusdam pigmentis
et aromatibus uterentur.

2:13 Ingredientesque ad regem, quidquid postulassent ad ornatum
pertinens, accipiebant: et ut eis placuerat, compositae de triclinio
feminarum ad regis cubiculum transibant.

2:14 Et quae intraverat vespere, egrediebatur mane, atque inde in
secundas aedes deducebatur, quae sub manu Susagazi eunuchi erant,
qui concubinis regis praesidebat: nec habebat potestatem ad regem
ultra redeundi, nisi voluisset rex, et eam venire iussisset ex nomine.

2:15 Evoluto autem tempore per ordinem, instabat dies, quo Esther
filia Abihail fratris Mardochaei, quam sibi adoptaverat in filiam,
deberet intrare ad regem.  Quae non quaesivit muliebrem cultum,
sed quaecumque voluit Egeus eunuchus custos virginum, haec ei ad
ornatum dedit.  Erat enim formosa valde, et incredibili pulchritudine,
omnium oculis gratiosa et amabilis videbatur.

2:16 Ducta est itaque ad cubiculum regis Assueri mense decimo,
qui vocatur Tebeth, septimo anno regni eius.

2:17 Et adamavit eam rex plus quam omnes mulieres, habuitque gratiam
et misericordiam coram eo super omnes mulieres, et posuit diadema
regni in capite eius, fecitque eam regnare in loco Vasthi.

2:18 Et iussit convivium praeparari permagnificum cunctis principibus,
et servis suis pro coniunctione, et nuptiis Esther.  Et dedit requiem
universis provinciis, ac dona largitus est iuxta magnificentiam principalem.



3. MARDOCHAEUS CONIURATIONEM IANITORUM PATEFACIT, 2:19-23.


2:19 Cumque secundo quaererentur virgines et congregarentur,
Mardochaeus manebat ad ianuam regis:

2:20 necdum prodiderat Esther patriam, et populum suum, iuxta
mandatum eius.  Quidquid enim ille praecipiebat, observabat Esther:
et ita cuncta faciebat ut eo tempore solita erat, quo eam
parvulam nutriebat.

2:21 Eo igitur tempore, quo Mardochaeus ad regis ianuam morabatur,
irati sunt Bagathan, et Thares duo eunuchi regis, qui ianitores erant,
et in primo palatii limine praesidebant: volueruntque insurgere
in regem, et occidere eum.

2:22 Quod Mardochaeum non latuit, statimque nunciavit reginae Esther:
et illa regi ex nomine Mardochaei, qui ad se rem detulerat.

2:23 Quaesitum est, et inventum: et appensus est uterque eorum
in patibulo.  Mandatumque est historiis, et annalibus traditum
coram rege.



4. AMAN POPULUM IUDAEORUM PERDERE VULT, 3:1-15.


3:1 Post haec rex Assuerus exaltavit Aman filium Amadathi, qui erat
de stirpe Agag: et posuit solium eius super omnes principes, quos habebat.

3:2 Cunctique servi regis, qui in foribus palatii versabantur,
flectebant genua, et adorabant Aman: sic enim praeceperat eis imperator.
solus Mardochaeus non flectebat genu, neque adorabat eum.

3:3 Cui dixerunt pueri regis, qui ad fores palatii praesidebant:
Cur praeter ceteros non observas mandatum regis?

3:4 Cumque hoc crebrius dicerent, et ille nollet audire,
nunciaverunt Aman, scire cupientes utrum perseveraret in sententia:
dixerat enim eis se esse Iudaeum.

3:5 Quod cum audisset Aman, et experimento probasset quod Mardochaeus
non flecteret sibi genu, nec se adoraret, iratus est valde,

3:6 et pro nihilo duxit in unum Mardochaeum mittere manus suas:
audierat enim quod esset gentis Iudaeae. magisque voluit omnem Iudaeorum,
qui erant in regno Assueri, perdere nationem.

3:7 Mense primo (cuius vocabulum est Nisan) anno duodecimo regni Assueri,
missa est sors in urnam, quae Hebraice dicitur phur, coram Aman,
quo die et quo mense gens Iudaeorum deberet interfici: et exivit
mensis duodecimus, qui vocatur Adar.

3:8 Dixitque Aman regi Assuero: Est populus per omnes provincias
regni tui dispersus, et a se mutuo separatus, novis utens legibus
et ceremoniis, insuper et regis scita contemnens.  Et optime
nosti quod non expediat regno tuo ut insolescat per licentiam.

3:9 si tibi placet, decerne, ut pereat, et decem millia talentorum
appendam arcariis gazae tuae.

3:10 Tulit ergo rex annulum, quo utebatur, de manu sua, et dedit
eum Aman filio Amadathi de progenie Agag, hosti Iudaeorum,

3:11 dixitque ad eum: Argentum, quod tu polliceris, tuum sit.
de populo age quod tibi placet.

3:12 Vocatique sunt scribae regis mense primo Nisan, tertiadecima
die eiusdem mensis: et scriptum est, ut iusserat Aman, ad omnes
satrapas regis, et iudices provinciarum, diversarumque gentium,
ut quaeque gens legere poterat, et audire pro varietate linguarum
ex nomine regis Assueri: et litterae signatae ipsius annulo,

3:13 missae sunt per cursores regis ad universas provincias ut
occiderent atque delerent omnes Iudaeos, a puero usque ad senem,
parvulos, et mulieres, uno die, hoc est tertiodecimo mensis duodecimi,
qui vocatur Adar, et bona eorum diriperent.

3:14 Summa autem epistolarum haec fuit, ut omnes provinciae scirent,
et pararent se ad praedictam diem.

3:15 Festinabant cursores, qui missi erant, regis imperium explere.
Statimque in Susan pependit edictum, rege et Aman celebrante convivium,
et cunctis Iudaeis, qui in urbe erant, flentibus.



5. MARDOCHAEUS REGINAM INVOCAT, 4:1-17.


4:1 Quae cum audisset Mardochaeus, scidit vestimenta sua, et indutus
est sacco, spargens cinerem capiti: et in platea mediae civitatis
voce magna clamabat, ostendens amaritudinem animi sui,

4:2 et hoc eiulatu usque ad fores palatii gradiens.  Non enim erat
licitum indutum sacco aulam regis intrare.

4:3 In omnibus quoque provinciis, oppidis, ac locis, ad quae crudele
regis dogma pervenerat, planctus ingens erat apud Iudaeos, ieiunium,
ululatus, et fletus, sacco et cinere multis pro strato utentibus.

4:4 Ingressae autem sunt puellae Esther et eunuchi, nunciaveruntque ei.
Quod audiens consternata est: et vestem misit, ut ablato sacco
induerent eum: quam accipere noluit.

4:5 Accitoque Athach eunucho, quem rex ministrum ei dederat,
praecepit ei ut iret ad Mardochaeum, et disceret ab eo cur hoc faceret.

4:6 Egressusque Athach, ivit ad Mardochaeum stantem in platea civitatis,
ante ostium palatii:

4:7 qui indicavit ei omnia, quae acciderant, quo modo Aman promisisset,
ut in thesauros regis pro Iudaeorum nece inferret argentum.

4:8 exemplar quoque edicti, quod pendebat in Susan, dedit ei,
ut reginae ostenderet, et moneret eam, ut intraret ad regem,
et deprecaretur eum pro populo suo.

4:9 Regressus Athach, nunciavit Esther omnia, quae Mardochaeus dixerat.

4:10 Quae repondit ei, et iussit ut diceret Mardochaeo:

4:11 Omnes servi regis, et cunctae, quae sub ditione eius sunt,
norunt provinciae, quod sive vir, sive mulier non vocatus,
interius atrium regis intraverit, absque ulla cunctatione statim
interficiatur: nisi forte rex auream virgam ad eum tetenderit pro
signo clementiae, atque ita possit vivere.  Ego igitur quo modo ad
regem intrare potero, quae triginta iam diebus non sum vocata ad eum?

4:12 Quod cum audisset Mardochaeus,

4:13 rursum mandavit Esther, dicens: Ne putes quod animam tuam
tantum liberes, quia in domo regis es prae cunctis Iudaeis:

4:14 si enim nunc silueris, per aliam occasionem liberabuntur Iudaei:
et tu, et domus patris tui peribitis.  Et quis novit utrum idcirco ad
regnum veneris, ut in tali tempore parareris?

4:15 Rursumque Esther haec Mardochaeo verba mandavit:

4:16 Vade et congrega omnes Iudaeos, quos in Susan repereris,
et orate pro me.  Non comedatis, et non bibatis tribus diebus,
et tribus noctibus: et ego cum ancillis meis similiter ieiunabo,
et tunc ingrediar ad regem contra legem faciens, non vocata,
tradensque me morti et periculo.

4:17 Ivit itaque Mardochaeus, et fecit omnia, quae ei Esther praeceperat.



II. SALUS IUDAEORUM, 5:1-10:3.


1. ESTHER A XERXE BENIGNE SUSCIPITUR, 5:1-8.


5:1 Die autem tertio induta est Esther regalibus vestimentis,
et stetit in atrio domus regiae, quod erat interius, contra
basilicam regis: at ille sedebat super solium suum in consistorio
palatii contra ostium domus.

5:2 Cumque vidisset Esther reginam stantem, placuit oculis eius,
et extendit contra eam virgam auream, quam tenebat manu:
Quae accedens, osculata est summitatem virgae eius:

5:3 Dixitque ad eam rex: Quid vis Esther regina? quae est petitio tua?
etiam si dimidiam partem regni petieris, dabitur tibi.

5:4 At illa respondit: Si regi placet, obsecro ut venias ad me hodie,
et Aman tecum ad convivium, quod paravi.

5:5 Statimque Rex, Vocate, inquit, cito Aman ut Esther obediat voluntati.
Venerunt itaque rex et Aman ad convivium, quod eis regina paraverat.

5:6 Dixitque ei rex, postquam vinum biberat abundanter: Quid petis
ut detur tibi? et pro qua re postulas? etiam si dimidiam partem
regni mei petieris, impetrabis.

5:7 Cui respondit Esther: Petitio mea, et preces sunt istae:

5:8 Si inveni in conspectu regis gratiam, et si regi placet ut det
mihi quod postulo, et meam impleat petitionem: veniat rex et Aman
ad convivium quod paravi eis, et cras aperiam regi voluntatem meam.



2. AMAN PRO MARDOCHAEO PATIBULUM PARAT, 5:9-14.


5:9 Egressus est itaque illo die Aman laetus et alacer.
Cumque vidisset Mardochaeum sedentem ante fores palatii,
et non solum non assurrexisse sibi, sed nec motum quidem
de loco sessionis suae, indignatus est valde:

5:10 et dissimulata ira, reversus in domum suam, convocavit ad se
amicos suos, et Zares uxorem suam:

5:11 et exposuit illis magnitudinem divitiarum suarum,
filiorumque turbam, et quanta eum gloria super omnes principes
et servos suos rex elevasset.

5:12 Et post haec ait: Regina quoque Esther nullum alium vocavit
ad convivium cum rege, praeter me: apud quam etiam cras cum rege
pransurus sum.

5:13 Et cum haec omnia habeam, nihil me habere puto, quamdiu videro
Mardochaeum Iudaeum sedentem ante fores regias.

5:14 Responderuntque ei Zales uxor eius, et ceteri amici:
Iube parari excelsam trabem, habentem altitudinis quinquaginta cubitos,
et dic mane regi ut appendatur super eam Mardochaeus,
et sic ibis cum rege laetus ad convivium.  Placuit ei consilium,
et iussit excelsam parari crucem.



3. MARDOCHAEUS A REGE HONORATUR, 6:1-13.


6:1 Noctem illam duxit rex insomnem, iussitque sibi afferri historias
et annales priorum temporum.  Quae cum illo praesente legerentur,

6:2 ventum est ad illum locum ubi scriptum erat quo modo nunciasset
Mardochaeus insidias Bagathan, et Thares eunuchorum, regem Assuerum
iugulare cupientium.

6:3 Quod cum audisset rex, ait: Quid pro hac fide honoris ac praemii
Mardochaeus consecutus est?  Dixerunt ei servi illius ac ministri:
Nihil omnino mercedis accepit.

6:4 Statimque rex, Quis est, inquit, in atrio?  Aman quippe interius
atrium domus regiae intraverat, ut suggereret regi, et iuberet
Mardochaeum affigi patibulo, quod ei fuerat praeparatum.

6:5 Responderunt pueri: Aman stat in atrio.  Dixitque rex: Ingrediatur.

6:6 Cumque esset ingressus, ait illi: Quid debet fieri viro, quem rex
honorare desiderat?  Cogitans autem in corde suo Aman, et reputans
quod nullum alium rex, nisi se, vellet honorare,

6:7 respondit: Homo, quem rex honorare cupit,

6:8 debet indui vestibus regiis, et imponi super equum, qui de sella
regis est, et accipere regium diadema super caput suum,

6:9 et primus de regiis principibus, ac tyrannis teneat equum eius,
et per plateam civitatis incedens clamet, et dicat: Sic honorabitur,
quemcumque voluerit rex honorare.

6:10 Dixitque ei rex: Festina, et sumpta stola et equo, fac, ut locutus es,
Mardochaeo Iudaeo, qui sedet ante fores palatii.  Cave ne quidquam de his,
quae locutus es, praetermittas.

6:11 Tulit itaque Aman stolam et equum, indutumque Mardochaeum in
platea civitatis, et impositum equo praecedebat, atque clamabat:
Hoc honore condignus est, quemcumque rex voluerit honorare.

6:12 Reversusque est Mardochaeus ad ianuam palatii: et Aman festinavit
ire in domum suam, lugens et operto capite:

6:13 narravitque Zares uxori suae, et amicis omnia quae evenissent sibi.
Cui responderunt sapientes, quos habebat in consilio, et uxor eius:
Si de semine Iudaeorum est Mardochaeus, ante quem cadere coepisti,
non poteris ei resistere, sed cades in conspectu eius.



4. AMAN SUSPENDITUR ET MARDOCHAEUS PROMOVETUR, 6:14-8:2.


6:14 Adhuc illis loquentibus, venerunt eunuchi regis, et cito eum
ad convivium, quod regina paraverat, pergere compulerunt.

7:1 Intravit itaque rex et Aman, ut biberent cum regina.

7:2 Dixitque ei rex etiam secunda die, postquam vino incaluerat:
Quae est petitio tua Esther ut detur tibi? et quid vis fieri?
etiam si dimidiam partem regni mei petieris, impetrabis.

7:3 Ad quem illa respondit: Si inveni gratiam in oculis tuis o rex,
et si tibi placet, dona mihi animam meam pro qua rogo, et populum
meum pro quo obsecro.

7:4 Traditi enim sumus ego et populus meus, ut conteramur, iugulemur,
et pereamus.  Atque utinam in servos et famulas venderemur:
esset tolerabile malum, et gemens tacerem: nunc autem hostis noster est,
cuius crudelitas redundat in regem.

7:5 Respondensque rex Assuerus ait: Quis est iste, et cuius potentiae,
ut haec audeat facere?

7:6 Dixitque Esther: Hostis et inimicus noster pessimus iste est Aman.
Quod ille audiens, illico obstupuit, vultum regis ac reginae ferre
non sustinens.

7:7 Rex autem iratus surrexit, et de loco convivii intravit in
hortum arboribus consitum.  Aman quoque surrexit ut rogaret Esther
reginam pro anima sua, intellexit enim a rege sibi paratum malum.

7:8 Qui cum reversus esset de horto nemoribus consito, et intrasset
convivii locum, reperit Aman super lectulum corruisse, in quo
iacebat Esther, et ait: Etiam reginam vult opprimere, me praesente,
in domo mea.  Necdum verbum de ore regis exierat, et statim operuerunt
faciem eius.

7:9 Dixitque Harbona, unus de eunuchis, qui stabant in ministerio regis:
En lignum, quod paraverat Mardochaeo, qui locutus est pro rege,
stat in domo Aman, habens altitudinis quinquaginta cubitos.
Cui dixit rex: Appendite eum in eo.

7:10 Suspensus est itaque Aman in patibulo quod paraverat Mardochaeo:
et regis ira quievit.

8:1 Die illo dedit rex Assuerus Esther reginae domum Aman
adversarii Iudaeorum, et Mardochaeus ingressus est ante faciem regis.
Confessa est enim ei Esther quod esset patruus suus.

8:2 Tulitque rex annulum, quem ab Aman recipi iusserat, et tradidit
Mardochaeo.  Esther autem constituit Mardochaeum super domum suam.



5. EDICTUM EDICTO REPELLITUR, 8:3-17.


8:3 Nec his contenta, procidit ad pedes regis, flevitque et locuta
ad eum oravit ut malitiam Aman Agagitae, et machinationes eius pessimas,
quas excogitaverat contra Iudaeos, iuberet irritas fieri.

8:4 At ille ex more sceptrum aureum protendit manu, quo signum
clementiae monstrabatur: illaque consurgens stetit ante eum,

8:5 et ait: Si placet regi, et si inveni gratiam in oculis eius,
et deprecatio mea non ei videtur esse contraria, obsecro, ut novis
epistolis, veteres Aman litterae, insidiatoris et hostis Iudaeorum,
quibus eos in cunctis regis provinciis perire praeceperat, corrigantur.

8:6 Quo modo enim potero sustinere necem et interfectionem populi mei?

8:7 Responditque rex Assuerus Esther reginae, et Mardochaeo Iudaeo:
Domum Aman concessi Esther, et ipsum iussi affigi cruci, quia ausus
est manum mittere in Iudaeos.

8:8 Scribite ergo Iudaeis, sicut vobis placet, regis nomine,
signantes litteras annulo meo.  Haec enim consuetudo erat,
ut epistolis, quae ex regis nomine mittebantur, et illius annulo
signatae erant, nemo auderet contradicere.

8:9 Accitisque scribis et librariis regis (erat autem tempus tertii
mensis, qui appellatur Siban) vigesima et tertia die illius scriptae
sunt epistolae, ut Mardochaeus voluerat, ad Iudaeos, et ad principes,
procuratoresque et iudices, qui centum vigintiseptem provinciis ab
India usque ad Aethiopiam praesidebant: provinciae atque provinciae,
populo et populo iuxta linguas et litteras suas, et Iudaeis,
prout legere poterant, et audire.

8:10 Ipsaeque epistolae, quae regis nomine mittebantur, annulo ipsius
obsignatae sunt, et missae per veredarios: qui per omnes provincias
discurrentes, veteres litteras novis nunciis praevenirent.

8:11 Quibus imperavit rex, ut convenirent Iudaeos per singulas civitates,
et in unum praeciperent congregari ut starent pro animabus suis,
et omnes inimicos suos cum coniugibus ac liberis et universis domibus,
interficerent atque delerent, et spolia eorum diriperent.

8:12 Et constituta est per omnes provincias una ultionis dies,
id est tertiadecima mensis duodecimi Adar.

8:13 Summaque epistolae haec fuit, ut in omnibus terris ac populis,
qui regis Assueri subiacebant imperio, notum fieret, paratos esse
Iudaeos ad capiendam vindictam de hostibus suis.

8:14 Egressique sunt veredarii celeres nuncia perferentes,
et edictum regis pependit in Susan.

8:15 Mardochaeus autem de palatio, et de conspectu regis egrediens,
fulgebat vestibus regiis, hyacinthinis videlicet et aeriis,
coronam auream portans in capite, et amictus serico pallio atque purpureo.
Omnisque civitas exultavit, atque laetata est.

8:16 Iudaeis autem nova lux oriri visa est, gaudium, honor, et tripudium.

8:17 Apud omnes populos, urbes, atque provincias, quocumque regis
iussa veniebant, mira exultatio, epulae atque convivia, et festus dies:
in tantum ut plures alterius gentis et sectae eorum religioni et ceremoniis
iungerentur.  Grandis enim cunctos Iudaici nominis terror invaserat.



6. IUDAEI AB INIMICIS SE VINDICANT, 9:1-19.


9:1 Igitur duodecimi mensis, quem Adar vocari ante iam diximus,
tertiadecima die, quando cunctis Iudaeis interfectio parabatur,
et hostes eorum inhiabant sanguini, versa vice Iudaei superiores
esse coeperunt, et se de adversariis vindicare.

9:2 Congregatique sunt per singulas civitates, oppida, et loca ut
extenderent manum contra inimicos, et persecutores suos.
Nullusque ausus est resistere, eo quod omnes populos magnitudinis
eorum formido penetrarat.

9:3 Nam et provinciarum indices, et duces, et procuratores,
omnisque dignitas, quae singulis locis ac operibus praeerat,
extollebant Iudaeos timore Mardochaei:

9:4 quem principem esse palatii, et plurimum posse cognoverant:
fama quoque nominis eius crescebat quotidie, et per cunctorum ora volitabat.

9:5 Itaque percusserunt Iudaei inimicos suos plaga magna,
et occiderunt eos, reddentes eis quod sibi paraverant facere:

9:6 in tantum ut etiam in Susan quingentos viros interficerent,
extra decem filios Aman Agagitae hostis Iudaeorum: quorum ista sunt nomina:

9:7 Pharsandatha, et Delphon, et Esphatha,

9:8 et Phoratha, et Adalia, et Aridatha,

9:9 et Phermesta et Arisai, et Aridai, et Iezatha.

9:10 Quos cum occidissent, praedas de substantiis eorum tangere noluerunt.

9:11 Statimque numerus eorum, qui occisi erant in Susan,
ad regem relatus est.

9:12 Qui dixit reginae: In urbe Susan interfecerunt Iudaei
quingentos viros, et alios decem filios Aman: quantam putas eos
exercere caedem in universis provinciis?  Quid ultra postulas,
et quid vis ut fieri iubeam?

9:13 Cui illa respondit: Si regi placet, detur potestas Iudaeis,
ut sicut fecerunt hodie in Susan, sic et cras faciant, et decem
filii Aman in patibulis suspendantur.

9:14 Praecepitque rex ut ita fieret.  Statimque in Susan pependit edictum,
et decem filii Aman suspensi sunt.

9:15 Congregatis Iudaeis quartadecima die mensis Adar, interfecti sunt
in Susan trecenti viri: nec eorum ab illis direpta substantia est.

9:16 Sed et per omnes provincias, quae ditioni regis subiacebant,
pro animabus suis steterunt Iudaei, interfectis hostibus ac
persecutoribus suis: in tantum ut septuagintaquinque millia occisorum
implerentur, et nullus de substantiis eorum quidquam contingeret.

9:17 Dies autem tertiusdecimus mensis Adar primus apud omnes
interfectionis fuit, et quartadecima die caedere desierunt.
Quem constituerunt esse sollemnem, ut in eo omni tempore deinceps
vacarent epulis, gaudio atque conviviis.

9:18 At hi, qui in urbe Susan caedem exercuerant, tertiodecimo
et quartodecimo die eiusdem mensis in caede versati sunt:
quintodecimo autem die percutere desierunt.  Et idcirco eundem diem
constituerunt sollemnem epularum atque laetitiae.

9:19 Hi vero Iudaei, qui in oppidis non muratis ac villis morabantur,
quartumdecimum diem mensis Adar conviviorum et gaudii decreverunt,
ita ut exultent in eo, et mittant sibi mutuo partes epularum et ciborum.



7. CELEBRATIO FESTI PHURIM SANCITUR, 9:20-32.


9:20 Scripsit itaque Mardochaeus omnia haec, et litteris comprehensa
misit ad Iudaeos, qui in omnibus regis provinciis morabantur,
tam in vicino positis, quam procul,

9:21 ut quartamdecimam et quintamdecimam diem mensis Adar pro festis
susciperent, et revertente semper anno sollemni celebrarent honore:

9:22 quia in ipsis diebus se ulti sunt Iudaei de inimicis suis,
et luctus atque tristitia in hilaritatem gaudiumque conversa sunt,
essentque dies isti epularum atque laetitiae, et mitterent sibi
invicem ciborum partes, et pauperibus munuscula largirentur.

9:23 Susceperuntque Iudaei in sollemnem ritum cuncta quae eo tempore
facere coeperant, et quae Mardochaeus litteris facienda mandaverat.

9:24 Aman enim, filius Amadathi stirpis Agag, hostis et adversarius
Iudaeorum, cogitavit contra eos malum, ut occideret illos,
atque deleret: et misit phur, quod nostra lingua vertitur in sortem.

9:25 Et postea ingressa est Esther ad regem, obsecrans ut conatus eius,
litteris regis irriti fierent: et malum, quod contra Iudaeos cogitaverat,
reverteretur in caput eius.  Denique et ipsum et filios eius
affixerunt cruci,

9:26 atque ex illo tempore dies isti appellati sunt phurim, id est sortium:
eo quod phur, id est sors, in urnam missa fuerit.  Et cuncta,
quae gesta sunt, epistolae, id est libri huius volumine continentur:

9:27 quaeque sustinuerunt, et quae deinceps immutata sunt,
susceperunt Iudaei super se et semen suum, et super cunctos,
qui religioni eorum voluerunt copulari, ut nulli liceat duos
hos dies absque sollemnitate transigere: quos scriptura testatur,
et certa expetunt tempora, annis sibi iugiter succedentibus.

9:28 Isti sunt dies, quos nulla umquam delebit oblivio: et per
singulas generationes cunctae in toto orbe provinciae celebrabunt:
nec est ulla civitas, in qua dies phurim, id est sortium, non observentur
a Iudaeis, et ab eorum progenie, quae his ceremoniis obligata est.

9:29 Scripseruntque Esther regina filia Abihail, et Mardochaeus
Iudaeus etiam secundam epistolam, ut omni studio dies ista sollemnis
sanciretur in posterum.

9:30 et miserunt ad omnes Iudaeos, qui in centum viginti septem
provinciis regis Assueri versabantur, ut haberent pacem,
et susciperent veritatem,

9:31 observantes Dies sortium, et suo tempore cum gaudio celebrarent:
sicut constituerant Mardochaeus et Esther, et illi observanda
susceperunt a se, et a semine suo ieiunia, et clamores, et Sortium dies,

9:32 et omnia, quae libri huius, qui vocatur Esther, historia continentur.



8. SUMMA DIGNITAS MARDOCHAEI, 10:1-3.


10:1 Rex vero Assuerus omnem terram, et cunctas maris insulas
fecit tributarias:

10:2 cuius fortitudo et imperium, et dignitas atque sublimitas,
qua exaltavit Mardochaeum, scripta sunt in libris Medorum, atque Persarum:

10:3 et quomodo Mardochaeus Iudaici generis secundus a rege Assuero fuerit:
et magnus apud Iudaeos et acceptabilis plebi fratrum suorum, quaerens
bona populo suo, et loquens ea, quae ad pacem seminis sui pertinerent.

1. FINIS LIBRI, 10:4-11:1 [F:1-11].

QUAE HABENTUR IN HEBRAEO, PLENA FIDE EXPRESSI.  HAEC AUTEM,
QUAE SEQUUNTUR, SCRIPTA REPERI IN EDITIONE VULGATA, QUAE GRAECORUM
LINGUA ET LITTERIS CONTINENTUR: ET INTERIM POST FINEM LIBRI HOC
CAPITULUM FEREBATUR: QUOD IUXTA CONSUETUDINEM NOSTRAM OBELO,
ID EST VERU PRAENOTAVIMUS.


10:4 Dixitque Mardochaeus: A Deo facta sunt ista.

10:5 Recordatus sum somnii, quod videram, haec eadem significantis:
nec eorum quidquam irritum fuit.

10:6 Parvus fons, qui crevit in fluvium, et in lucem, solemque
conversus est, et in aquas plurimas redundavit: Esther est, quam rex
accepit uxorem, et voluit esse reginam.

10:7 Duo autem dracones: ego sum, et Aman.

10:8 Gentes, quae convenerant: hi sunt, qui conati sunt delere
nomen Iudaeorum.

10:9 Gens autem mea: Israel est, quae clamavit ad Dominum, et salvum
fecit Dominus populum suum: liberavitque nos ab omnibus malis,
et fecit signa magna atque portenta inter Gentes:

10:10 et duas sortes esse praecepit, unam Populi Dei, et alteram
cunctarum Gentium.

10:11 Venitque utraque sors in statutum ex illo iam tempore diem
coram Deo universis gentibus:

10:12 et recordatus est Dominus populi sui, ac misertus est hereditatis suae.

10:13 Et observabuntur dies isti in mense Adar quartadecima,
et quintadecima die eiusdem mensis, cum omni studio, et gaudio
in unum coetum populi congregati, in cunctas deinceps generationes
populi Israel.

11:1 Anno quarto regnantibus Ptolemaeo, et Cleopatra, attulerunt
Dosithaeus, qui se Sacerdotem, et Levitici generis ferebat,
et Ptolemaeus filius eius hanc epistolam phurim, quam dixerunt
interpretatum esse Lysimachum Ptolemaei filium in Ierusalem.



2. INITIUM LIBRI, 11:2-12:6a [A:1-17].

HOC QUOQUE PRINCIPIUM ERAT IN EDITIONE VULGATA, QUOD NEC IN HEBRAEO,
NEC APUD ULLUM FERTUR INTERPRETUM.


11:2 Anno secundo, regnante Artaxerxe maximo, prima die mensis Nisan,
vidit somnium Mardochaeus filius Iairi, filii Semei, filii Cis,
de tribu Beniamin:

11:3 homo Iudaeus, qui habitabat in urbe Susis, vir magnus,
et inter primos aulae regiae.

11:4 (b) Erat autem de eo numero captivorum, quos transtulerat
Nabuchodonosor rex Babylonis de Ierusalem cum Ieconia rege Iuda:

11:5 et hoc eius somnium fuit: Apparuerunt voces, et tumultus,
et tonitrua, et terraemotus, et conturbatio super terram:

11:6 et ecce duo dracones magni, paratique contra se in praelium.

11:7 Ad quorum clamorem cunctae concitatae sunt nationes,
ut pugnarent contra gentem iustorum.

11:8 Fuitque dies illa tenebrarum et discriminis, tribulationis
et angustiae, et ingens formido super terram.

11:9 Conturbataque est gens iustorum timentium mala sua,
et praeparata ad mortem.

11:10 Clamaveruntque ad Deum: et illis vociferantibus, fons parvus
crevit in fluvium maximum, et in aquas plurimas redundavit.

11:11 Lux et sol ortus est, et humiles exaltati sunt,
et devoraverunt inclytos.

11:12 Quod cum vidisset Mardochaeus, et surrexisset de strato,
cogitabat quid Deus facere vellet: et fixum habebat in animo,
scire cupiens quid significaret somnium.

12:1 Morabatur (c) autem eo tempore in aula regis cum Bagatha et Thara
eunuchis regis, qui ianitores erant palatii.

12:2 Cumque intellexisset cogitationes eorum, et curas diligentius
pervidisset, didicit quod conarentur in regem Artaxerxem manus mittere,
et nunciavit super eo regi.

12:3 Qui de utroque, habita quaestione, confessos iussit duci ad mortem.

12:4 Rex autem quod gestum erat, scripsit in commentariis:
sed et Mardochaeus rei memoriam litteris tradidit.

12:5 Praecepitque ei rex, ut in aula palatii moraretur,
datis ei pro delatione muneribus.

12:6a Aman vero filius Amadathi bugaeus erat gloriosissimus coram rege,
et voluit nocere Mardochaeo, et populo eius pro duobus eunuchis regis,
qui fuerant interfecti.

HUCUSQUE PROOEMIUM.



3. AD 3:14 SUPPLEMENTUM, 12:6b-13:7 [B:1a-7].

QUAE SEQUUTUR, IN EO LOCO POSITA ERANT, UBI SCRIPTUM EST IN VOLUMINE,
Et diripuerunt bona, vel substantias eorum.  QUAE IN SOLA VULGATA
EDITIONE REPERIMUS.


12:6b Epistolae autem hoc exemplar fuit.

13:1 Rex maximus Artaxerxes ab India usque Aethiopiam centum
vigintiseptem provinciarum principibus, et ducibus, qui eius
imperio subiecti sunt, salutem.

13:2 Cum plurimis gentibus imperarem, et universum orbem meae
ditioni subiugassem, volui nequaquam abuti potentiae magnitudine,
sed clementia et lenitate gubernare subiectos, ut absque ullo terrore
vitam silentio transigentes, optata cunctis mortalibus pace fruerentur.

13:3 Quaerente autem me a consiliariis meis quomodo posset hoc impleri,
unus qui sapientia et fide ceteros praecellebat, et erat post regem
secundus, Aman nomine,

13:4 indicavit mihi in toto orbe terrarum populum esse dispersum,
qui novis uteretur legibus, et contra omnium Gentium consuetudinem
faciens, Regum iussa contemneret, et universarum concordiam nationum
sua dissensione violaret.

13:5 Quod cum didicissemus, videntes unam gentem rebellem adversus
omne hominum genus perversis uti legibus, nostrisque iussionibus contraire,
et turbare subiectarum nobis provinciarum pacem atque concordiam,

13:6 iussimus ut quoscumque Aman, qui omnibus provinciis praepositus est,
et secundus a rege, et quem patris loco colimus, monstraverit,
cum coniugibus ac liberis deleantur ab inimicis suis, nullusque eorum
misereatur, quartadecima die duodecimi mensis Adar anni praesentis:

13:7 ut nefarii homines uno die ad inferos descendentes,
reddant imperio nostro pacem, quam turbaverant.

HUCUSQUE EXEMPLAR EPISTOLAE.



4. AD 4:17 SUPPLEMENTUM, 13:8-14:19 [C:1-30].

QUAE SEQUUNTUR, POST EUM LOCUM SCRIPTA REPERI, UBI LEGITUR,
Pergensque Mardochaeus, fecit omnia, quae ei mandaverat Esther.
NEC TAMEN HABENTUR IN HEBRAICO ET APUD NULLUM PENITUS FERUNTUR INTERPRETUM.


13:8 Mardochaeus autem deprecatus est Dominum, memor omnium operum eius,

13:9 et dixit: Domine Domine rex omnipotens, in ditione enim tua
cuncta sunt posita, et non est qui possit tuae resistere voluntati,
si decreveris salvare Israel.

13:10 Tu fecisti caelum et terram, et quidquid caeli ambitu continetur.

13:11 Dominus omnium es, nec est qui resistat maiestati tuae.

13:12 Cuncta nosti, et scis quia non pro superbia et contumelia, et
aliqua gloriae cupiditate fecerim hoc, ut non adorarem Aman superbissimum,

13:13 (Libenter enim pro salute Israel etiam vestigia pedum eius
deosculari paratus essem,)

13:14 sed timui ne honorem Dei mei transferrem ad hominem,
et ne quemquam adorarem, excepto Deo meo.

13:15 Et nunc Domine rex Deus Abraham miserere populi tui,
quia volunt nos inimici nostri perdere, et hereditatem tuam delere.

13:16 Ne despicias partem tuam, quam redemisti tibi de Aegypto.

13:17 Exaudi deprecationem meam, et propitius esto sorti et funiculo tuo,
et converte luctum nostrum in gaudium, ut viventes laudemus nomen
tuum Domine, et ne claudas ora te canentium.

13:18 Omnis quoque Israel pari mente et obsecratione clamavit
ad Dominum, eo quod eis certa mors impenderet.

14:1 Esther quoque regina confugit ad Dominum, pavens periculum,
quod imminebat.

14:2 Cumque deposuisset vestes regias, fletibus et luctui apta
indumenta suscepit, et pro unguentis variis, cinere et stercore
implevit caput, et corpus suum humiliavit ieiuniis: omniaque loca,
in quibus antea laetari consueverat, crinium laceratione complevit.

14:3 Et deprecabatur Dominum Deum Israel, dicens: Domine mi,
qui rex noster es solus, adiuva me solitariam, et cuius praeter
te nullus est auxiliator alius.

14:4 Periculum meum in manibus meis est.

14:5 Audivi a patre meo (d) quod tu Domine tulisses Israel de
cunctis Gentibus, et patres nostros ex omnibus retro maioribus suis,
ut possideres hereditatem sempiternam, fecistique eis sicut locutus es.

14:6 Peccavimus in conspectu tuo, et idcirco tradidisti nos in
manus inimicorum nostrorum:

14:7 coluimus enim deos eorum.  Iustus es Domine:

14:8 et nunc non eis sufficit, quod durissima nos opprimunt servitute,
sed robur manuum suarum, idolorum potentiae deputantes,

14:9 volunt tua mutare promissa, et delere hereditatem tuam,
et claudere ora laudantium te, atque extinguere gloriam templi
et altaris tui,

14:10 ut aperiant ora Gentium, et laudent idolorum fortitudinem,
et praedicent carnalem regem in sempiternum.

14:11 Ne tradas Domine sceptrum tuum his, qui non sunt, ne rideant
ad ruinam nostram: sed converte consilium eorum super eos, et eum,
qui in nos coepit saevire, disperde.

14:12 Memento Domine, et ostende te nobis in tempore tribulationis nostrae,
et da mihi fiduciam Domine rex deorum, et universae potestatis:

14:13 tribue sermonem compositum in ore meo in conspectu leonis,
et transfer cor illius in odium hostis nostri, ut et ipse pereat,
et ceteri, qui ei consentiunt.

14:14 Nos autem libera manu tua, et adiuva me, nullum aliud
auxilium habentem, nisi te, Domine, qui habes omnium scientiam,

14:15 et nosti quia oderim gloriam iniquorum, et detester cubile
incircumcisorum, et onmis alienigenae.

14:16 Tu scis necessitatem meam, quod abominer signum superbiae et
gloriae meae, quod est super caput meum in diebus ostentationis meae,
et detester illud quasi pannum menstruatae, et non portem in diebus
silentii mei,

14:17 et quod non comederim in mensa Aman, nec mihi placuerit
convivium regis, et non biberim vinum libaminum:

14:18 et numquam laetata sit ancilla tua, ex quo huc translata
sum usque in praesentem diem, nisi in te Domine Deus Abraham.

14:19 Deus fortis super omnes, exaudi vocem eorum, qui nullam aliam
spem habent, et libera nos de manu iniquorum, et erue me a timore meo.



5. AD 4:8 SUPPLEMENTUM, 15:1-3 [B:7.5, B:8, & 4:9a].

HAEC QUOQUE ADDITA REPERI IN EDITIONE VULGATA.


15:1 Et mandavit ei (haud dubium quin esset Mardochaeus) ut
ingrederetur ad regem, et rogaret pro populo suo et pro patria sua.

15:2 Memorare (inquit) dierum humilitatis tuae, quomodo nutrita sis
in manu mea, quia Aman secundus a rege locutus est contra nos in mortem:

15:3 et tu invoca Dominum, et loquere regi pro nobis, et libera nos de morte.



6. AD 5:1 S. SUPPLEMENTUM, 15:4-19 [D:1-16].

NECNON ET ISTA QUAE SUBDITA SUNT.


15:4 Die autem tertio deposuit vestimenta ornatus sui,
et circumdata est gloria sua.

15:5 Cumque regio fulgeret habitu, et invocasset omnium rectorem
et salvatorem Deum, assumpsit duas famulas,

15:6 et super unam quidem innitebatur, quasi prae deliciis et
nimia teneritudine corpus suum ferre non sustinens:

15:7 altera autem famularum sequebatur dominam, defluentia in
humum indumenta sustentans.

15:8 Ipsa autem roseo colore vultum perfusa, et gratis ac nitentibus
oculis tristem celabat animum, et nimio timore contractum.

15:9 Ingressa igitur cuncta per ordinem ostia, stetit contra regem,
ubi ille residebat super solium regni sui, indutus vestibus regiis,
auroque fulgens, et pretiosis lapidibus, eratque terribilis aspectu.

15:10 Cumque elevasset faciem, et ardentibus oculis furorem pectoris
indicasset, regina corruit, et in pallorem colore mutato, lassum super
ancillulam reclinavit caput.

15:11 Convertitque Deus spiritum regis in mansuetudinem, et festinus
ac metuens exilivit de solio, et sustentans eam ulnis suis,
donec rediret ad se, his verbis blandiebatur:

15:12 Quid habes Esther?  Ego sum frater tuus, noli metuere.

15:13 Non morieris: non enim pro te, sed pro omnibus haec lex constituta est.

15:14 Accede igitur, et tange sceptrum.

15:15 Cumque illa reticeret, tulit auream virgam, et posuit super
collum eius, et osculatus est eam, et ait: Cur mihi non loqueris?

15:16 Quae respondit: Vidi te domine quasi Angelum Dei,
et conturbatum est cor meum prae timore gloriae tuae.

15:17 Valde enim mirabilis es domine, et facies tua plena est gratiarum.

15:18 Cumque loqueretur, rursus corruit, et pene exanimata est.

15:19 Rex autem turbabatur, et omnes ministri eius consolabantur eam.



7. AD 8:13 SUPPLEMENTUM, 16:1-24 [E:1-24].

EXEMPLAR EPISTOLAE REGIS ARTAXERXIS, QUAM PRO IUDAEIS AD TOTAS REGNI
SUI PROVINCIAS MISIT: QUOD ET IPSUM IN HEBRAICO VOLUMINE NON HABETUR.


16:1 Rex magnus Artaxerxes (e) ab India usque Aethiopiam centum
vigintiseptem provinciarum ducibus ac principibus, qui nostrae
iussioni obediunt, salutem dicit.

16:2 Multi bonitate principum et honore, qui in eos collatus est,
abusi sunt in superbiam:

16:3 et non solum subiectos regibus nituntur opprimere, sed datam
sibi gloriam non ferentes, in ipsos, qui dederunt, moliuntur insidias.

16:4 Nec contenti sunt gratias non agere beneficiis, et humanitatis
in se iura violare, sed Dei quoque cuncta cernentis arbitrantur se
posse fugere sententiam.

16:5 Et in tantum vesaniae proruperunt, ut eos, qui credita sibi
officia diligenter observant, et ita cuncta agunt ut omnium laude
digni sint, mendaciorum cuniculis conentur subvertere,

16:6 dum aures principum simplices, et ex sua natura alios aestimantes,
callida fraude decipiunt.

16:7 Quae res et ex veteribus probatur historiis, et ex his,
quae geruntur quotidie, quo modo malis quorumdam suggestionibus
regum studia depraventur.

16:8 Unde providendum est paci omnium provinciarum.

16:9 Nec putare debetis, si diversa iubeamus, ex animi nostri
venire levitate, sed pro qualitate et necessitate temporum,
ut reipublicae poscit utilitas, ferre sententiam.

16:10 Et ut manifestius quod dicimus, intelligatis, (f) Aman filius
Amadathi, et animo et gente Macedo, alienusque a Persarum sanguine,
et pietatem nostram sua crudelitate commaculans, peregrinus a nobis
susceptus est:

16:11 et tantam in se expertus humanitatem, ut pater noster vocaretur,
et adoraretur ab omnibus post regem secundus:

16:12 qui in tantum arrogantiae tumorem sublatus est, ut regno
privare nos niteretur et spiritu.

16:13 Nam Mardochaeum, cuius fide et beneficiis vivimus,
et consortem regni nostri Esther cum omni gente sua novis
quibusdam atque inauditis machinis expetivit in mortem:

16:14 hoc cogitans ut illis interfectis, insidiaretur nostrae
solitudini, et regnum Persarum transferret in Macedonas.

16:15 Nos autem a pessimo mortalium Iudaeos neci destinatos,
in nulla penitus culpa reperimus, sed econtrario iustis utentes legibus,

16:16 et filios altissimi et maximi, semperque viventis Dei,
cuius beneficio et patribus nostris et nobis regnum est traditum,
et usque hodie custoditur.

16:17 Unde eas litteras, quas sub nomine nostro ille direxerat,
sciatis esse irritas.

16:18 Pro quo scelere ante portas huius urbis, id est, Susan,
et ipse qui machinatus est, et omnis cognatio eius pendet in patibulis:
non nobis, sed Deo reddente ei quod meruit.

16:19 Hoc autem edictum, quod nunc mittimus, in cunctis
urbibus proponatur, ut liceat Iudaeis uti legibus suis.

16:20 Quibus debetis esse adminiculo, ut eos, qui se ad necem eorum
paraverant, possint interficere tertiadecima die mensis duodecimi,
qui vocatur Adar.

16:21 hanc enim diem, Deus omnipotens, moeroris et luctus,
eis vertit in gaudium.

16:22 Unde et vos inter ceteros festos dies, hanc habetote diem,
et celebrate eam cum omni laetitia, ut et in posterum cognoscatur,

16:23 onmes, qui fideliter Persis obediunt, dignam pro fide recipere
mercedem: qui autem insidiantur regno eorum, perire pro scelere.

16:24 Omnis autem provincia et civitas, quae noluerit sollemnitatis
huius esse particeps, gladio et igne pereat, et sic deleatur,
ut non solum hominibus, sed etiam bestiis invia sit in sempiternum,
pro exemplo contemptus, et inobedientiae.

I have assembled four lists of the designations used for the Bible
books from the above source: Full Tiles, Long Names, Short Names,

in "First Caps" rather than "ALL CAPS" and exploding the ligature
for "ae" into two characters rather than a one character diphthong.
The listing order is as arranged in the source text.

LIFE OF ST. DECLAN OF ARDMORE

(Edited from MS. in Bibliotheque Royale, Brussels).

Translated from the Irish With Introduction

by Rev. P. Power, M.R.I.A.

University College, Cork.




INTRODUCTION


     "If thou hast the right, O Erin,
     to a champion of battle to aid thee
     thou hast the head of a hundred
     thousand, Declan of Ardmore"
     (Martyrology of Oengus).


Five miles or less to the east of Youghal Harbour, on the southern
Irish coast, a short, rocky and rather elevated promontory juts, with a
south-easterly trend, into the ocean [about 51 deg. 57 min. N / 7 deg.
43 min. W]. Maps and admiralty charts call it Ram Head, but the real
name is Ceann-a-Rama and popularly it is often styled Ardmore Head. The
material of this inhospitable coast is a hard metamorphic schist which
bids defiance to time and weather. Landwards the shore curves in clay
cliffs to the north-east, leaving, between it and the iron headland
beyond, a shallow exposed bay wherein many a proud ship has met her
doom. Nestling at the north side of the headland and sheltered by the
latter from Atlantic storms stands one of the most remarkable groups of
ancient ecclesiastical remains in Ireland--all that has survived of St.
Declan's holy city of Ardmore. This embraces a beautiful and perfect
round tower, a singularly interesting ruined church commonly called the
cathedral, the ruins of a second church beside a holy well, a primitive
oratory, a couple of ogham inscribed pillar stones, &c., &c.

No Irish saint perhaps has so strong a local hold as Declan or has left
so abiding a popular memory. Nevertheless his period is one of the great
disputed questions of early Irish history. According to the express
testimony of his Life, corroborated by testimony of the Lives of SS.
Ailbhe and Ciaran, he preceded St. Patrick in the Irish mission and
was a co-temporary of the national apostle. Objection, exception or
opposition to the theory of Declan's early period is based less on any
inherent improbability in the theory itself than on contradictions and
inconsistencies in the Life. Beyond any doubt the Life does actually
contradict itself; it makes Declan a cotemporary of Patrick in the fifth
century and a cotemporary likewise of St. David a century later. In
any attempted solution of the difficulty involved it may be helpful
to remember a special motive likely to animate a tribal histrographer,
scil.:--the family relationship, if we may so call it, of the two
saints; David was bishop of the Deisi colony in Wales as Declan was
bishop of their kinsmen of southern Ireland. It was very probably part
of the writer's purpose to call attention to the links of kindred which
bound the separated Deisi; witness his allusion later to the alleged
visit of Declan to his kinsmen of Bregia. Possibly there were several
Declans, as there were scores of Colmans, Finians, &c., and hence
perhaps the confusion and some of the apparent inconsistencies. There
was certainly a second Declan, a disciple of St. Virgilius, to whom the
latter committed care of a church in Austria where he died towards
close of eighth century. Again we find mention of a St. Declan who was
a foster son of Mogue of Ferns, and so on. It is too much, as Delehaye
("Legendes Hagiographiques") remarks, to expect the populace to
distinguish between namesakes. Great men are so rare! Is it likely there
should have lived two saints of the same name in the same country!

The latest commentators on the question of St. Declan's period--and they
happen to be amongst the most weighty--argue strongly in favour of the
pre-Patrician mission (Cfr. Prof. Kuno Meyer, "Learning Ireland in the
Fifth Century"). Discussing the way in which letters first reached our
distant island of the west and the causes which led to the proficiency
of sixth-century Ireland in classical learning Zimmer and Meyer contend
that the seeds of that literary culture, which flourished in Ireland of
the sixth century, had been sown therein in the first and second decades
of the preceding century by Gaulish scholars who had fled from their own
country owing to invasion of the latter by Goths and other barbarians.
The fact that these scholars, who were mostly Christians, sought asylum
in Ireland indicates that Christianity had already penetrated thither,
or at any rate that it was known and tolerated there. Dr. Meyer answers
the objection that if so large and so important an invasion of scholars
took place we ought have some reference to the fact in the Irish annals.
The annals, he replies, are of local origin and they rarely refer in
their oldest parts to national events: moreover they are very meagre in
their information about the fifth century. One Irish reference to the
Gaulish scholars is, however, adduced in corroboration; it occurs in
that well known passage in St. Patrick's "Confessio" where the saint
cries out against certain "rhetoricians" in Ireland who were hostile
to him and pagan,--"You rhetoricians who do not know the Lord, hear and
search Who it was that called me up, fool though I be, from the midst
of those who think themselves wise and skilled in the law and mighty
orators and powerful in everything." Who were these "rhetorici" that
have made this passage so difficult for commentators and have caused
so various constructions to be put upon it? It is clear, the professor
maintains, that the reference is to pagan rhetors from Gaul whose
arrogant presumption, founded on their learning, made them regard with
disdain the comparatively illiterate apostle of the Scots. Everyone is
familiar with the classic passage of Tacitus wherein he alludes to the
harbours of Ireland as being more familiar to continental mariners than
those of Britain. We have references moreover to refugee Christians who
fled to Ireland from the persecutions of Diocletian more than a century
before St. Patrick's day; in addition it is abundantly evident that
many Irishmen--Christians like Celestius the lieutenant of Pelagius,
and possibly Pelagius himself, amongst them--had risen to distinction or
notoriety abroad before middle of the fifth century.

Possibly the best way to present the question of Declan's age is to put
in tabulated form the arguments of the pre-Patrician advocates against
the counter contentions of those who claim that Declan's period is later
than Patrick's:--


   For the Pre-Patrician Mission.            Against Theory of Early
                                               Fifth Century period.

   I.--Positive statement of Life,      I.--Contradictions, anachronisms,
      corroborated by Lives of SS.         &c., of Life.
      Ciaran and Ailbhe.               II.--Lack of allusion to Declan in
  II.--Patrick's apparent avoidance        the Lives of St. Patrick.
      of the Principality of Decies.  III.--Prosper's testimony to the
 III.--The peculiar Declan cult and        mission of Palladius as first
      the strong local hold which          bishop to the believing Scots.
      Declan has maintained.           IV.--Alleged motives for later
                                           invention of Pre-Patrician story.


In this matter and at this hour it is hardly worth appealing to the
authority of Lanigan and the scholars of the past. Much evidence not
available in Lanigan's day is now at the service of scholars. We are to
look rather at the reasoning of Colgan, Ussher, and Lanigan than to the
mere weight of their names.

Referring in order to our tabulated grounds of argument, pro and con,
and taking the pro arguments first, we may (I.) discard as evidence for
our purpose the Life of St. Ibar which is very fragmentary and otherwise
a rather unsatisfactory document. The Lives of Ailbhe, Ciaran, and
Declan are however mutually corroborative and consistent. The
Roman visit and the alleged tutelage under Hilarius are probably
embellishments; they look like inventions to explain something and they
may contain more than a kernel of truth. At any rate they are matters
requiring further investigation and elucidation. In this connection it
may be useful to recall that the Life (Latin) of St. Ciaran has been
attributed by Colgan to Evinus the disciple and panegyrist of St.
Patrick.

Patrick's apparent neglect of the Decies (II.) may have no special
significance. At best it is but negative evidence: taken, however, in
connection with (I.) and its consectaria it is suggestive. We can
hardly help speculating why the apostle--passing as it were by its
front door--should have given the go-bye to a region so important as the
Munster Decies. Perhaps he sent preachers into it; perhaps there was no
special necessity for a formal mission, as the faith had already
found entrance. It is a little noteworthy too that we do not find St.
Patrick's name surviving in any ecclesiastical connection with the
Decies, if we except Patrick's Well, near Clonmel, and this Well is
within a mile or so of the territorial frontier. Moreover the southern
portion of the present Tipperary County had been ceded by Aengus to the
Deisi, only just previous to Patrick's advent, and had hardly yet had
sufficient time to become absorbed. The whole story of Declan's alleged
relations with Patrick undoubtedly suggests some irregularity in
Declan's mission--an irregularity which was capable of rectification
through Patrick and which de facto was finally so rectified.

(III.) No one in Eastern Munster requires to be told how strong is the
cult of St. Declan throughout Decies and the adjacent territory. It is
hardly too much to say that the Declan tradition in Waterford and Cork
is a spiritual actuality, extraordinary and unique, even in a land
which till recently paid special popular honour to its local saints. In
traditional popular regard Declan in the Decies has ever stood first,
foremost, and pioneer. Carthage, founder of the tribal see, has held and
holds in the imagination of the people only a secondary place. Declan,
whencesoever or whenever he came, is regarded as the spiritual father
to whom the Deisi owe the gift of faith. How far this tradition and the
implied belief in Declan's priority and independent mission are derived
from circulation of the "Life" throughout Munster in the last few
centuries it is difficult to gauge, but the tradition seems to have
flourished as vigorously in the days of Colgan as it does to-day.
Declan's "pattern" at Ardmore continues to be still the most noted
celebration of its kind in Ireland. A few years ago it was participated
in by as many as fourteen thousand people from all parts of Waterford,
Cork, and Tipperary. The scenes and ceremonies have been so frequently
described that it is not necessary to recount them here--suffice it to
say that the devotional practices and, in fact, the whole celebration
is of a purely popular character receiving no approbation, and but bare
toleration, from church or clergy. Even to the present day Declan's name
is borne as their praenomen by hundreds of Waterford men, and, before
introduction of the modern practice of christening with foolish foreign
names, its use was far more common, as the ancient baptismal registers
of Ardmore, Old Parish, and Clashmore attest. On the other hand Declan's
name is associated with comparatively few places in the Decies. Of these
the best known is Relig Deaglain, a disused graveyard and early church
site on the townland of Drumroe, near Cappoquin. There was also an
ancient church called Killdeglain, near Stradbally.

Against the theory of the pre-Patrician or citra-Patrician mission we
have first the objection, which really has no weight, and which we shall
not stop to discuss, that it is impossible for Christianity at that
early date to have found its way to this distant island, beyond the
boundary of the world. An argument on a different plane is (I.), the
undoubtedly contradictory and inconsistent character of the Life. It is
easy however to exaggerate the importance of this point. Modern critical
methods were undreamed of in the days of our hagiographer, who
wrote, moreover, for edification only in a credulous age. Most of the
historical documents of the period are in a greater or less degree
uncritical but that does not discredit their testimony however much it
may confuse their editors. It can be urged moreover that two mutually
incompatible genealogies of the saint are given. The genealogy given by
MacFirbisigh seems in fact to disagree in almost every possible detail
with the genealogy in 23 M. 50 R.I.A. That however is like an argument
that Declan never existed. It really suggests and almost postulates the
existence of a second Declan whose Acts and those of our Declan have
become mutually confused.

(II.) Absence of Declan's name from the Acts of Patrick is a negative
argument. It is explicable perhaps by the supposed irregularity of
Declan's preaching. Declan was certainly earlier than Mochuda and yet
there is no reference to him in the Life of the latter saint. Ailbhe
however is referred to in the Tripartite Life of Patrick and the
cases of Ailbhe and Declan are "a pari"; the two saints stand or fall
together.

(IV.) Motives for invention of the pre-Patrician myth are alleged,
scil.:--to rebut certain claims to jurisdiction, tribute or visitation
advanced by Armagh in after ages. It is hard to see however how
resistance to the claims in question could be better justified on the
theory of a pre-Patrician Declan, who admittedly acknowledged Patrick's
supremacy, than on the admission of a post-Patrician mission.

That in Declan we have to deal with a very early Christian teacher of
the Decies there can be no doubt. If not anterior to Patrick he must
have been the latter's cotemporary. Declan however had failed to convert
the chieftain of his race and for this--reading between the lines of the
"Life"--we seem to hear Patrick blaming him.

The monuments proper of Declan remaining at Ardmore are (a) his ORATORY
near the Cathedral and Round Tower in the graveyard, (b) his STONE on
the beach, (c) his WELL on the cliff, and (d) ANOTHER STONE said to have
been found in his tomb and preserved at Ardmore for long ages with great
reveration. The "Life" refers moreover to the saint's pastoral staff and
his bell but these have disappeared for centuries.

The "Oratory" is simply a primitive church of the usual sixth century
type: it stands 13' 4" x 8' 9" in the clear, and has, or had, the usual
high-pitched gables and square-headed west doorway with inclining jambs.
Another characteristic feature of the early oratory is seen in the
curious antae or prolongation of the side walls. Locally the little
building is known as the "beannacan," in allusion, most likely, to
its high gables or the finials which once, no doubt, in Irish fashion,
adorned its roof. Though somewhat later than Declan's time this
primitive building is very intimately connected with the Saint.
Popularly it is supposed to be his grave and within it is a hollow space
scooped out, wherein it is said his ashes once reposed. It is highly
probable that tradition is quite correct as to the saint's grave, over
which the little church was erected in the century following Declan's
death. The oratory was furnished with a roof of slate by Bishop Mills in
1716.

"St. Declan's Stone" is a glacial boulder of very hard conglomerate
which lies on a rocky ledge of beach beneath the village of Ardmore.
It measures some 8' 6" x 4' 6" x 4' 0" and reposes upon two slightly
jutting points of the underlying metamorphic rock. Wonderful virtues are
attributed to St. Declan's Stone, which, on the occasion of the patronal
feast, is visited by hundreds of devotees who, to participate in its
healing efficacy and beneficence, crawl laboriously on face and hands
through the narrow space between the boulder and the underlying rock.
Near by, at foot of a new storm-wall, are two similar but somewhat
smaller boulders which, like their venerated and more famous neighbour,
were all wrenched originally by a glacier from their home in the
Comeragh Mountains twenty miles away.

"St. Declan's Well," beside some remains of a rather large and
apparently twelfth century church on the cliff, in the townland of
Dysert is diverted into a shallow basin in which pilgrims bathe feet
and hands. Set in some comparatively modern masonry over the well are
a carved crucifixion and other figures of apparently late mediaeval
character. Some malicious interference with this well led, nearly a
hundred years since, to much popular indignation and excitement.

The second "St. Declan's Stone" was a small, cross-inscribed jet-black
piece of slate or marble, approximately--2" or 3" x 1 1/2". Formerly
it seems to have had a small silver cross inset and was in great demand
locally as an amulet for cattle curing. It disappeared however, some
fifty years or so since, but very probably it could still be recovered
in Dungarvan.

Far the most striking of all the monuments at Ardmore is, of course, the
Round Tower which, in an excellent state of preservation, stands with
its conical cap of stone nearly a hundred feet high. Two remarkable, if
not unique, features of the tower are the series of sculptured corbels
which project between the floors on the inside, and the four projecting
belts or zones of masonry which divide the tower into storeys
externally. The tower's architectural anomalies are paralleled by its
history which is correspondingly unique: it stood a regular siege in
1642, when ordnance was brought to bear on it and it was defended
by forty confederates against the English under Lords Dungarvan and
Broghil.

A few yards to north of the Round Tower stands "The Cathedral"
illustrating almost every phase of ecclesiastical architecture which
flourished in Ireland from St. Patrick to the Reformation--Cyclopean,
Celtic-Romanesque, Transitional and Pointed. The chancel arch is
possibly the most remarkable and beautiful illustration of the
Transitional that we have. An extraordinary feature of the church is
the wonderful series of Celtic arcades and panels filled with archaic
sculptures in relief which occupy the whole external face of the west
gable.

St. Declan's foundation at Ardmore seems (teste Moran's Archdall) to
have been one of the Irish religious houses which accepted the reform of
Pope Innocent at the Lateran Council and to have transformed itself
into a Regular Canonry. It would however be possible to hold, on the
evidence, that it degenerated into a mere parochial church. We hear
indeed of two or three episcopal successors of the saint, scil.:--Ultan
who immediately followed him, Eugene who witnessed a charter to the
abbey of Cork in 1174, and Moelettrim O Duibhe-rathre who died in
1303 after he had, according to the annals of Inisfallen, "erected and
finished the Church" of Ardmore. The "Wars of the Gaedhil and Gall"
have reference, circa 824 or 825, to plunder by the Northmen of Disert
Tipraite which is almost certainly the church of Dysert by the Holy Well
at Ardmore. The same fleet, on the same expedition, plundered Dunderrow
(near Kinsale), Inisshannon (Bandon River), Lismore, and Kilmolash.

Regarding the age of our "Life" it is difficult with the data at hand
to say anything very definite. While dogmatism however is dangerous
indefiniteness is unsatisfying. True, we cannot trace the genealogy
of the present version beyond middle of the sixteenth century, but its
references to ancient monuments existing at date of its compilation show
it to be many centuries older. Its language proves little or nothing,
for, being a popular work, it would be modernised to date by each
successive scribe. Colgan was of opinion it was a composition of the
eighth century. Ussher and Ware, who had the Life in very ancient
codices, also thought it of great antiquity. Papebrach, the Bollandist,
on the other hand, considered the Life could not be older than the
twelfth century, but this opinion of his seems to have been based on a
misapprehension. In the absence of all diocesan colour or allusion one
feels constrained to assign the production to some period previous to
Rathbreasail. We should not perhaps be far wrong in assigning the first
collection of materials to somewhere in the eighth century or in the
century succeeding. The very vigorous ecclesiastical revival of the
eleventh century, at conclusion of the Danish wars, must have led to
some revision of the country's religious literature. The introduction,
a century and-a-half later, of the great religious orders most probably
led to translation of the Life into Latin and its casting into shape for
reading in refectory or choir.

Only three surviving copies of the Irish Life are known to the writer:
one in the Royal Library at Brussels, the second in the Royal Irish
Academy Collection (M. 23, 50, pp. 109-120), and the third in possession
of Professor Hyde. As the second and third enumerated are copies of one
imperfect exemplar it has not been thought necessary to collate both
with the Brussels MS. which has furnished the text here printed. M. 23,
50 (R.I.A.) has however been so collated and the marginal references
initialled B are to that imperfect copy. The latter, by the way, is in
the handwriting of John Murphy "na Raheenach," and is dated 1740. It has
not been thought necessary to give more than the important variants.

The present text is a reproduction of the Brussels MS. plus lengthening
of contractions. As regards lengthening in question it is to be noted
that the well known contraction for "ea" or "e" has been uniformly
transliterated "e." Otherwise orthography of the MS. has been
scrupulously followed--even where inconsistent or incorrect. For the
division into paragraphs the editor is not responsible; he has merely
followed the division originated, or adopted, by the scribe. The Life
herewith presented was copied in 1629 by Brother Michael O'Clery of the
Four Masters' staff from an older MS. of Eochy O'Heffernan's dated 1582.
The MS. of O'Heffernan is referred to by our scribe as "seinleabar,"
but his reference is rather to the contents than to the copy. Apparently
O'Clery did more than transcribe; he re-edited, as was his wont, into
the literary Irish of his day. A page of the Brussels MS., reproduced in
facsimile as a frontispiece to the present volume, will give the student
a good idea of O'Clery's script and style.

Occasional notes on Declan in the martyrologies and elsewhere give some
further information about our saint. Unfortunately however the alleged
facts are not always capable of reconciliation with statements of our
"Life," and again the existence of a second, otherwise unknown, Declan
is suggested. The introduction of rye is attributed to him in the
Calendar of Oengus, as introduction of wheat is credited to St. Finan
Camm, and introduction of bees to St. Modomnoc,--"It was the full of his
shoe that Declan brought, the full of his shoe likewise Finan, but the
full of his bell Modomnoc" (Cal. Oeng., April 7th). More puzzling is the
note in the same Calendar which makes Declan a foster son of Mogue
of Ferns! This entry illustrates the way in which errors originate. A
former scribe inadvertently copied in, after Declan's name, portion of
the entry immediately following which relates to Colman Hua Liathain.
Successive scribes re-copied the error without discovering it and so it
became stereotyped.




LIFE OF ST. DECLAN

or "BETHA DECCLAIN"


1. The most blessed Bishop Declan of the most noble race of the kings
of Ireland, i.e., the holy bishop who is called Declan was of the most
noble royal family of Ireland--a family which held the sceptre and
exacted tribute from all Ireland at Tara for ages. Declan was by birth
of noble blood as will appear from his origin and genealogy, for it was
from Eochaidh Feidhleach, the powerful Ardrigh of Ireland for
twelve years, that he sprang. Eochaidh aforesaid, had three sons,
scil.:--Breas, Nar, and Lothola, who are called the three Finneavna;
there reigned one hundred and seven kings of their race and
kindred before and after them, i.e. of the race of Eremon, king of
Ireland,--before the introduction of Christianity and since. These three
youths lay one day with their own sister Clothra, daughter of the
same father, and she conceived of them. The son she brought forth as a
consequence of that intercourse was marked by three red wavy lines which
indicated his descent from the three youths aforesaid. He was named
Lugaidh Sriabhdearg from the three lines [sriabaib] in question, and he
was beautiful to behold and of greater bodily strength in infancy than
is usual with children of his age. He commenced his reign as king of
Ireland the year in which Caius Caesar [Caligula] died and he reigned
for twenty-six years. His son was named Criomthan Nianair who reigned
but sixteen years. Criomthan's son was named Fearadach Finnfechtnach
whose son was Fiacha Finnolaidh whose son again was Tuathal Teachtmhar.
This Tuathal had a son Felimidh Reachtmhar who had in turn three
sons--Conn Ceadcathach, Eochaidh Finn, and Fiacha Suighde. Conn was king
of Ireland for twenty years and the productiveness of crops and soil and
of dairies in the time of Conn are worthy of commemoration and of fame
to the end of time. Conn was killed in Magh Cobha by the Ulstermen,
scil.:--by Tiopruid Tireach and it is principally his seed which has
held the kingship of Ireland ever since. Eochaidh Finn was second son
to Felimidh Reachtmhar and he migrated to the latter's province of
Leinster, and it is in that province his race and progeny have remained
since then. They are called Leinstermen, and there are many chieftains
and powerful persons of them in Leinster. Fiacha Suighde moreover,
although he died before he succeeded to the chief sovereignty, possessed
land around Tara. He left three sons--Ross, Oengus, and Eoghan who
were renowned for martial deeds--valiant and heroic in battle and in
conflict. Of the three, Oengus excelled in all gallant deeds so that he
came to be styled Oengus of the poisonous javelin. Cormac Mac Art Mac
Conn it was who reigned in Ireland at this time. Cormac had a son named
Ceallach who took by force the daughter of Eoghan Mac Fiacha Suighde
to dwell with him, i.e. Credhe the daughter of Eoghan. When Oengus
Gaebuaibhtheach ("of the poisonous javelin") heard this, viz., that the
daughter of his brother had been abducted by Ceallach he was roused to
fury and he followed Ceallach to Tara taking with him his foster child,
scil.:--Corc Duibhne, the son of Cairbre, son of Conaire, son of Mogha
Lamha whom Cormac held as a hostage from the Munstermen, and whom he
had given for safe custody to Oengus. When Oengus reached Tara he beheld
Ceallach sitting behind Cormac. He thrust his spear at Ceallach and
pierced him through from front to back. However as he was withdrawing
the spear the handle struck Cormac's eye and knocked it out and then,
striking the steward, killed him. He himself (Oengus) with his foster
child escaped safely. After a time Cormac, grieving for the loss of his
son, his eye and his steward at the hands of Oengus of the poisonous
javelin and of his kinsmen, ordered their expulsion from their tribal
territory, i.e. from the Decies of Tara, and not alone from these, but
from whole northern half of Ireland. However, seven battles were fought
in which tremendous loss was inflicted on Cormac and his followers
before Oengus and his people, i.e. the three sons of Fiacha Suighde,
namely, Ross and Oengus and Eoghan, as we have already said, were
eventually defeated, and obliged to fly the country and to suffer exile.
Consequent on their banishment as above by the king of Ireland they
sought hospitality from the king of Munster, Oilill Olum, because
Sadhbh, daughter of Conn Ceadcathach was his wife. They got land from
him, scil.: the Decies of Munster, and it is to that race, i.e. the race
of Eoghan Mac Fiacha Suighde that the kings and country of the Decies
belong ever since.

2. Of this same race of Eoghan was the holy bishop Declan of whom
I shall speak later scil.: Declan son of Eirc, son of Trein, son of
Lughaidh, son of Miaich, son of Brian, son of Eoghan, son of Art
Corp, son of Moscorb, son of Mesgeadra, son of Measfore, son of Cuana
Cainbhreathaigh, son of Conaire Cathbuadhaigh, son of Cairbre, son
of Eoghan, son of Fiacha Suighde, son of Felimidh Reachtmhar, son of
Tuathal Teachtmhar. The father of Declan was therefore Erc Mac Trein. He
and his wife Deithin went on a visit to the house of his kinsman Dobhran
about the time that Declan's birth was due. The child she bore was
Declan, whom she brought forth without sickness, pain or difficulty but
in being lifted up afterwards he struck his head against a great stone.
Let it be mentioned that Declan showed proofs of sanctification
and power of miracle-working in his mother's womb, as the prophet
writes:--"De vulva sanctificavi te et prophetam in gentibus dedi te"
[Jeremias 1:5] (Before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified
thee and made thee a prophet unto the nations). Thus it is that Declan
was sanctified in his mother's womb and was given by God as a prophet to
the pagans for the conversion of multitudes of them from heathenism
and the misery of unbelief to the worship of Christ and to the Catholic
faith, as we shall see later on. The very soft apex of his head struck
against a hard stone, as we have said, and where the head came in
contact with the stone it made therein a hollow and cavity of its
own form and shape, without injury of any kind to him. Great wonder
thereupon seized all who witnessed this, for Ireland was at this time
without the true faith and it was rarely that any one (therein) had
shown heavenly Christian signs. "Declan's Rock" is the name of the stone
with which the Saint's head came into contact. The water or rain which
falls into the before-mentioned cavity (the place of Declan's head)
dispels sickness and infirmity, by the grace of God, as proof of
Declan's sanctity.

3. On the night of Declan's birth a wondrous sign was revealed to all,
that is to the people who were in the neighbourhood of the birthplace;
this was a ball of fire which was seen blazing on summit of the house in
which the child lay, until it reached up to heaven and down again, and
it was surrounded by a multitude of angels. It assumed the shape of a
ladder such as the Patriarch, Jacob saw [Genesis 28:12]. The persons who
saw and heard these things wondered at them. They did not know (for the
true faith had not yet been preached to them or in this region) that it
was God who (thus) manifested His wondrous power (works) in the infant,
His chosen child. Upon the foregoing manifestation a certain true
Christian, scil.:--Colman, at that time a priest and afterwards a holy
bishop, came, rejoicing greatly and filled with the spirit of prophecy,
to the place where Declan was; he preached the faith of Christ to the
parents and made known to them that the child was full of the grace
of God. He moreover revealed to them the height of glory and honour to
which the infant should attain before God and men, and it was revealed
to him that he (Declan) should spend his life in sanctity and devotion.
Through the grace of God, these, i.e. Erc and Deithin, believed in
God and Colman, and they delivered the child for baptism to Colman who
baptised him thereupon, giving him the name of Declan. When, in the
presence of all, he had administered Baptism, Colman spoke this prophecy
concerning the infant "Truly, beloved child and lord you will be in
heaven and on earth most high and holy, and your good deeds, fame,
and sanctity will fill all (the four quarters of) Ireland and you will
convert your own nation and the Decies from paganism to Christianity.
On that account I bind myself to you by the tie of brotherhood and I
commend myself to your sanctity."

4. Colman thereupon returned to his own abode; he commanded that Declan
should be brought up with due care, that he should be well trained, and
be set to study at the age of seven years if there could be found in his
neighbourhood a competent Christian scholar to undertake his tuition.
Even at the period of his baptism grace and surpassing charity
manifested themselves in the countenance of Declan so that it was
understood of all that great should be the goodness and the spiritual
charm of his mature age. When Dobhran had heard and seen these things
concerning his kinsman Erc he requested the latter and Deithin to give
him the child to foster, and with this request Erc complied. The name of
the locality was "Dobhran's Place" at that time, but since then it has
been "Declan's Place." Dobhran presented the homestead to Declan and
removed his own dwelling thence to another place. In after years, when
Declan had become a bishop, he erected there a celebrated cell in honour
of God, and this is the situation of the cell in question:--In the
southern part of the Decies, on the east side of Magh Sgiath and not
far from the city of Mochuda i.e. Lismore. For the space of seven years
Declan was fostered with great care by Dobhran (his father's brother)
and was much loved by him. God wrought many striking miracles through
Declan's instrumentality during those years. By aid of the Holy Spirit
dwelling in him he (Declan)--discreet Christian man that he was--avoided
every fault and every unlawful desire during that time.

5. On the completion of seven years Declan was taken from his parents
and friends and fosterers to be sent to study as Colman had ordained. It
was to Dioma they sent him, a certain devout man perfect in the faith,
who had come at that time by God's design into Ireland having spent a
long period abroad in acquiring learning. He (Dioma) built in that place
a small cell wherein he might instruct Declan and dwell himself. There
was given him also, to instruct, together with Declan, another child,
scil., Cairbre Mac Colmain, who became afterwards a holy learned
bishop. Both these were for a considerable period pursuing their studies
together.

6. There were seven men dwelling in Magh Sgiath, who frequently saw the
fiery globe which it has been already told they first beheld at the time
of Declan's birth. It happened by the Grace of God that they were the
first persons to reveal and describe that lightning. These seven came to
the place where Declan abode and took him for their director and master.
They made known publicly in the presence of all that, later on, he
should be a bishop and they spoke prophetically:--"The day, O beloved
child and servant of God, will come when we shall commit ourselves and
our lands to thee." And it fell out thus (as they foretold), for, upon
believing, they were baptised and became wise, devout (and) attentive
and erected seven churches in honour of God around Magh Sgiath.

7. Declan remained a long time with Dioma, the holy man we have
named, and acquired science and sanctity and diversity of learning and
doctrine, and he was prudent, mild, and capable so that many who knew
his nobility of blood came when they had heard of the fullness of
his sanctity and grace. Moreover they submitted themselves to him and
accepted his religious rule. Declan judged it proper that he should
visit Rome to study discipline and ecclesiastical system, to secure for
himself esteem and approbation thence, and obtain authority to preach to
the (Irish) people and to bring back with him the rules of Rome as these
obtained in Rome itself. He set out with his followers and he tarried
not till he arrived in Rome where they remained some time.

8. At the same period there was a holy bishop, i.e. Ailbe, who had been
in Rome for a number of years before this and was in the household of
Pope Hilary by whom he had been made a bishop. When Declan with his
disciples arrived in Rome Ailbe received him with great affection and
gladness and he bore testimony before the Roman people to his (Declan's)
sanctity of life and nobility of blood. He (Declan) therefore received
marks of honour and sincere affection from the people and clergy of Rome
when they came to understand how worthy he was, for he was comely, of
good appearance, humble in act, sweet in speech, prudent in counsel,
frank in conversation, virtuous in mien, generous in gifts, holy in life
and resplendent in miracles.

9. When Declan had spent a considerable time in Rome he was ordained a
bishop by the Pope, who gave him church-books and rules and orders and
sent him to Ireland that he might preach there. Having bidden farewell
to the Pope and received the latter's blessing Declan commenced his
journey to Ireland. Many Romans followed him to Ireland to perform their
pilgrimage and to spend their lives there under the yoke and rule of
Bishop Declan, and amongst those who accompanied him was Runan, son of
the king of Rome; he was dear to Declan.

10. On the road through Italy Bishop Declan and Patrick met. Patrick was
not a bishop at that time, though he was (made a bishop) subsequently by
Pope Celestinus, who sent him to preach to the Irish. Patrick was truly
chief bishop of the Irish island. They bade farewell to one another and
they made a league and bond of mutual fraternity and kissed in token of
peace. They departed thereupon each on his own journey, scil.:--Declan
to Ireland and Patrick to Rome.

11. Declan was beginning mass one day in a church which lay in his road,
when there was sent him from heaven a little black bell, (which came)
in through the window of the church and remained on the altar before
Declan. Declan greatly rejoiced thereat and gave thanks and glory to
Christ on account of it, and it filled him with much courage to combat
the error and false teaching of heathendom. He gave the bell for safe
keeping and carriage, to Runan aforesaid, i.e. son of the king of Rome,
and this is its name in Ireland--"The Duibhin Declain," and it is from
its colour it derives its name, for its colour is black [dub]. There
were manifested, by grace of God and Declan's merits, many miracles
through its agency and it is still preserved in Declan's church.

12. When Declan and his holy companions arrived at the Sea of Icht
[English Channel] he failed, owing to lack of money, to find a ship, for
he did not have the amount demanded, and every ship was refused him on
that account. He therefore struck his bell and prayed to God for help in
this extremity. In a short time after this they saw coming towards them
on the crest of the waves an empty, sailless ship and no man therein.
Thereupon Declan said:--"Let us enter the ship in the name of Christ,
and He who has sent it to us will direct it skilfully to what harbour
soever He wishes we should go." At the word of Declan they entered in,
and the ship floated tranquilly and safely until it reached harbour
in England. Upon its abandonment by Declan and his disciples the ship
turned back and went again to the place from which it had come and the
people who saw the miracles and heard of them magnified the name of
the Lord and Declan, and the words of the prophet David were
verified:--"Mirabilis Deus in Sanctis Suis [Psalm 67(68):36] (God is
wonderful in His Saints)."

13. After this Declan came to Ireland. Declan was wise like a serpent
and gentle like a dove and industrious like the bee, for as the bee
gathers honey and avoids the poisonous herbs so did Declan, for he
gathered the sweet sap of grace and Holy Scripture till he was filled
therewith. There were in Ireland before Patrick came thither four holy
bishops with their followers who evangelized and sowed the word of God
there; these are the four:--Ailbe, Bishop Ibar, Declan, and Ciaran.
They drew multitudes from error to the faith of Christ, although it was
Patrick who sowed the faith throughout Ireland and it is he who turned
chiefs and kings of Ireland to the way of baptism, faith and sacrifice
and everlasting judgment.

14. These three, scil.:--Declan, Ailbe and Bishop Ibar made a bond of
friendship and a league amongst themselves and their spiritual posterity
in heaven and on earth for ever and they loved one another. SS. Ailbe
and Declan, especially, loved one another as if they were brothers
so that, on account of their mutual affection they did not like to be
separated from one another--except when their followers threatened to
separate them by force if they did not go apart for a very short
time. After this Declan returned to his own country--to the Decies of
Munster--where he preached, and baptized, in the name of Christ, many
whom he turned to the Catholic faith from the power of the devil. He
built numerous churches in which he placed many of his own followers to
serve and worship God and to draw people to God from the wiles of Satan.

15. Once on a time Declan came on a visit to the place of his birth,
where he remained forty days there and established a religious house in
which devout men have dwelt ever since. Then came the seven men we have
already mentioned as having made their abode around Magh Sgiath and as
having prophesied concerning Declan. They now dedicated themselves and
their establishment to him as they had promised and these are their
names:--Mocellac and Riadan, Colman, Lactain, Finnlaoc, Kevin, &c.
[Mobi]. These therefore were under the rule and spiritual sway of bishop
Declan thenceforward, and they spent their lives devoutly there and
wrought many wonders afterwards.

16. After some time Declan set out to visit Aongus MacNatfrich, king
of Cashel, to preach to him and to convert him to the faith of Christ.
Declan however had two uterine brothers, sons of Aongus, scil.: Colman
and Eoghan. The grace of the Holy Ghost inspiring him Colman went
to Ailbe of Emly and received baptism and the religious habit at the
latter's hands, and he remained for a space sedulously studying science
until he became a saintly and perfect man. Eochaid however remained
as he was (at home)--expecting the kingdom of Munster on his father's
death, and he besought his father to show due honour to his brother
Declan. The king did so and put no obstacle in the way of Declan's
preaching but was pleased with Declan's religion and doctrine, although
he neither believed nor accepted baptism himself. It is said that
refusal (of baptism) was based on this ground: Declan was of the Decies
and of Conn's Half, while Aongus himself was of the Eoghanacht of Cashel
of Munster--always hostile to the Desii. It was not therefore through
ill will to the faith that he believed not, as is proved from this that,
when the king heard of the coming to him of Patrick, the archbishop of
Ireland, a man who was of British race against which the Irish cherished
no hate, not only did he believe but he went from his own city of Cashel
to meet him, professed Christianity and was immediately baptised.

17. After this Declan, having sown the word of God and preached to the
king (although the latter did not assent to his doctrines), proceeded
to his own country and they (the Desii) believed and received baptism
except the king alone and the people of his household who were every day
promising to believe and be baptised. It however came about through the
Devil's agency that they hesitated continually and procrastinated.

18. Other authorities declare that Declan went many times to Rome, but
we have no written testimony from the ancient biographers that he went
there more than three times. On one of these occasions Declan paid a
visit to the holy bishop of the Britons whose name was David at the
church which is called Killmuine [Menevia] where the bishop dwelt beside
the shore of the sea which divides Ireland from Britain. The bishop
received Declan with honour and he remained there forty days, in
affection and joy, and they sang Mass each day and they entered into a
bond of charity which continued between themselves and their successors
for ever afterwards. On the expiration of the forty days Declan took
leave of David giving him a kiss in token of peace and set out himself
and his followers to the shore of the sea to take ship for Ireland.

19. Now the bell which we have alluded to as sent from heaven to Declan,
was, at that time, in the custody of Runan to carry as we have said, for
Declan did not wish, on any account, to part with it. On this particular
day as they were proceeding towards the ship Runan entrusted it to
another member of the company. On reaching the shore however the latter
laid the bell on a rock by the shore and forgot it till they were half
way across the sea. Then they remembered it and on remembrance they were
much distressed. Declan was very sorrowful that the gift sent him by the
Lord from heaven should have been forgotten in a place where he never
expected to find it again. Thereupon raising his eyes heavenward he
prayed to God within his heart and he said to his followers:--"Lay
aside your sorrow for it is possible with God who sent that bell in the
beginning to send it now again by some marvellous ship." Very fully and
wonderfully and beautifully the creature without reason or understanding
obeyed its creator, for the very heavy unwieldy rock floated buoyantly
and without deviation, so that in a short time they beheld it in their
rear with the bell upon it. And when his people saw this wondrous thing
it filled them with love for God and reverence for their master. Declan
thereupon addressed them prophetically:--"Permit the bell to precede
you and follow it exactly and whatsoever haven it will enter into it is
there my city and my bishopric will be whence I shall go to paradise and
there my resurrection will be." Meantime the bell preceded the ship, and
it eased down its great speed remaining slightly in advance of the ship,
so that it could be seen from and not overtaken by the latter. The bell
directed its course to Ireland until it reached a harbour on the south
coast, scil.:--in the Decies of Munster, at an island called, at that
time, High Sheep Island [Aird na gCcaorac] and the ship made the same
port, as Declan declared. The holy man went ashore and gave thanks and
praise to God that he had reached the place of his resurrection. Now, in
that island depastured the sheep belonging to the wife of the
chieftain of Decies and it is thence that it derives its Irish
name--Ard-na-Ccaorac, scil.:--there was in it a high hill and it was a
promontory beautiful to behold. One of the party, ascending the summit
of the hill, said to Declan:--"How can this little height support your
people?" Declan replied:--"Do not call it little hill, beloved son, but
'great height' [ard mor]," and that name has adhered to the city ever
since, scil.:--Ardmore-Declain. After this Declan went to the king of
the Desii and asked of him the aforesaid island. Whereupon the king gave
it to him.

20. Declan next returned to Ait-mBreasail where, in a haven at the north
side, were the shipping and boats of the island, plying thither and
backwards. The people of the island hid all their boats not willing that
Declan should settle there; they dreaded greatly that if Declan came to
dwell there they themselves should be expelled. Whereupon his disciples
addressed Declan:--"Father," said they, "Many things are required
(scil.: from the mainland) and we must often go by boat to this island
and there will be (crossing) more frequently when you have gone to
heaven and we pray thee to abandon the place or else to obtain from God
that the sea recede from the land so that it can be entered dry shod,
for Christ has said:--'Whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my
name He will give it to you' [John 15:16]; the place cannot be easily
inhabited unless the sea recede from it and on that account you cannot
establish your city in it." Declan answered them and said:--"How can I
abandon the place ordained by God and in which He has promised that my
burial and resurrection shall be? As to the alleged inconvenience of
dwelling therein, do you wish me to pray to God (for things) contrary
to His will--to deprive the sea of its natural domain? Nevertheless in
compliance with your request I shall pray to God and whatever thing be
God's will, let it be done." Declan's community thereupon rose up and
said:--"Father, take your crosier as Moses took the rod [Exodus 14:16]
and strike the sea therewith and God will thus show His will to you."
His disciples prayed therefore to him because they were tried and holy
men. They put Declan's crosier in his hand and he struck the water in
the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost and made
the sign of the cross over the water and immediately, by command and
permission of God, the sea commenced to move out from its accustomed
place--so swiftly too that the monsters of the sea were swimming and
running and that it was with difficulty they escaped with the sea.
However, many fishes were left behind on the dry strand owing to the
suddenness of the ebb. Declan, his crosier in his hand, pursued the
receding tide and his disciples followed after him. Moreover the sea
and the departing monsters made much din and commotion and when Declan
arrived at the place where is now the margin of the sea a stripling
whose name was Mainchin, frightened at the thunder of the waves and the
cry of the unknown monsters with gaping mouths following the (receding)
water, exclaimed:--"Father, you have driven out the sea far enough; for
I am afraid of those horrid monsters." When Declan heard this and (saw)
the sea standing still at the word of the youth it displeased him and
turning round he struck him a slight blow on the nose. Three drops of
blood flowed from the wound on to the ground in three separate places
at the feet of Declan. Thereupon Declan blessed the nose and the blood
ceased immediately (to flow). Then Declan declared:--"It was not I who
drove out the sea but God in His own great power who expelled it and He
would have done still more had you not spoken the words you have said."
Three little wells of clear sweet water burst forth in the place where
fell the three drops of blood at the feet of Declan, and these wells are
there still and the colour of blood is seen in them occasionally as a
memorial of this miracle. The shore, rescued from the sea, is a mile
in width and is of great length around (the island) and it is good and
fertile land for tillage and pasture--lying beneath the monastery of
Declan. As to the crosier which was in Declan's hand while he wrought
this miracle, this is its name--the Feartach Declain, from the
miracles and marvels [fertaib] wrought through it. I shall in another,
subsequent, place relate some of these miracles (narrated).

21. After the expulsion of the sea by this famous Saint, scil.: Declan,
whose name and renown spread throughout Erin because of his great and
diverse miracles, he commenced to build a great monastery by the south
side of the stream which flows through the island into the sea. This
monastery is illustrious and beautiful and its name is Ardmor Declain,
as we have said. After this came many persons to Declan, drawn from the
uttermost parts of Ireland, by the fame of his holy living; they devoted
themselves, soul and body to God and Declan, binding themselves
beneath his yoke and his rule. Moreover he built himself in every place
throughout the territory of the Decies, churches and monasteries and
not alone in his own territory (did he build) but in other regions of
Ireland under tribute to him. Great too were the multitudes (thousands)
of men and women who were under his spiritual sway and rule, in the
places we have referred to, throughout Ireland, where happily they
passed their lives. He ordained some of his disciples bishops and
appointed them in these places to sow the seed of faith and religion
therein. Gentleness and charity manifested themselves in Declan to
such an extent that his disciples preferred to live under his immediate
control and under his direction as subjects than to be in authority in
another monastery.

22. After this the holy renowned bishop, head of justice and faith in
the Gaelic island came into Ireland, i.e. Patrick sent by Celestinus,
the Pope. Aongus Mac Nathfrich went to meet him soon as he heard the
account of his coming. He conducted him (Patrick) with reverence and
great honour to his own royal city--to Cashel. Then Patrick baptised him
and blessed himself and his people and his city. Patrick heard that the
prince of the Decies had not been baptised and did not believe, that
there was a disagreement between the prince and Declan and that the
former refused to receive instruction from the latter. Patrick thereupon
set out to preach to the prince aforesaid. Next, as to the four bishops
we have named who had been in Rome: Except Declan alone they were not
in perfect agreement with Patrick. It is true that subsequently to
this they did enter into a league of peace and harmonious actions with
Patrick and paid him fealty. Ciaran, however, paid him all respect and
reverence and was of one mind with him present or absent. Ailbe then,
when he saw the kings and rulers of Ireland paying homage to Patrick
and going out to meet him, came himself to Cashel, to wait on him and he
also paid homage to him (Patrick) and submitted to his jurisdiction, in
presence of the king and all others. Bear in mind it was Ailbe whom the
other holy bishops had elected their superior. He therefore came first
to Patrick, lest the others, on his account, should offer opposition to
Patrick, and also that by his example the others might be more easily
drawn to his jurisdiction and rule. Bishop Ibar however would on no
account consent to be subject to Patrick, for it was displeasing to him
that a foreigner should be patron of Ireland. It happened that Patrick
in his origin was of the Britons and he was nurtured in Ireland having
been sold to bondage in his boyhood. There arose misunderstanding
and dissension between Patrick and Bishop Ibar at first, although
(eventually), by intervention of the angel of peace, they formed a
mutual fellowship and brotherly compact and they remained in agreement
for ever after. But Declan did not wish to disagree at all with Patrick
for they had formed a mutual bond of friendship on the Italian highway
and it is thus the angel commanded him to go to Patrick and obey him:--

23. The angel of God came to Declan and said to him "Go quickly to
Patrick and prevent him cursing your kindred and country, for to-night,
in the plain which is called Inneoin, he is fasting against the king,
and if he curses your people they shall be accursed for ever." Thereupon
Declan set out in haste by direction of the angel to Inneoin, i.e. the
place which is in the centre of the plain of Femhin in the northern part
of the Decies. He crossed Slieve Gua [Knockmaeldown] and over the Suir
and arrived on the following morning at the place where Patrick was.
When Patrick and his disciples heard that Declan was there they welcomed
him warmly for they had been told he would not come. Moreover Patrick
and his people received him with great honour. But Declan made obeisance
to Patrick and besought him earnestly that he should not execrate his
people and that he should not curse them nor the land in which they
dwelt, and he promised to allow Patrick do as he pleased. And Patrick
replied:--"On account of your prayer not only shall I not curse them but
I shall give them a blessing." Declan went thereupon to the place where
was the king of Decies who was a neighbour of his. But he contemned
Patrick and he would not believe him even at the request of Declan.
Moreover Declan promised rewards to him if he would go to Patrick to
receive baptism at his hands and assent to the faith. But he would not
assent on any account. When Declan saw this, scil.:--that the king of
the Decies, who was named Ledban, was obstinate in his infidelity and
in his devilry--through fear lest Patrick should curse his race
and country--he (Declan) turned to the assembly and addressed
them:--"Separate yourselves from this accursed man lest you become
yourselves accursed on his account, for I have myself baptised and
blessed you, but come you," said he, "with us, to Patrick, whom God has
sent to bless you, for he has been chosen Archbishop and chief Patron
of all Erin; moreover, I have a right to my own patrimony and to be king
over you as that man (Ledban) has been." At this speech they all arose
and followed Declan who brought them into the presence of Patrick and
said to the latter:--"See how the whole people of the Deisi have come
with me as their Lord to thee and they have left the accursed prince
whose subjects they have been, and behold they are ready to reverence
you and to obey you for it is from me they have received baptism." At
this Patrick rose up with his followers and he blessed the people of the
Deisi and not them alone, but their woods and water and land. Whereupon
the chiefs and nobles of the Deisi said:--"Who will be King or Lord over
us now?" And Declan replied:--"I am your lord and whomsoever I shall
appoint offer you as lord, Patrick and all of us will bless, and he
shall be king over you all." And he whom Declan appointed was Feargal
MacCormac a certain young man of the nation of the Deisi who was a
kinsman of Declan himself. He (Declan) set him in the midst of the
assembly in the king's place and he was pleasing to all. Whereupon
Patrick and Declan blessed him and each of them apart proclaimed him
chieftain. Patrick moreover promised the young man that he should be
brave and strong in battle, that the land should be fruitful during his
reign. Thus have the kings of the Deisi always been.

24. After these things Declan and Feargal Mac Cormac (king of the Deisi)
and his people gave a large area of land to Patrick in the neighbourhood
of Magh Feimhin and this belongs to his successors ever since and great
lordship there. And the place which was given over to him is not far
from the Suir. There is a great very clear fountain there which is
called "Patrick's Well" and this was dear to Patrick. After this, with
blessing, they took leave of one another and Patrick returned to Cashel
to Aongus Mac Natfrich and Declan went with him.

25. A miracle was wrought at that time on Declan through the
intercession and prayers of Patrick for as Declan was walking carelessly
along he trod upon a piece of sharp iron which cut his foot so that
blood flowed freely and Declan began to limp. Ailbe of Emly was present
at this miracle and Sechnall a bishop of Patrick's and a holy and wise
man, and he is said to be the first bishop buried in Ireland. The wound
which Declan had received grieved them very much. Patrick was informed
of the accident and was grieved thereat. He said:--"Heal, O Master (i.e.
God), the foot of your own servant who bears much toil and hardship on
your account." Patrick laid his hand on the wounded foot and made over
it the sign of the cross when immediately the flow of blood ceased,
the lips of the wound united, a cicatrix formed upon it and a cure
was effected. Then Declan rose up with his foot healed and joined in
praising God. The soldiers and fighting men who were present cried out
loudly, blessing God and the saints.

26. As Patrick and the saints were in Cashel, i.e. Ailbe and Declan with
their disciples, in the territory of Aongus Mac Nathfrich, they made
much progress against paganism and errors in faith and they converted
them (the pagans) to Christianity. It was ordained by Patrick and Aongus
Mac Natfrich in presence of the assembly, that the Archbishopric of
Munster should belong to Ailbe, and to Declan, in like manner, was
ordained (committed) his own race, i.e. the Deisi, whom he had converted
to be his parish and his episcopate. As the Irish should serve Patrick,
so should the Deisi serve Declan as their patron, and Patrick made the
"rann":--

"Humble Ailbe the Patrick of Munster, greater than any saying, Declan,
Patrick of the Deisi--the Decies to Declan for ever."

This is equivalent to saying that Ailbe was a second Patrick and that
Declan was a second Patrick of the Decies. After that, when the king had
bidden them farewell and they had all taken leave of one another, the
saints returned to their respective territories to sow therein the seed
of faith.

27. Declan and Ferghal Mac Cormac, king of the Deisi, with his army and
followers, met one another at Indeoin and they made still more strong
on the people the bond of Christian obligation. The king we have already
mentioned, scil.:--Ledban, the recusant to the Christian name, was
rejected of all and he came to nothing, leaving no knowledge (memory) of
his history, as is written of the enemies of the faith:--"Their memory
perisheth like a sound" [Psalm 9:7]. Moreover Declan and Fergal and the
chief men of the Deisi decreed this as the place where the king of the
Deisi should be inaugurated for ever thenceforward, because it was there
Patrick and Declan blessed the king, Fergal; moreover tradition states
that it was there the kings were crowned and ruled over the Deisi in
pagan times.

28. At that time there broke out a dreadful plague in Munster and it
was more deadly in Cashel than elsewhere. Thus it affected those whom it
attacked: it first changed their colour to yellow and then killed them.
Now Aongus had, in a stone fort called "Rath na nIrlann," on the western
side of Cashel, seven noble hostages. It happened that in one and the
same night they all died of the plague. The king was much affected
thereat and he gave orders to have the fact concealed lest it should
bring disgrace or even war upon him, for the hostages were scions of the
strongest and most powerful families in Munster. On the morrow however
Declan came to Cashel and talked with Aonghus. The king welcomed him
heartily and addressing him said to him in presence of persons of his
court, "I pray you, Declan, servant of God, that in the name of Christ
you would raise to life for me the seven hostages whom I held in bondage
from the chieftains of Munster. They have died from the plague of which
you hear, and I fear their fathers will raise war and rebellion against
me, for they are men of strength and power, and indeed we are ashamed of
their death, for they will say that it is we ourselves who killed them."
Declan answered the king, saying to him:--"Such a matter as this--to
raise one to life from death--belongs to Omnipotence alone--but I shall
do whatever is in my power. I go where the bodies lie and pray to God
for them and let Him do in their regard what seems best to Him." Next,
Declan, with a multitude and his disciples together with the king's
councillors, went to the place where the corpses of the young men lay.
The king followed after them until he came in sight of the bodies.
Declan, full of divine faith, entered the house wherein they lay and he
sprinkled holy water over them and prayed for them in the presence of
all, saying:--"O Lord Jesus Christ, only Son of the living God, for
thine own name's sake wake the dead that they may be strengthened in
the Catholic faith through our instrumentality." Thereupon, at Declan's
prayer, the group (of corpses) revived and they moved their eyelids and
Declan said to them "In the name of Christ, our Saviour, stand up and
bless and glorify God." And at his words they rose up immediately and
spoke to all. Declan then announced to the king that they were alive and
well. When people saw this remarkable miracle they all gave glory and
praise to God. The fame of Declan thereupon spread throughout Erin and
the king rejoiced for restoration of his hostages.

29. After this the people of Cashel besought Bishop Declan to bless
their city and banish the plague from them and to intercede with God for
those stricken with sickness who could not escape from its toils. Declan
seeing the people's faith prayed to God and signed with the sign of
Redemption the four points of the compass. As he concluded, there was
verified the saying of Christ to His disciples when leaving them and
going to heaven:--"Super aegros imponent manus et bene habebunt" [Mark
16:18] ("I shall place my hands on the sick and they shall be healed").
Soon as Declan had made the sign of the cross each one who was ill
became well and not alone were these restored to health but (all the
sick) of the whole region round about in whatsoever place there were
persons ailing. Moreover the plague was banished from every place and
all rejoiced greatly thereat as well as on account of the resurrection
of the dead men we have narrated. The king thereupon ordered tribute and
honour to Declan and his successors from himself and from every king
who should hold Cashel ever after. Upon this the glorious bishop Declan
blessed Aongus together with his city and people and returned back to
his own place.

30. One night Declan was a guest at the house of a wealthy man who dwelt
in the southern part of Magh Femhin; this is the kind of person his
host was, scil.:--a pagan who rejected the true faith, and his name
was Dercan. He resolved to amuse himself at the Christians' expense;
accordingly he ordered his servants to kill a dog secretly, to cut off
its head and feet and to bury them in the earth and then to cook the
flesh properly and to set it before Declan and his company as their
meal. Moreover he directed that the dog should be so fat that his flesh
might pass as mutton. When, in due course, it was cooked, the flesh,
together with bread and other food, was laid before Declan and his
following. At that moment Declan had fallen asleep but he was aroused
by his disciples that he might bless their meal. He observed to
them:--"Indeed I see, connected with this meat, the ministry of the
devil." Whereupon he questioned the waiters as to the meat--what kind it
was and whence procured. They replied: "Our master ordered us to kill
a fat ram for you and we have done as he commanded." Declan said, "Our
Master is Jesus Christ and may He show us what it is that connects the
ministry of Satan with this meat and preserve thy servants from eating
forbidden food." As he spoke thus Declan saw in the meat the claw of a
dog, for, without intending it, they had boiled one quarter of the
dog with its paw adhering; they thought they had buried it (the
incriminating limb) with the other paws. Declan exclaimed, "This is not
a sheep's but a dog's foot." When the attendants heard this they went at
once to their master and related the matter to him. Then Dercan came
to Declan, accepted his faith and received Baptism at his hands, giving
himself and his posterity to Declan for ever. Moreover he gave his
homestead to Declan and his people were baptised. After this Dercan
requested that Declan should bless something in his homestead which
might remain as a memorial of him (Dercan) for ever. Then Declan blessed
a bell which he perceived there and its name is Clog-Dhercain ("Dercan's
Bell"); moreover, he declared: "I endow it with this virtue (power) that
if the king of Decies march around it when going to battle, against his
enemies, or to punish violation of his rights, he shall return safely
and with victory." This promise has been frequently fulfilled, but proud
(men) undertaking battle or conflict unjustly even if they march around
it do not obtain victory but success remains with the enemy. The name of
that homestead was Teach-Dhercain ("Dercain's House") and its name now
is Coningean, from the claw [con] of the hound or dog aforesaid. To this
place came the saintly concourse, scil:--Coman and Ultan, MacErc and
Mocoba and Maclaisren, who dedicated themselves to (the service of) God
and placed themselves under the spiritual rule and sway of Declan.

31. Thereupon Declan established a monastery in that place, scil.--in
Coningin--and he placed there this holy community with a further band of
disciples. Ultan however he took away with him to the place whither he
went.

32. On another (subsequent) occasion Declan visited Bregia, i.e. the
original territory which belonged to his race previous to the expulsion
of his ancestors. There he was treated with particular honour by the
king of Tara and by the chieftains of Meath by whom he was beloved,
since it was from themselves (their tribe and territory) that his
forbears had gone out, for that region was the patrimony of his race and
within it lies Tara. Declan instituted therein a monastery of Canons,
on land which he received from the king, and it is from him the place is
named. Moreover he left therein a relic or illuminated book and a famous
gospel which he was accustomed to carry always with him. The gospel is
still preserved with much honour in the place and miracles are wrought
through it. After this again he turned towards Munster.

33. Declan was once travelling through Ossory when he wished to remain
for the night in a certain village. But the villagers not only did not
receive him but actually drove him forth by force of arms. The saint
however prayed to God that it might happen to them what the Sacred
Scripture says, "Vengeance is mine I will repay" [Deuteronomy 32:35].
The dwellers in the village, who numbered sixty, died that same night
with the exception of two men and ten women to whom the conduct of the
others towards the saint had been displeasing. On the morrow these
men and women came humbly to the place where Declan was and they told
him--what he himself foreknew--how miserably the others had died. They
themselves did penance and they bestowed on Declan a suitable site
whereon he built a monastery and he got another piece of land and had
the dead buried where he built the monastery. The name of that monastery
is Cill-Colm-Dearg. This Colm-Dearg was a kind, holy man and a disciple
of Declan. He was of East Leinster, i.e. of the Dal Meiscorb, and it
is from him that the monastery is named. When he (Declan) had completed
that place he came to his own territory again, i.e. to the Decies.

34. On a certain day Declan came to a place called Ait-Breasail and the
dwellers therein would not allow him to enter their village; moreover
they hid all their boats so that he could not go into his own island,
for they hated him very much. In consideration however of the sanctity
of his servant, who prayed in patience, God the All-Powerful turned the
sea into dry land as you have already heard. Declan passed the night in
an empty stable out in the plain and the people of the village did not
give him even a fire. Whereupon, appropriately the anger of God fell on
them, who had not compassion enough to supply the disciple of God with a
fire. There came fire from heaven on them to consume them all [together
with their] homestead and village, so that the place has been ever
since a wilderness accursed, as the prophet writes: "civitates eorum
destruxisti" [Psalm 9:7], i.e. the dwellings of the unmerciful are laid
waste.

35. On yet another occasion Declan was in his own region--travelling
over Slieve Gua in the Decies, when his horse from some cause got lame
so that he could proceed no further. Declan however, seeing a herd of
deer roaming the mountain close to him, said to one of his people: "Go,
and bring me for my chariot one of these deer to replace my horse and
take with you this halter for him." Without any misgiving the disciple
went on till he reached the deer which waited quietly for him. He chose
the animal which was largest and therefore strongest, and, bringing
him back, yoked him to the chariot. The deer thereupon obediently and
without effort carried Bishop Declan till he came to Magh Femhin, where,
when he reached a house of entertainment, the saint unloosed the stag
and bade him to go free as was his nature. Accordingly, at the command
of the saintly man and in the presence of all, the stag returned on
the same road back (to the mountain). Dormanach is the name of the man
aforesaid who brought the stag to Declan and him Declan blessed and gave
him a piece of land on the north of Decies close by the Eoghanacht and
his posterity live till now in that place.

36. On another occasion, Declan, accompanied, as usual, by a large
following, was travelling, when one member of the party fell on the road
and broke his shin bone in twain. Declan saw the accident and, pitying
the injured man, he directed an individual of the company to bandage the
broken limb so that the sufferer might not die through excess of pain
and loss of blood. All replied that they could not endure to dress the
wound owing to their horror thereof. But there was one of the company,
Daluadh by name, who faced the wound boldly and confidently and said:
"In the name of Christ and of Declan our patron I shall be surgeon to
this foot"; and he said that jestingly. Nevertheless he bandaged the
foot carefully and blessed it aright in the name of God and Declan, and
in a little while the wound healed and they all gave praise to God.
Then Declan said to Daluadh: "You promised to be surgeon to that foot
in Christ's name and in mine and God has vouchsafed to heal it at these
words: on this account you will be a true physician for ever and your
children and your seed after you for ever shall also possess the healing
art, and whomsoever they shall practise healing upon in God's name
and mine, provided there be no hatred [in their hearts] nor too great
covetousness of a physician's fee to him, God and myself shall send
relief." This promise of Declan has been fulfilled in the case of that
family.

37. On another occasion, as Declan was travelling in the northern part
of Magh Femhin beside the Suir, he met there a man who was carrying
a little infant to get it baptised. Declan said to the people [his
"muinntear," or following]: "Wait here till I baptise yonder child," for
it was revealed by the Holy Ghost to him that he [the babe] should serve
God. The attendant replied to him that they had neither a vessel nor
salt for the baptism. Declan said: "We have a wide vessel, the Suir,
and God will send us salt, for this child is destined to become holy and
wonderful [in his works]." Thereupon Declan took up a fistful of earth
and, making prayer in his heart to God, he signed the clay with the sign
of the cross of redemption. It (the handful of earth) became white, dry
salt, and all, on seeing it, gave thanks and honour to God and Declan.
The infant was baptised there and the name of Ciaran given him. Declan
said: "Bring up my spiritual son carefully and send him, at a fitting
age, for education to a holy man who is well instructed in the faith for
he will become a shining bright pillar in the Church." And it was
this child, Ciaran Mac Eochaidh, who founded in after years a famous
monastery (from which he migrated to heaven) and another place
(monastery) besides. He worked many miracles and holy signs and this is
the name of his monastery Tiprut [Tubrid] and this is where it is:--in
the western part of the Decies in Ui Faithe between Slieve Grot [Galtee]
and Sieve Cua and it is within the bishopric of Declan.

38. On another day there came a woman to Declan's monastery not far from
the city where she dwelt. She committed a theft that day in Declan's
monastery as she had often done previously, and this is the thing
she stole--a "habellum" [possibly an item of tribute]; she departed
homewards taking it with her and there met her a group of people on the
highway, and the earth, in their presence, swallowed her up, and she
cast out the tabellum from her bosom and it was quickly turned into a
stone which the wayfarers took and brought with them to Declan. Declan
himself had in supernatural vision seen all that happened to the woman
in punishment of her theft, and the name of Declan was magnified owing
to those marvels so that fear took possession of all-those present and
those absent. The stone in question remains still in Declan's graveyard
in his own town of Ardmore-Declain, where it stands on an elevated place
in memory of this miracle.

39. A rich man named Fintan was childless, for his wife was barren for
many years. He himself, with his wife, visited Declan and promised large
alms and performance of good works provided he (Declan) would pray that
they might have children: they held it as certain that if Declan but
prayed for them God would grant them children. Declan therefore, praying
to God and blessing the pair, said: "Proceed to your home and through
God's bounty you shall have offspring." The couple returned home, with
great joy for the blessing and for the promise of the offspring. The
following night, Fintan lay with his wife and she conceived and brought
forth twin sons, scil.: Fiacha and Aodh, who, together with their
children and descendants were under tribute and service to God and
Declan.

40. When it was made known to a certain holy man, scil.:--Ailbe of Emly
Iubar, chief bishop of Munster, that his last days had come, he said to
his disciples: "Beloved brethren, I wish, before I die, to visit my very
dear fellow worker, scil.:--Declan." After this Ailbe set out on the
journey and an angel of God came to Declan notifying him that Ailbe was
on his way to visit him. On the angel's notification Declan ordered his
disciples to prepare the house for Ailbe's coming. He himself went
to meet Ailbe as far as the place which is called Druim Luctraidh
[Luchluachra]. Thence they came home together and Ailbe, treated with
great honour by Declan and his people, stayed fourteen pleasant
days. After that the aged saint returned home again to his own city,
scil.:--to Emly Iubar. Declan came and many of his people, escorting
Ailbe, to Druim Luchtradh, and Ailbe bade him return to his own city.
The two knew they should not see one another in this world ever again.
In taking leave of one another, therefore, they shed plentiful tears
of sorrow and they instituted an everlasting compact and league between
their successors in that place. Ailbe moreover blessed the city of
Declan, his clergy and people and Declan did the same for Ailbe and they
kissed one another in token of love and peace and each returned to his
own city.

41. On a certain day the Castle of Cinaedh, King of the Deisi, took fire
and it burned violently. It happened however that Declan was proceeding
towards the castle on some business and he was grieved to see it
burning; he flung towards it the staff to which we have referred in
connection with the drying up of the sea, and it (the staff) flew
hovering in the air with heavenly wings till it reached the midst of
the flame and the fire was immediately extinguished of its own accord
through the grace of God and virtue of the staff and of Declan to whom
it belonged. The place from which Declan cast the staff was a long mile
distant from the castle and when the king, i.e. Cinaedh, and all the
others witnessed this miracle they were filled with amazement and gave
thanks to God and to Declan when they came to know that it was he who
wrought it. Now the place where the castle stands is not far from the
Suir, i.e. on the south side of it and the place from which Declan cast
the staff is beside a ford which is in the Suir or a stream which flows
beside the monastery called Mag Laca [Molough] which the holy virgins,
daughters of the king of Decies, have built in honour of God. There is a
pile of stones and a cross in the place to commemorate this miracle.

42. On another occasion there approached a foreign fleet towards
Declan's city and this was their design--to destroy and to plunder it of
persons and of cattle, because they (the foreigners) were people hostile
to the faith. Many members of the community ran with great haste to tell
Declan of the fleet which threatened the town and to request him to beg
the assistance of God against the invaders. Declan knew the man amongst
his own disciples who was holiest and most abounding in grace, scil.,
Ultan, already mentioned, and him he ordered to pray to God against the
fleet. Ultan had pity on the Christian people and he went instantly, at
the command of Declan, in front of the fleet and he held his left hand
against it, and, on the spot, the sea swallowed them like sacks full of
lead, and the drowned sailors were changed into large rocks which stand
not far from the mouth of the haven where they are visible (standing)
high out of the sea from that time till now. All Christians who
witnessed this rejoiced and were glad and they gave great praise and
glory to God and to Declan their own patron who caused the working of
this miracle and of many other miracles besides. Next there arose a
contention between Ultan and Declan concerning this miracle, for Ultan
attributed it to Declan and Declan credited it to Ultan; and it
has become a proverb since in Ireland when people hear of danger or
jeopardy:--"The left hand of Ultan against you (the danger)." Ultan
became, after the death of Declan, a miracle-working abbot of many other
holy monks.

43. The holy and glorious archbishop, i.e. Patrick, sent one of his
own followers to Declan with power and authority (delegation) from the
archbishop. And proceeding through the southern part of Decies he
was drowned in a river [the Lickey] there, two miles from the city of
Declan. When Declan heard this he was grieved and he said: "Indeed it
grieves me that a servant of God and of Patrick who sent him to visit
me, having travelled all over Ireland, should be drowned in a river of
my own territory. Get my chariot for me that I may go in haste to see
his corpse, so that Patrick may come to hear of the worry and the grief
I have undergone because of his disciple's death." The body had been
recovered before the arrival of Declan by others who were close at hand
and it had been placed on a bier to be carried to Ciaran for interment.
Declan however met them on the way, when he ordered the body to be laid
down on the ground. They supposed he was about to recite the Office
for the Dead. He (Declan) advanced to the place where the bier was
and lifted the sheet covering the face. It (the face) looked dark and
deformed as is usual in the case of the drowned. He prayed to God
and shed tears, but no one heard aught of what he said. After this he
commanded:--"In the name of the Trinity, in the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost whose religious yoke I bear myself,
arise to us for God has given your life to me." He (the dead man) rose
up immediately at the command and he greeted Declan and all the others.
Whereupon Declan and his disciples received him with honour. At first
he was not completely cured but (was) like one convalescent until
(complete) health returned to him by degrees again. He however
accompanied Declan and remained some time with him and there was much
rejoicing in Declan's city on account of the miracle and his (Declan's)
name and fame extended over the country generally. This disciple of
Patrick was named Ballin; he returned with great joy and he told him
(Patrick) that Declan had raised him from the dead. To many others
likewise he related what had happened to him. Patrick, in presence of
many persons, hearing of the miracle gave glory and thanks to God and
the name of Declan was magnified.

44. With this extraordinary miracle wrought by Declan we wish to
conclude our discourse. The number of miracles he wrought, but which are
not written here, you are to judge and gather from what we have written.
And we wish moreover that you would understand that he healed the
infirm, that he gave sight to the eyes of the blind, cleansed lepers,
and gave "their walk" to cripples; that he obtained hearing for the
deaf, and that he healed many and various diseases in many different
places throughout Ireland--(things) which are not written here because
of their length and because they are so numerous to record, for fear it
should tire readers to hear so much said of one particular person. On
that account we shall pass them by.

45. When Declan realised that his last days were at hand and that
the time remaining to him was very short he summoned to him his own
spiritual son, scil., MacLiag (residing) in the monastery which is on
the eastern side of the Decies close to the Leinstermen in order that,
at the hour of death, he might receive the Body and Blood of Christ and
the Sacraments of the Church from his hands. Thereupon he foretold to
his disciples the day of his death and he commanded them to bring him to
his own city, for it was not there he dwelt at the time but in a small
venerable cell which he had ordered to be built for him between the hill
called Ardmore Declain and the ocean--in a narrow place at the brink of
the sea by which there flows down from the hill above a small shining
stream about which are trees and bushes all around, and it is called
Disert Declain. Thence to the city it is a short mile and the reason why
Declan used go there was to avoid turmoil and noise so that he might be
able to read and pray and fast there. Indeed it was not easy for him to
stay even there because of the multitude of disciples and paupers
and pilgrims and beggars who followed him thither. Declan was however
generous and very sympathetic and on that account it is recorded by
tradition that a great following (of poor, &c.), generally accompanied
him and that moreover the little cell was very dear to him for the
reason we have given, and many devout people have made it their practice
to dwell therein.

46. When Declan fell ill and became weak in body, but still strong in
hope and faith and love of God, he returned to his own city--his people
and disciples and clergy surrounding him. He discoursed to them on the
commands of God and he enjoined on them to live holily after his death,
to be submissive to authority and to follow as closely as possible the
way he had marked out and to preserve his city in a state of piety
and under religious rule. And when they had all heard the discourse it
grieved them greatly to perceive, from what he had said, he realised
that in a short time he would go away to heaven from them. But they were
consoled by his gentle words and then there came to him the holy man,
to wit, MacLiag, at his own request, already referred to. He [Declan]
received the Body and Blood of Christ and the Sacraments of the Church
from his [MacLiag's] hand--surrounded by holy men and his disciples,
and he blessed his people and his dependents and his poor, and he kissed
them in token of love and peace. Thus, having banished images and the
sacrifices to idols, having converted multitudes to the true faith,
having established monasteries and ecclesiastical orders in various
places, having spent his whole life profitably and holily, this glorious
bishop went with the angels to heaven on the ninth day of the Kalends of
August and his body was blessed and honoured with Masses and chanting
by holy men and by the people of the Decies and by his own monks and
disciples collected from every quarter at the time of his death. He was
buried with honour in his own city--in Declan's High-Place--in the tomb
which by direction of an angel he had himself indicated--which moreover
has wrought wonders and holy signs from that time to now. He departed
to the Unity of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost in Saecula
Saeculorum; Amen. FINIS.


The poor brother, Michael O'Clery originally copied this life of Declan
in Cashel, from the book of Eochy O'Heffernan. The date, A.D., at which
that ancient book of Eochy was written is 1582. And the same life has
now been re-written in the Convent of the Friars at Druiske, the date,
A.D., 27th February, 1629.

And this Life of St. Declan was transcribed electronically for the
public domain by Dennis McCarthy, a layman, in the city of Atlanta in
Georgia of the United States of America. He copied this life from the
1914 translation from the Irish to the English tongue by Rev. P. Power
of University College, Cork. Dennis has completed this work on February
27 in the year of Our Lord 1997, and prayerfully dedicated it to the
memory of his deceased siblings.




NOTE


The Irish text of the "rann" from paragraph 26 reads:

  Ailbe umal; Patraicc Muman, mo gacrath,
  Declan, Patraicc na nDeisi: na Deisi ag Declan gan brat.


And the Latin rendering:

     Albeus est humilis dixit Caephurnia proles;
     Patriciusque esto hinc Ailbee Momonia.
     Declanus pariter patronus Desius esto;
     Inter Desenses Patriciusque suos.

TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE

The source for this text includes an introduction, Irish text & English
translation on facing pages, and notes. The introduction and the notes
are quite lengthy and should take longer to transcribe than the English
text. Except for the part of the introduction specific to the "Life of
Declan" and a few notes transplanted in brackets to the body of the text
I have not transcribed them. Due to inexperience with the Irish language
and its alphabet/font I have decided not to attempt to transcribe the
Irish text. Hopefully someone with the appropriate talent and interest
will undertake that task some day. I have corrected the errata as
indicated in the source and a few obvious printer errors. Please note
that this text is full of variant spellings of names and words sometimes
inconsistently applied.

DET NYE TESTAMENTE



Matt.

Matt. 1

  1.  Jesu Kristi Davids Søns, Abrahams Søns, Slægtsbog.
  2.  Abraham avlede Isak; og Isak avlede Jakob; og Jakob avlede Juda
      og hans Brødre;
  3.  og Juda avlede Fares og Zara med Thamar; og Fares avlede Esrom;
      og Esrom avlede Aram;
  4.  og Aram avlede Aminadab; og Aminadab avlede Nasson; og Nasson
      avlede Salmon;
  5.  og Salmon avlede Boas med Rakab; og Boas avlede Obed med Ruth;
      og Obed avlede Isaj;
  6.  og Isaj avlede Kong David; og David avlede Salomon med Urias's
      Hustru;
  7.  og Salomon avlede Roboam; og Roboam avlede Abia; og Abia avlede
      Asa;
  8.  og Asa avlede Josafat; og Josafat avlede Joram; og Joram avlede
      Ozias;
  9.  og Ozias avlede Joatham; og Joatham avlede Akas; og Akas avlede
      Ezekias;
 10.  og Ezekias avlede Manasse; og Manasse avlede Amon; og Amon
      avlede Josias;
 11.  og Josias avlede Jekonias og hans Brødre på den Tid, da
      Bortførelsen til Babylon fandt Sted.
 12.  Men efter Bortførelsen til Babylon avlede Jekonias Salathiel; og
      Salathiel avlede Zorobabel;
 13.  og Zorobabel avlede Abiud; og Abiud avlede Eliakim: og Eliakim
      avlede Azor;
 14.  og Azor avlede Sadok; og Sadok avlede Akim; og Akim avlede
      Eliud;
 15.  og Eliud avlede Eleazar; og Eleazar avlede Matthan; og Matthan
      avlede Jakob;
 16.  og Jakob avlede Josef, Marias Mand; af hende blev Jesus født,
      som kaldes Kristus.
 17.  Altså ere alle Slægtledene fra Abraham indtil David fjorten
      Slægtled, og fra David indtil Bortførelsen til Babylon fjorten
      Slægtled, og fra Bortførelsen til Babylon indtil Kristus fjorten
      Slægtled.

 18.  Men med Jesu Kristi Fødsel gik det således til. Da Maria, hans
      Moder, var trolovet med Josef, fandtes hun, førend de kom
      sammen, at være frugtsommelig af den Helligånd.
 19.  Men da Josef, hendes Mand, var retfærdig og ikke vilde beskæmme
      hende offentligt, besluttede han hemmeligt at skille sig fra
      hende.
 20.  Men idet han tænkte derpå, se, da viste en Herrens Engel sig for
      ham i en drøm og sagde: "Josef, Davids Søn! frygt ikke for at
      tage din Hustru Maria til dig; thi det, som er avlet i hende, er
      af den Helligånd.
 21.  Og hun skal føde en Søn, og du skal kalde hans Navn Jesus; thi
      han skal frelse sit Folk fra deres Synder."
 22.  Men dette er alt sammen sket, for at det skulde opfyldes, som er
      talt af Herren ved Profeten, som siger:
 23.  "Se, Jomfruen skal blive frugtsommelig og føde en Søn, og man
      skal kalde hans Navn Immanuel", hvilket er udlagt: Gud med os.
 24.  Men da Josef vågnede op at Søvnen, gjorde han, som Herrens Engel
      havde befalet ham, og han tog sin Hustru til sig.
 25.  Og han kendte hende ikke, førend hun havde født sin Søn, den
      førstefødte, og han kaldte hans Navn Jesus.

Matt. 2

  1.  Men da Jesus var født i Bethlehem i Judæa, i Kong Herodes's
      Dage, se, da kom der vise fra Østerland til Jerusalem og sagde:
  2.  "Hvor er den Jødernes Konge, som er født? thi vi have set hans
      Stjerne i Østen og ere komne for at tilbede ham."
  3.  Men da Kong Herodes hørte det, blev han forfærdet, og hele
      Jerusalem med ham;
  4.  og han forsamlede alle Folkets Ypperstepræster og skriftkloge og
      adspurgte dem, hvor Kristus skulde fødes.
  5.  Og de sagde til ham: "I Bethlehem i Judæa; thi således er der
      skrevet ved Profeten:
  6.  Og du, Bethlehem i Judas Land, er ingenlunde den mindste iblandt
      Judas Fyrster; thi af dig skal der udgå en Fyrste, som skal
      vogte mit Folk Israel."
  7.  Da kaldte Herodes hemmeligt de vise og fik af dem nøje Besked om
      Tiden, da Stjernen havde ladet sig til Syne.
  8.  Og han sendte dem til Bethlehem og sagde: "Går hen og forhører
      eder nøje om Barnet; men når I have fundet det, da forkynder mig
      det, for at også jeg kan komme og tilbede det."
  9.  Men da de havde hørt Kongen, droge de bort; og se, Stjernen, som
      de havde set i Østen, gik foran dem, indtil den kom og stod oven
      over, hvor Barnet var.
 10.  Men da de så Stjernen, bleve de såre meget glade.
 11.  Og de gik ind i Huset og så Barnet med dets Moder Maria og faldt
      ned og tilbade det og oplode deres Gemmer og ofrede det Gaver,
      Guld og Røgelse og Myrra.
 12.  Og da de vare blevne advarede af Gud i en Drøm, at de ikke
      skulde vende tilbage til Herodes, droge de ad en anden Vej
      tilbage til deres Land.

 13.  Men da de vare dragne bort, se, da viser en Herrens Engel sig i
      en Drøm for Josef og siger: "Stå op, og tag Barnet og dets Moder
      med dig og fly til Ægypten og bliv der, indtil jeg siger dig
      til; thi Herodes vil søge efter Barnet for at dræbe det."
 14.  Og han stod op og tog Barnet og dets Moder med sig om Natten og
      drog bort til Ægypten.
 15.  Og han var der indtil Herodes's Død, for at det skulde opfyldes,
      som er talt af Herren ved Profeten, der siger: "Fra Ægypten
      kaldte jeg min Søn."

 16.  Da Herodes nu så, at han var bleven skuffet af de vise, blev han
      såre vred og sendte Folk hen og lod alle Drengebørn ihjelslå,
      som vare i Bethlehem og i hele dens Omegn, fra to År og
      derunder, efter den Tid, som han havde fået Besked om af de
      vise.
 17.  Da blev det opfyldt,som er talt ved Profeten Jeremias,som siger:
 18.  "En Røst blev hørt i Rama, Gråd og megen Jamren; Rakel græd over
      sine Børn og vilde ikke lade sig trøste, thi de ere ikke mere."

 19.  Men da Herodes var død, se, da viser en Herrens Engel sig i en
      Drøm for Josef i Ægypten og siger:
 20.  "Stå op, og tag Barnet og dets Moder med dig, og drag til
      Israels Land; thi de ere døde, som efterstræbte Barnets Liv."
 21.  Og han stod op og tog Barnet og dets Moder med sig og kom til
      Israels Land.
 22.  Men da han hørte, at Arkelaus var Konge over Judæa i sin Fader
      Herodes's Sted, frygtede han for at komme derhen; og han blev
      advaret af Gud i en Drøm og drog bort til Galilæas Egne.
 23.  Og han kom og tog Bolig i en By, som kaldes Nazareth, for at det
      skulde opfyldes, som er talt ved Profeterne, at han skulde
      kaldes Nazaræer.

Matt. 3

  1.  Men i de Dage fremstår Johannes Døberen og prædiker i Judæas
      Ørken og siger:
  2.  "Omvender eder, thi Himmeriges Rige er kommet nær."
  3.  Thi han er den, om hvem der er talt ved Profeten Esajas, som
      siger: "Der er en Røst af en, som råber i Ørkenen: Bereder
      Herrens Vej, gører hans Stier jævne!"
  4.  Men han, Johannes, havde sit Klædebon af Kamelhår og et
      Læderbælte om sin Lænd; og hans Føde var Græshopper og vild
      Honning.
  5.  Da drog Jerusalem ud til ham og hele Judæa og hele Omegnen om
      Jordan.
  6.  Og de bleve døbte af ham i Floden Jordan, idet de bekendte deres
      Synder.
  7.  Men da han så mange af Farisæerne og Saddukæerne komme til hans
      Dåb, sagde han til dem: "I Øgleunger! hvem har lært eder at fly
      fra den kommende Vrede?
  8.  Bærer da Frugt, som er Omvendelsen værdig,
  9.  og mener ikke at kunne sige ved eder selv: Vi have Abraham til
      Fader; thi jeg siger eder, at Gud kan opvække Abraham Børn af
      disse Sten.
 10.  Men Øksen ligger allerede ved Roden af Træerne; så bliver da
      hvert Træ, som ikke bærer god Frugt, omhugget og kastet i Ilden.
 11.  Jeg døber eder med Vand til Omvendelse, men den, som kommer
      efter mig, er stærkere end jeg, han, hvis Sko jeg ikke er værdig
      at bære; han skal døbe eder med den Helligånd og Ild.
 12.  Hans Kasteskovl er i hans Hånd, og han skal gennemrense sin Lo
      og samle sin Hvede i Laden; men Avnerne skal han opbrænde med
      uslukkelig Ild."

 13.  Da kommer Jesus fra Galilæa til Jordan til Johannes for at døbes
      af ham.
 14.  Men Johannes vilde formene ham det og sagde: "Jeg trænger til at
      døbes af dig, og du kommer til mig!"
 15.  Men Jesus svarede og sagde til ham: "Tilsted det nu; thi således
      sømmer det sig for os at fuldkomme al Retfærdighed." Da
      tilsteder han ham det.
 16.  Men da Jesus var bleven døbt, steg han straks op af Vandet, og
      se, Himlene åbnedes for ham, og han så Guds Ånd dale ned som en
      Due og komme over ham.
 17.  Og se, der kom en Røst fra Himlene, som sagde: "Denne er min
      Søn, den elskede, i hvem jeg har Velbehag."

Matt. 4

  1.  Da blev Jesus af Ånden ført op i Ørkenen for at fristes af
      Djævelen.
  2.  Og da han havde fastet fyrretyve Dage og fyrretyve Nætter, blev
      han omsider hungrig.
  3.  Og Fristeren gik til ham og sagde: "Er du Guds Søn, da sig, at
      disse Sten skulle blive Brød."
  4.  Men han svarede og sagde: "Der er skrevet: Mennesket skal ikke
      leve af Brød alene, men af hvert Ord, som udgår igennem Guds
      Mund."
  5.  Da. tager Djævelen ham med sig til den hellige Stad og stiller
      ham på Helligdommens Tinde og siger til ham:
  6.  "Er du Guds Søn, da kast dig herned; thi der er skrevet: Han
      skal give sine Engle Befaling om dig, og de skulle bære dig på
      Hænder, for at du ikke skal støde din Fod på nogen Sten."
  7.  Jesus sagde til ham: "Der er atter skrevet: Du må ikke friste
      Herren din Gud."
  8.  Atter tager Djævelen ham med sig op på et såre højt Bjerg og
      viser ham alle Verdens Riger og deres Herlighed; og han sagde
      til ham:
  9.  "Alt dette vil jeg give dig, dersom du vil falde ned og tilbede
      mig."
 10.  Da siger Jesus til ham: "Vig bort, Satan! thi der er skrevet: Du
      skal tilbede Herren din Gud og tjene ham alene."
 11.  Da forlader Djævelen ham, og se, Engle kom til ham og tjente
      ham.

 12.  Men da Jesus hørte, at Johannes var kastet i Fængsel, drog han
      bort til Galilæa.
 13.  Og han forlod Nazareth og kom og tog Bolig i Kapernaum, som
      ligger ved Søen, i Sebulons og Nafthalis Egne,
 14.  for at det skulde opfyldes, som er talt ved Profeten Esajas, som
      siger:
 15.  "Sebulons Land og Nafthalis Land langs Søen, Landet hinsides
      Jordan, Hedningernes Galilæa,
 16.  det Folk, som sad i Mørke, har set et stort Lys, og for dem, som
      sad i Dødens Land og Skygge, for dem er der opgået et Lys."

 17.  Fra den Tid begyndte Jesus at prædike og sige: "Omvender eder,
      thi Himmeriges Rige er kommet nær."

 18.  Men da han vandrede ved Galilæas Sø, så han to Brødre, Simon,
      som kaldes Peter, og Andreas, hans Broder, i Færd med at kaste
      Garn i Søen; thi de vare Fiskere.
 19.  Og han siger til dem: "Følger efter mig, så vil jeg gøre eder
      til Menneskefiskere."
 20.  Og de forlode straks Garnene og fulgte ham.
 21.  Og da han derfra gik videre, så han to andre Brødre, Jakob,
      Zebedæus's Søn, og Johannes, hans Broder, i Skibet med deres
      Fader Zebedæus, i Færd med at bøde deres Garn, og han kaldte på
      dem.
 22.  Og de forlode straks Skibet og deres Fader og fulgte ham.

 23.  Og Jesus gik omkring i hele Galilæa, idet han lærte i deres
      Synagoger og prædikede Rigets Evangelium og helbredte enhver
      Sygdom og enhver Skrøbelighed iblandt Folket.
 24.  Og hans Ry kom ud over hele Syrien; og de bragte til ham alle
      dem, som lede af mange Hånde Sygdomme og vare plagede af
      Lidelser, både besatte og månesyge og værkbrudne; og han
      helbredte dem.
 25.  Og store Skarer fulgte ham fra Galilæa og Dekapolis og Jerusalem
      og Judæa og fra Landet hinsides Jordan.

Matt. 5

  1.  Men da han så Skarerne, steg han op på Bjerget; og da han havde
      sat sig, gik hans Disciple hen til ham,
  2.  og han oplod sin Mund, lærte dem og sagde:

  3.  "Salige ere de fattige i Ånden, thi Himmeriges Rige er deres.
  4.  Salige ere de, som sørge, thi de skulle husvales.
  5.  Salige ere de sagtmodige, thi de skulle arve Jorden.
  6.  Salige ere de, som hungre og tørste efter Retfærdigheden, thi de
      skulle mættes.
  7.  Salige ere de barmhjertige, thi dem skal vises Barmhjertighed.
  8.  Salige ere de rene af Hjertet, thi de skulle se Gud.
  9.  Salige ere de, som stifte Fred, thi de skulle kaldes Guds Børn.
 10.  Salige ere de, som ere forfulgte for Retfærdigheds Skyld, thi
      Himmeriges Rige er deres.
 11.  Salige ere I, når man håner og forfølger eder og lyver eder alle
      Hånde ondt på for min Skyld.
 12.  Glæder og fryder eder, thi eders Løn skal være stor i Himlene;
      thi således have de forfulgt Profeterne, som vare før eder.

 13.  I ere Jordens Salt; men dersom Saltet mister sin Kraft, hvormed
      skal det da saltes? Det duer ikke til andet end at kastes ud og
      nedtrædes af Menneskene.
 14.  I ere Verdens Lys; en Stad, som ligger på et Bjerg, kan ikke
      skjules.
 15.  Man tænder heller ikke et Lys og sætter det under Skæppen, men
      på Lysestagen; så skinner det for alle dem, som ere i Huset.
 16.  Lader således eders Lys skinne for Menneskene, at de må se eders
      gode Gerninger og ære eders Fader, som er i Himlene.

 17.  Mener ikke, at jeg er kommen for at nedbryde Loven eller
      Profeterne;jeg er ikke kommen for at nedbryde, men for at
      fuldkomme.
 18.  Thi sandelig, siger jeg eder, indtil Himmelen og Jorden forgår,
      skal end ikke det mindste Bogstav eller en Tøddel forgå af
      Loven, indtil det er sket alt sammen.
 19.  Derfor, den, som bryder et at de mindste af disse Bud og lærer
      Menneskene således, han skal kaldes den mindste i Himmeriges
      Rige; men den, som gør dem og lærer dem, han skal kaldes stor i
      Himmeriges Rige.
 20.  Thi jeg siger eder: Uden eders Retfærdighed overgår de
      skriftkloges og Farisæernes, komme I ingenlunde ind i Himmeriges
      Rige.

 21.  I have hørt, at der er sagt til de gamle: Du må ikke slå ihjel,
      men den, som slår ihjel, skal være skyldig for Dommen.
 22.  Men jeg siger eder, at hver den, som bliver vred på sin Broder
      uden Årsag, skal være skyldig for Dommen; og den, som siger til
      sin Broder: Raka! skal være skyldig for Rådet; og den, som
      siger: Du Dåre! skal være skyldig til Helvedes Ild.
 23.  Derfor, når du ofrer din Gave på Alteret og der kommer i Hu, at
      din Broder har noget imod dig,
 24.  så lad din Gave blive der foran Alteret, og gå hen, forlig dig
      først med din Broder, og kom da og offer din Gave!
 25.  Vær velvillig mod din Modpart uden Tøven, medens du er med ham
      på Vejen, for at Modparten ikke skal overgive dig til Dommeren,
      og Dommeren til Tjeneren, og du skal kastes i Fængsel.
 26.  Sandelig, siger jeg dig, du skal ingenlunde komme ud derfra,
      førend du får betalt den sidste Hvid.
 27.  I have hørt, at der er sagt: Du må ikke bedrive Hor.
 28.  Men jeg siger eder, at hver den, som ser på en Kvinde for at
      begære hende, har allerede bedrevet Hor med hende i sit Hjerte.
 29.  Men dersom dit højre Øje forarger dig, så riv det ud, og kast
      det fra dig; thi det er bedre for dig, at eet af dine Lemmer
      fordærves, end at hele dit Legeme bliver kastet i Helvede.
 30.  Og om din højre Hånd forarger dig, så hug den af og kast den fra
      dig; thi det er bedre for dig, at eet af dine Lemmer fordærves,
      end at hele dit Legeme kommer i Helvede.

 31.  Og der er sagt: Den, som skiller sig fra sin Hustru, skal give
      hende et Skilsmissebrev.
 32.  Men jeg siger eder, at enhver, som skiller sig fra sin Hustru,
      uden for Hors Skyld, gør, at hun bedriver Hor, og den, som tager
      en fraskilt Kvinde til Ægte, bedriver Hor.

 33.  I have fremdeles hørt, at der er sagt til de gamle: Du må ikke
      gøre nogen falsk Ed, men du skal holde Herren dine Eder.
 34.  Men jeg siger eder, at I må aldeles ikke sværge, hverken ved
      Himmelen, thi den er Guds Trone,
 35.  ej heller ved Jorden, thi den er hans Fodskammel, ej heller ved
      Jerusalem, thi det er den store Konges Stad.
 36.  Du må heller ikke sværge ved dit Hoved, thi du kan ikke gøre et
      eneste Hår hvidt eller sort.
 37.  Men eders Tale skal være ja, ja, nej, nej; hvad der er ud over
      dette, er af det onde.

 38.  I have hørt, at der er sagt: Øje for Øje, og Tand for Tand.
 39.  Men jeg siger eder, at I må ikke sætte eder imod det onde; men
      dersom nogen giver dig et Slag på din højre Kind, da vend ham
      også den anden til!
 40.  Og dersom nogen vil gå i Rette med dig og tage din Kjortel, lad
      ham da også få Kappen!
 41.  Og dersom nogen tvinger dig til at gå een Mil,da gå to med ham!
 42.  Giv den, som beder dig, og vend dig ikke fra den, som vil låne
      af dig.

 43.  I have hørt, at der er sagt: Du skal elske din Næste og hade din
      Fjende.
 44.  Men jeg siger eder: Elsker eders Fjender, velsigner dem, som
      forbande eder, gører dem godt, som hade eder, og beder for dem,
      som krænke eder og forfølge eder,
 45.  for at I må vorde eders Faders Børn, han, som er i Himlene; thi
      han lader sin Sol opgå over onde og gode og lader det regne over
      retfærdige og uretfærdige.
 46.  Thi dersom I elske dem, som elske eder, hvad Løn have I da? Gøre
      ikke også Tolderne det samme?
 47.  Og dersom I hilse eders Brødre alene, hvad stort gøre I da? Gøre
      ikke også Hedningerne det samme?
 48.  Værer da I fuldkomne, ligesom eders himmelske Fader er
      fuldkommen.

Matt. 6

  1.  Vogter eder at i ikke øve eders Retfærdighed for Menneskene for
      at beskues af dem; ellers have I ikke Løn hos eders Fader, som
      er Himlene.
  2.  Derfor, når du giver Almisse, må du ikke lade blæse i Basun
      foran dig, som Hyklerne gøre i Synagogerne og på Gaderne, for at
      de kunne blive ærede af Menneskene; sandelig, siger jeg eder, de
      have allerede fået deres Løn.
  3.  Men når du giver Almisse, da lad din venstre Hånd ikke vide,
      hvad din højre gør,
  4.  for at din Almisse kan være i Løndom, og din Fader, som ser i
      Løndom, skal betale dig.

  5.  Og når I bede, skulle I ikke være som Hyklerne; thi de stå gerne
      i Synagogerne og på Gadehjørnerne og bede, for at de kunne vise
      sig for Menneskene; sandelig, siger jeg eder, de have allerede
      fået deres Løn.
  6.  Men du, når du beder, da gå ind i dit Kammer, og luk din Dør, og
      bed til din Fader, som er i Løndom, og din Fader, som ser i
      Løndom, skal betale dig.
  7.  Men når I bede, må I ikke bruge overflødige Ord som Hedningerne;
      thi de mene, at de skulle blive bønhørte for deres mange Ord.
  8.  Ligner derfor ikke dem; thi eders Fader ved, hvad I trænge til,
      førend I bede ham,
  9.  Derfor skulle I bede således: Vor Fader, du, som er i Himlene!
      Helliget vorde dit Navn;
 10.  komme dit Rige; ske din Villie, som i Himmelen således også på
      Jorden;
 11.  giv os i dag vort daglige Brød:
 12.  og forlad os vor Skyld, som også vi forlade vore Skyldnere;
 13.  og led os ikke i Fristelse; men fri os fra det onde; (thi dit er
      Riget og Magten og Æren i Evighed! Amen.)
 14.  Thi forlade I Menneskene deres Overtrædelser, vil eders
      himmelske Fader også forlade eder;
 15.  men forlade I ikke Menneskene deres Overtrædelser, vil eders
      Fader ikke heller forlade eders Overtrædelser.

 16.  Og når I faste, da ser ikke bedrøvede ud som Hyklerne; thi de
      gøre deres Ansigter ukendelige, for at de kunne vise sig for
      Menneskene som fastende; sandelig, siger jeg eder, de have
      allerede fået deres Løn.
 17.  Men du, når du faster, da salv dit Hoved, og to dit Ansigt,
 18.  for at du ikke skal vise dig for Menneskene som fastende, men
      for din Fader, som er i Løndom; og din Fader, som ser i Løndom,
      skal betale dig.

 19.  Samler eder ikke Skatte på Jorden, hvor Møl og Rust fortære, og
      hvor Tyve bryde ind og stjæle;
 20.  men samler eder Skatte i Himmelen, hvor hverken Møl eller Rust
      fortære, og hvor Tyve ikke bryde ind og stjæle.
 21.  Thi hvor din Skat er, der vil også dit Hjerte være.
 22.  Øjet er Legemets Lys; derfor, dersom dit Øje er sundt, bliver
      hele dit Legeme lyst;
 23.  men dersom dit Øje er dårligt, bliver hele dit Legeme mørkt.
      Dersom nu det Lys, der er i dig, er Mørke, hvor stort bliver da
      ikke Mørket!
 24.  Ingen kan tjene to Herrer; thi han må enten hade den ene og
      elske den anden eller holde sig til den ene og ringeagte den
      anden. I kunne ikke tjene Gud og Mammon.

 25.  Derfor siger jeg eder: Bekymrer eder ikke for eders Liv, hvad I
      skulle spise, eller hvad I skulle drikke; ikke heller for eders
      Legeme, hvad I skulle iføre eder. Er ikke Livet mere end Maden,
      og Legemet mere end Klæderne?
 26.  Ser på Himmelens Fugle; de så ikke og høste ikke og sanke ikke i
      Lader, og eders himmelske Fader føder dem; ere I ikke meget mere
      værd end de?
 27.  Og hvem af eder kan ved at bekymre sig lægge een Alen til sin
      Vækst?
 28.  Og hvorfor bekymre I eder for Klæder? Betragter Lillierne på
      Marken, hvorledes de vokse; de arbejde ikke og spinde ikke;
 29.  men jeg siger eder, at end ikke Salomon i al sin Herlighed var
      klædt som en af dem.
 30.  Klæder da Gud således det Græs på Marken, som står i dag og i
      Morgen kastes i Ovnen, skulde han da ikke meget mere klæde eder,
      I lidettroende?
 31.  Derfor må I ikke bekymre eder og sige: Hvad skulle vi spise?
      eller: Hvad skulle vi drikke? eller: Hvormed skulle vi klæde os?
 32.  - efter alt dette søge jo Hedningerne -. Thi eders himmelske
      Fader ved, at I have alle disse Ting nødig.
 33.  Men søger først Guds Rige og hans Retfærdighed, så skulle alle
      disse Ting gives eder i Tilgift.
 34.  Bekymrer eder derfor ikke for den Dag i Morgen; thi den Dag i
      Morgen skal bekymre sig for sig selv. Hver Dag har nok i sin
      Plage.

Matt. 7

  1.  Dømmer ikke,for at I ikke skulle dømmes; thi med hvad Dom I
      dømme, skulle I dømmes,
  2.  og med hvad Mål I måle, skal der tilmåles eder.
  3.  Men hvorfor ser du Skæven, som er i din Broders Øje, men Bjælken
      i dit eget Øje bliver du ikke var?
  4.  Eller hvorledes kan du sige til din Broder: Lad mig drage Skæven
      ud af dit Øje; og se, Bjælken er i dit eget Øje.
  5.  Du Hykler! drag først Bjælken ud af dit Øje, og da kan du se
      klart til at tage Skæven ud af din Broders Øje.

  6.  Giver ikke Hunde det hellige, kaster ikke heller eders Perler
      for Svin, for at de ikke skulle nedtræde dem med deres Fødder og
      vende sig og sønderrive eder.

  7.  Beder, så skal eder gives; søger, så skulle I finde; banker på,
      så skal der lukkes op for eder.
  8.  Thi hver den, som beder, han får, og den, som søger, han finder,
      og den, som banker på, for ham skal der lukkes op.
  9.  Eller hvilket Menneske er der iblandt eder, som, når hans Søn
      beder ham om Brød, vil give ham en Sten?
 10.  Eller når han beder ham om en Fisk, mon han da vil give ham en
      Slange?
 11.  Dersom da I, som ere onde, vide at give eders Børn gode Gaver,
      hvor meget mere skal eders Fader, som er i Himlene, give dem
      gode Gaver, som bede ham!

 12.  Altså, alt hvad I ville, at Menneskene skulle gøre imod eder,
      det skulle også I gøre imod dem; thi dette er Loven og
      Profeterne.

 13.  Går ind ad den snævre Port; thi den Port er vid, og den Vej er
      bred,som fører til Fortabelsen, og de ere mange, som gå ind ad
      den;
 14.  thi den Port er snæver, og den Vej er trang, som fører til Livet
      og de er få, som finde den

 15.  Men vogter eder for de falske Profeter, som komme til eder i
      Fåreklæder, men indvortes ere glubende Ulve.
 16.  Af deres Frugter skulle I kende dem. Sanker man vel Vindruer af
      Torne eller Figener af Tidsler?
 17.  Således bærer hvert godt Træ gode Frugter, men det rådne Træ
      bærer slette Frugter.
 18.  Et godt Træ kan ikke bære slette Frugter, og et råddent Træ kan
      ikke bære gode Frugter.
 19.  Hvert Træ, som ikke bærer god Frugt, omhugges og kastes i Ilden.
 20.  Altså skulle I kende dem af deres Frugter.
 21.  Ikke enhver, som siger til mig: Herre, Herre! skal komme ind i
      Himmeriges Rige, men den, der gør min Faders Villie, som er i
      Himlene.
 22.  Mange skulle sige til mig på hin Dag: Herre, Herre! have vi ikke
      profeteret ved dit Navn, og have vi ikke uddrevet onde Ånder ved
      dit Navn, og have vi ikke gjort mange kraftige Gerninger ved dit
      Navn?
 23.  Og da vil jeg bekende for dem Jeg kendte eder aldrig; viger bort
      fra mig, I, som øve Uret!

 24.  Derfor, hver den, som hører disse mine Ord og gør efter dem, ham
      vil jeg ligne ved en forstandig Mand, som byggede sit Hus på
      Klippen,
 25.  og Skylregnen faldt, og Floderne kom, og Vindene blæste og sloge
      imod dette Hus, og det faldt ikke; thi det var grundfæstet på
      Klippen.
 26.  Og hver den, som hører disse mine Ord og ikke gør efter dem,
      skal lignes ved en Dåre, som byggede sit Hus på Sandet,
 27.  og Skylregnen faldt, og Floderne kom, og Vindene blæste og
      stødte imod dette Hus, og det faldt, og dets Fald var stort."

 28.  Og det skete, da Jesus havde fuldendt disse Ord, vare Skarerne
      slagne af Forundring over hans Lære;
 29.  thi han lærte dem som en, der havde Myndighed, og ikke som deres
      skriftkloge.

Matt. 8

  1.  Men da han var gået ned ad Bjerget, fulgte store Skarer ham.
  2.  Og se, en spedalsk kom, faldt ned for ham og sagde: "Herre! om
      du vil, så kan du rense mig."
  3.  Og han udrakte Hånden, rørte ved ham og sagde: "Jeg vil; bliv
      ren!" Og straks blev han renset for sin Spedalskhed
  4.  Og Jesus siger til ham: "Se til, at du ikke siger det til nogen;
      men gå hen, fremstil dig selv for Præsten, og offer den Gave,
      som Moses har befalet, til Vidnesbyrd for dem."

  5.  Men da han gik ind i Kapernaum, trådte en Høvedsmand hen til
      ham, bad ham og sagde:
  6.  "Herre! min Dreng ligger hjemme værkbruden og, pines svarlig."
  7.  Jesus siger til ham: "Jeg vil komme og helbrede ham."
  8.  Og Høvedsmanden svarede og sagde: "Herre! jeg er ikke værdig
      til, at du skal gå ind under mit Tag; men sig det blot med et
      Ord, så bliver min Dreng helbredt.
  9.  Jeg er jo selv et Menneske, som står under Øvrighed og har
      Stridsmænd under mig; og siger jeg til den ene: Gå! så går han;
      og til den anden: Kom! så kommer han; og til min Tjener: Gør
      dette! så gør han det."
 10.  Men da Jesus hørte det, forundrede han sig og sagde til dem, som
      fulgte ham: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, end ikke i Israel har jeg
      fundet så stor en Tro.
 11.  Men jeg siger eder, at mange skulle komme fra Øster og Vester og
      sidde til Bords med Abraham og Isak og Jakob i Himmeriges Rige.
 12.  Men Rigets Børn skulle kastes ud i Mørket udenfor; der skal der
      være Gråd og Tænders Gnidsel."
 13.  Og Jesus sagde til Høvedsmanden:"Gå bort,dig ske, som du
      troede!"  Og Drengen blev helbredt i den samme Time.

 14.  Og Jesus kom ind i Peters Hus og så, at hans Svigermoder lå og
      havde Feber.
 15.  Og han rørte ved hendes Hånd, og Feberen forlod hende, og hun
      stod op og vartede ham op.
 16.  Men da det var blevet Aften, førte de mange besatte til ham, og
      han uddrev Ånderne med et Ord og helbredte alle de syge;
 17.  for at det skulde opfyldes, som er talt ved Profeten Esajas, der
      siger: "Han tog vore Skrøbeligheder og bar vore Sygdomme."

 18.  Men da Jesus så store Skarer omkring sig, befalede han at fare
      over til hin Side.
 19.  Og der kom een, en skriftklog, og sagde til ham: "Mester! jeg
      vil følge dig, hvor du end går hen."
 20.  Og Jesus siger til ham: "Ræve have Huler, og Himmelens Fugle
      Reder; men Menneskesønnen har ikke det, hvortil han kan hælde
      sit Hoved."
 21.  Men en anden af disciplene sagde til ham: "Herre! tilsted mig
      først at gå hen og begrave min Fader."
 22.  Men Jesus siger til ham: "Følg mig, og lad de døde begrave deres
      døde!"

 23.  Og da han gik om Bord i Skibet, fulgte hans Disciple ham.
 24.  Og se, det blev en stærk Storm på Søen, så at Skibet skjultes af
      Bølgerne; men han sov.
 25.  Og de gik hen til ham, vækkede ham og sagde: "Herre, frels os!
      vi forgå."
 26.  Og han siger til dem: "Hvorfor ere I bange, I lidettroende?" Da
      stod han op og truede Vindene og Søen,og det blev ganske
      blikstille.
 27.  Men Menneskene forundrede sig og sagde: "Hvem er dog denne,
      siden både Vindene og Søen ere ham lydige?"

 28.  Og da han kom over til hin Side til Gadarenernes Land, mødte ham
      to besatte, som kom ud fra Gravene, og de vare såre vilde, så at
      ingen kunde komme forbi ad den Vej.
 29.  Og se, de råbte og sagde: "Hvad have vi med dig at gøre, du Guds
      Søn? Er du kommen hid før Tiden for at pine os?"
 30.  Men der var langt fra dem en stor Hjord Svin, som græssede.
 31.  Og de onde Ånder bade ham og sagde: "Dersom du uddriver os, da
      send os i Svinehjorden!"
 32.  Og han sagde til dem: "Går!" Men de fore ud og fore i Svinene;
      og se, hele Hjorden styrtede sig ned over Brinken ud i Søen og
      døde i Vandet.
 33.  Men Hyrderne flyede og gik hen i Byen og fortalte det alt
      sammen, og hvorledes det var gået til med de besatte.
 34.  Og se, hele Byen gik ud for at møde Jesus; og da de så ham, bade
      de ham om; at han vilde gå bort fra deres Egn.

Matt. 9

  1.  Og han gik om Bord i et Skib og for over og kom til sin egen By.
  2.  Og se, de bare til ham en værkbruden, som lå på en Seng; og da
      Jesus så deres Tro, sagde han til den værkbrudne: "Søn! vær
      frimodig, dine Synder forlades dig."
  3.  Og se, nogle af de skriftkloge sagde ved sig selv: "Denne taler
      bespotteligt."
  4.  Og da Jesus så deres Tanker, sagde han: "Hvorfor tænke I ondt i
      eders Hjerter?
  5.  Thi hvilket er lettest at sige: Dine Synder forlades dig, eller
      at sige: Stå op og gå?
  6.  Men for at I skulle vide, at Menneskesønnen har Magt på Jorden
      til at forlade Synder," da siger han til den værkbrudne: "Stå
      op, og tag din Seng, og gå til dit Hus!"
  7.  Og han stod op og gik bort til sit Hus.
  8.  Men da Skarerne så det, frygtede de og priste Gud, som havde
      givet Menneskene en sådan Magt.

  9.  Og da Jesus gik videre derfra, så han en Mand, som hed Matthæus,
      sidde ved Toldboden; og han siger til ham: "Følg mig!" Og han
      stod op og fulgte ham.
 10.  Og det skete, da han sad til Bords i Huset, se, da kom der mange
      Toldere og Syndere og sade til Bords med Jesus og hans Disciple.
 11.  Og da Farisæerne så det, sagde de til hans Disciple: "Hvorfor
      spiser eders Mester med Toldere og Syndere?"
 12.  Men da Jesus hørte det, sagde han: "De raske trænge ikke til
      Læge, men de syge.
 13.  Men går hen og lærer, hvad det vil sige: Jeg har Lyst til
      Barmhjertighed og ikke til Offer; thi jeg er ikke kommen for at
      kalde retfærdige, men Syndere,"

 14.  Da komme Johannes's Disciple til ham og sige: "Hvorfor faste vi
      og Farisæerne meget, men dine Disciple faste ikke?"
 15.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "Kunne Brudesvendene sørge, så længe
      Brudgommen er hos dem? Men der skal komme Dage, da Brudgommen
      bliver tagen fra dem, og da skulle de faste.
 16.  Men ingen sætter en Lap af uvalket Klæde på et gammelt Klædebon;
      thi Lappen river Klædebonnet itu, og der bliver et værre Hul.
 17.  Man kommer heller ikke ung Vin på gamle Læderflasker, ellers
      sprænges Læderflaskerne, og Vinen spildes, og Læderflaskerne
      ødelægges; men man kommer ung Vin på nye Læderflasker, så blive
      begge Dele bevarede."

 18.  Medens han talte dette til dem, se, da kom der en Forstander og
      faldt ned for ham og sagde: "Min Datter er lige nu død; men kom
      og læg din Hånd på hende, så bliver hun levende."
 19.  Og Jesus stod op og fulgte ham med sine Disciple.
 20.  Og se, en Kvinde, som havde haft Blodflod i tolv År, trådte hen
      bagfra og rørte ved Fligen af hans Klædebon;
 21.  thi hun sagde ved sig selv: "Dersom jeg blot rører ved hans
      Klædebon, bliver jeg frelst."
 22.  Men Jesus vendte sig om, og da han så hende, sagde han: "Datter!
      vær frimodig, din Tro har frelst dig." Og Kvinden blev frelst
      fra den samme Time.
 23.  Og da Jesus kom til Forstanderens Hus og så Fløjtespillerne og
      Hoben, som larmede, sagde han:
 24.  "Gå bort, thi Pigen er ikke død, men hun sover." Og de lo ad
      ham.
 25.  Men da Hoben var dreven ud, gik han ind og tog hende ved Hånden;
      og Pigen stod op.
 26.  Og Rygtet herom kom ud i hele den Egn.

 27.  Og da Jesus gik bort derfra, fulgte der ham to blinde, som råbte
      og sagde: "Forbarm dig over os, du Davids Søn!"
 28.  Men da han kom ind i Huset, gik de blinde til ham; og Jesus
      siger til dem: "Tro I, at jeg kan gøre dette?"De siger til
      ham:"Ja,Herre!"
 29.  Da rørte han ved deres Øjne og sagde: "Det ske eder efter eders
      Tro!"
 30.  Og deres Øjne bleve åbnede. Og Jesus bød dem strengt og sagde:
      "Ser til, lad ingen få det at vide."
 31.  Men de gik ud og udbredte Rygtet om ham i hele den Egn.
 32.  Men da disse gik ud, se, da førte de til ham et stumt Menneske,
      som var besat.
 33.  Og da den onde Ånd var uddreven, talte den stumme. Og Skarerne
      forundrede sig og sagde: "Aldrig er sådant set i Israel."
 34.  Men Farisæerne sagde: "Ved de onde Ånders Fyrste uddriver han de
      onde Ånder."

 35.  Og Jesus gik omkring i alle Byerne og Landsbyerne, lærte i deres
      Synagoger og prædikede Rigets Evangelium og helbredte enhver
      Sygdom og enhver Skrøbelighed.
 36.  Men da han så Skarerne, ynkedes han inderligt over dem; thi de
      vare vanrøgtede og forkomne som Får, der ikke have Hyrde.
 37.  Da siger han til sine Disciple: "Høsten er stor, men Arbejderne
      ere få;
 38.  beder derfor Høstens Herre om, at han vil sende Arbejdere ud til
      sin Høst."

Matt. 10

  1.  Og han kaldte sine tolv Disciple til sig og gav dem Magt over
      urene Ånder, til at uddrive dem og at helbrede enhver Sygdom og
      enhver Skrøbelighed.
  2.  Og disse ere de tolv Apostles Navne: Først Simon, som kaldes
      Peter, og Andreas, hans Broder, og Jakob, Zebedæus's Søn, og
      Johannes, hans Broder,
  3.  Filip og Bartholomæus, Thomas og Tolderen Matthæus, Jakob,
      Alfæus's Søn, og Lebbæus med Tilnavn Thaddæus,
  4.  Simon Kananæeren og Judas Iskariot, han, som forrådte ham.

  5.  Disse tolv udsendte Jesus, bød dem og sagde: "Går ikke hen på
      Hedningers Vej, og går ikke ind i Samaritaners By!
  6.  Men går hellere hen til de fortabte Får af Israels Hus!
  7.  Men på eders Vandring skulle I prædike og sige: Himmeriges Rige
      er kommet nær.
  8.  Helbreder syge, opvækker døde, renser spedalske, uddriver onde
      Ånder! I have modtaget det for intet, giver det for intet!
  9.  Skaffer eder ikke Guld, ej heller Sølv, ej heller Kobber i eders
      Bælter;
 10.  ej Taske til at rejse med, ej heller to Kjortler, ej heller Sko,
      ej heller Stav; thi Arbejderen er sin Føde værd.
 11.  Men hvor I komme ind i en By eller Landsby, der skulle I spørge,
      hvem i den der er det værd, og der skulle I blive, indtil I
      drage bort.
 12.  Men når I gå ind i Huset, da hilser det;
 13.  og dersom Huset er det værd, da komme eders Fred over det; men
      dersom det ikke er det værd, da vende eders Fred tilbage til
      eder!
 14.  Og dersom nogen ikke modtager eder og ej hører eders Ord, da går
      ud af det Hus eller den By og ryster Støvet af eders Fødder!
 15.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, det skal gå Sodomas og Gomorras Land
      tåleligere på Dommens Dag end den By.

 16.  Se, jeg sender eder som Får midt iblandt Ulve; vorder derfor
      snilde som Slanger og enfoldige som Duer!
 17.  Vogter eder for Menneskene; thi de skulle overgive eder til
      Rådsforsamlinger og hudstryge eder i deres Synagoger.
 18.  Og I skulle føres for Landshøvdinger og Konger for min Skyld,
      dem og Hedningerne til et Vidnesbyrd.
 19.  Men når de overgive eder, da bekymrer eder ikke for, hvorledes
      eller hvad I skulle tale; thi det skal gives eder i den samme
      Time, hvad I skulle tale.
 20.  Thi I ere ikke de, som tale; men det er eders Faders Ånd, som
      taler i eder.
 21.  Men Broder skal overgive Broder til Døden, og Fader sit Barn, og
      Børn skulle sætte sig op imod Forældre og slå dem ihjel.
 22.  Og I skulle hades af alle for mit Navns Skyld; men den, som
      holder ud indtil Enden, han skal blive frelst.
 23.  Men når de forfølge eder i een By, da flyr til en anden; thi
      sandelig, siger jeg eder, I skulle ikke komme til Ende med
      Israels Byer, førend Menneskesønnen kommer.
 24.  En Discipel er ikke over sin Mester, ej heller en Tjener over
      sin Herre.
 25.  Det er Disciplen nok, at han bliver som sin Mester, og Tjeneren
      som sin Herre. Have de kaldt Husbonden Beelzebul, hvor meget
      mere da hans Husfolk?

 26.  Frygter altså ikke for dem; thi intet er skjult, som jo skal
      åbenbares, og intet er lønligt, som jo skal blive kendt.
 27.  Taler i Lyset, hvad jeg siger eder i Mørket; og prædiker på
      Tagene, hvad der siges eder i Øret!
 28.  Og frygter ikke for dem, som slå Legemet ihjel, men ikke kunne
      slå Sjælen ihjel; men frygter hellere for ham, som kan fordærve
      både Sjæl og Legeme i Helvede.
 29.  Sælges ikke to Spurve for en Penning? Og ikke een af dem falder
      til Jorden uden eders Faders Villie.
 30.  Men på eder ere endog alle Hovedhår talte.
 31.  Frygter derfor ikke; I ere mere værd end mange Spurve.
 32.  Altså, enhver som vedkender sig mig for Menneskene, ham vil også
      jeg vedkende mig for min Fader, som er i Himlene.
 33.  Men den, som fornægter mig for Menneskene, ham vil også jeg
      fornægte for min Fader, som er i Himlene.

 34.  Mener ikke, at jeg er kommen for at bringe Fred på Jorden; jeg
      er ikke kommen for at bringe Fred, men Sværd.
 35.  Thi jeg er kommen før at volde Splid imellem en Mand og hans
      Fader og imellem en Datter og hendes Moder og imellem en
      Svigerdatter og hendes Svigermoder,
 36.  og en Mands Husfolk skulle være hans Fjender.
 37.  Den, som elsker Fader eller Moder mere end mig, er mig ikke
      værd; og den, som elsker Søn eller Datter mere end mig, er mig
      ikke værd;
 38.  og den, som ikke tager sit Kors og følger efter mig, er mig ikke
      værd.
 39.  Den, som bjærger sit Liv, skal miste det; og den, som mister sit
      Liv for min Skyld, skal bjærge det.

 40.  Den, som modtager eder, modtager mig; og den, som modtager mig,
      modtager ham, som udsendte mig.
 41.  Den, som modtager en Profet, fordi han er en Profet, skal få en
      Profets Løn; og den, som modtager en retfærdig, fordi han er en
      retfærdig, skal få en retfærdigs Løn.
 42.  Og den, som giver en af disse små ikkun et Bæger koldt Vand at
      drikke, fordi han er en Discipel, sandelig, siger jeg eder, han
      skal ingenlunde miste sin Løn."

Matt. 11

  1.  Og det skete, da Jesus var færdig med at give sine tolv Disciple
      Befaling, gik han videre derfra for at lære og prædike i deres
      Byer.
  2.  Men da Johannes hørte i Fængselet om Kristi Gerninger, sendte
      han Bud med sine Disciple og lod ham sige:
  3.  "Er du den, som kommer, eller skulle vi vente en anden?"
  4.  Og Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Går hen, og forkynder
      Johannes de Ting, som I høre og se:
  5.  blinde se, og lamme gå, spedalske renses, og døve høre, og døde
      stå op, og Evangeliet forkyndes for fattige;
  6.  og salig er den, som ikke forarges på mig."
  7.  Men da disse gik bort, begyndte Jesus at sige til Skarerne om
      Johannes: "Hvad gik I ud i Ørkenen at skue? Et Rør, som bevæges
      hid og did af Vinden?
  8.  Eller hvad gik I ud at se? Et Menneske, iført bløde Klæder? Se,
      de, som bære bløde Klæder, ere i Kongernes Huse.
  9.  Eller hvad gik I ud at se? En Profet? Ja, siger jeg eder, endog
      mere end en Profet.
 10.  Thi han er den, om hvem der er skrevet: Se,jeg sender min Engel
      for dit Ansigt, han skal berede din Vej foran dig.
 11.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, iblandt dem, som ere fødte af Kvinder,
      er ingen større fremstået end Johannes Døberen; men den mindste
      i Himmeriges Rige er større end han.
 12.  Men fra Johannes Døberens Dage indtil nu tages Himmeriges Rige
      med Vold, og Voldsmænd rive det til sig.
 13.  Thi alle Profeterne og Loven have profeteret indtil Johannes.
 14.  Og dersom I ville tage imod det: Han er Elias, som skal komme.
 15.  Den, som har Øren at høre med, han høre!

 16.  Men hvem skal jeg ligne denne Slægt ved? Den ligner Børn, som
      sidde på Torvene og råbe til de andre og sige:
 17.  Vi blæste på Fløjte for eder, og I dansede ikke; vi sang
      Klagesange, og I jamrede ikke.
 18.  Thi Johannes kom, som hverken spiste eller drak, og de sige: Han
      er besat.
 19.  Menneskesønnen kom, som spiser og drikker, og de sige: Se, en
      Frådser og en Vindranker, Tolderes og Synderes Ven! Dog,
      Visdommen er retfærdiggjort ved sine Børn."

 20.  Da begyndte han at skamme de Byer ud, i hvilke hans fleste
      kraftige Gerninger vare gjorte, fordi de ikke havde omvendt sig:
 21.  "Ve dig, Korazin! ve dig, Bethsajda! thi dersom de kraftige
      Gerninger, som ere skete i eder, vare skete i Tyrus og Sidon, da
      havde de for længe siden omvendt sig i Sæk og Aske.
 22.  Men jeg siger eder: Det skal gå Tyrus og Sidon tåleligere på
      Dommens Dag end eder.
 23.  Og du, Kapernaum! som er bleven ophøjet indtil Himmelen, du skal
      nedstødes indtil Dødsriget; thi dersom de kraftige Gerninger,
      som ere skete i dig, vare skete i Sodoma, da var den bleven
      stående indtil denne Dag.
 24.  Men jeg siger eder: Det skal gå Sodomas Land tåleligere på
      Dommens Dag end dig."

 25.  På den Tid udbrød Jesus og sagde: "Jeg priser dig, Fader,
      Himmelens og Jordens Herre! fordi du har skjult dette for vise
      og forstandige og åbenbaret det for umyndige.
 26.  Ja, Fader! thi således skete det, som var velbehageligt for dig.
 27.  Alle Ting ere mig overgivne af min Fader; og ingen kender Sønnen
      uden Faderen, og ingen kender Faderen uden Sønnen, og den, for
      hvem Sønnen vil åbenbare ham.

 28.  Kommer hid til mig alle, som lide Møje og ere besværede, og jeg
      vil give eder Hvile.
 29.  Tager mit Åg på eder, og lærer af mig; thi jeg er sagtmodig og
      ydmyg af Hjertet; så skulle I finde Hvile for eders Sjæle. 30
      Thi mit Åg er gavnligt, og min Byrde er let."

Matt. 12

  1.  På den Tid vandrede Jesus på Sabbaten igennem en Sædemark; men
      hans Disciple bleve hungrige og begyndte at plukke Aks og at
      spise.
  2.  Men da Farisæerne så det, sagde de til ham: "Se, dine Disciple
      gøre, hvad det ikke er tilladt at gøre på en Sabbat."
  3.  Men han sagde til dem: "Have I ikke læst, hvad David gjorde, da
      han blev hungrig og de, som vare med ham?
  4.  hvorledes han gik ind i Guds Hus og spiste Skuebrødene, som det
      ikke var ham tilladt at spise, ej heller dem, som vare med ham,
      men alene Præsterne?
  5.  Eller have I ikke læst i Loven, at på Sabbaterne vanhellige
      Præsterne Sabbaten i Helligdommen og ere dog uden Skyld?
  6.  Men jeg siger eder, at her er det, som er større end
      Helligdommen.
  7.  Men dersom I havde vidst, hvad det Ord betyder: Jeg har Lyst til
      Barmhjertighed og ikke til Offer, da havde I ikke fordømt dem,
      som ere uden Skyld.
  8.  Thi Menneskesønnen er Herre over Sabbaten."

  9.  Og han gik videre derfra og kom ind i deres Synagoge.
 10.  Og se, der var en Mand, som havde en vissen Hånd; og de spurgte
      ham ad og sagde: "Er det tilladt at helbrede på Sabbaten?" for
      at de kunde anklage ham.
 11.  Men han sagde til dem: "Hvilket Menneske er der iblandt eder,
      som har kun eet Får, og ikke tager fat på det og drager det op,
      dersom det på Sabbaten falder i en Grav?
 12.  Hvor meget er nu ikke et Menneske mere end et Får? Altså er det
      tilladt at gøre vel på Sabbaten."
 13.  Da siger han til Manden: "Ræk din Hånd ud!" og han rakte den ud,
      og den blev igen sund som den anden.
 14.  Men Farisæerne gik ud og lagde Råd op imod ham, hvorledes de
      kunde slå ham ihjel.

 15.  Men da Jesus mærkede det, drog han bort derfra; og mange fulgte
      ham, og han helbredte dem alle.
 16.  Og han bød dem strengt, at de ikke måtte gøre ham kendt;
 17.  for at det skulde opfyldes, som er talt ved Profeten Esajas, som
      siger:
 18.  "Se, min Tjener, som jeg har udvalgt, min elskede, i hvem min
      Sjæl har Velbehag; jeg vil give min Ånd over ham, og han skal
      forkynde Hedningerne Ret.
 19.  Han skal ikke kives og ikke råbe, og ingen skal høre hans Røst
      på Gaderne.
 20.  Han skal ikke sønderbryde det knækkede Rør og ikke udslukke den
      rygende Tande, indtil han får ført Retten frem til Sejr.
 21.  Og på hans Navn skulle Hedninger håbe."

 22.  Da blev en besat, som var blind og stum, ført til ham; og han
      helbredte ham, så at den stumme talte og så.
 23.  Og alle Skarerne forfærdedes og sagde: "Mon denne skulde være
      Davids Søn?"
 24.  Men da Farisæerne hørte det, sagde de: "Denne uddriver ikke de
      onde Ånder uden ved Beelzebul, de onde Ånders Fyrste."
 25.  Men såsom han kendte deres Tanker, sagde han til dem: "Hvert
      Rige, som er kommet i Splid med sig selv, lægges øde; og hver By
      eller Hus, som er kommet i Splid med sig selv, kan ikke bestå.
 26.  Og hvis Satan uddriver Satan, så er han kommen i Splid med sig
      selv; hvorledes skal da hans Rige bestå?
 27.  Og dersom jeg uddriver de onde Ånder ved Beelzebul, ved hvem
      uddrive da eders Sønner dem? Derfor skulle de være eders
      Dommere.
 28.  Men dersom jeg uddriver de onde Ånder ved Guds Ånd, da er jo
      Guds Rige kommet til eder.
 29.  Eller hvorledes kan nogen gå ind i den stærkes Hus og røve hans
      Ejendele, uden han først binder den stærke? Da kan han plyndre
      hans Hus.
 30.  Den, som ikke er med mig, er imod mig; og den, som ikke samler
      med mig, adspreder.

 31.  Derfor siger jeg eder: Al Synd og Bespottelse skal forlades
      Menneskene, men Bespottelsen imod Ånden skal ikke forlades.
 32.  Og den, som taler et Ord imod Menneskesønnen, ham skal det
      forlades; men den som taler imod den Helligånd, ham skal det
      ikke forlades, hverken i denne Verden eller i den kommende.
 33.  Lader enten Træet være godt og dets Frugt god; eller lader Træet
      være råddent, og dets Frugt rådden; thi Træet kendes på Frugten.
 34.  I Øgleunger! hvorledes kunne I tale godt, når I ere onde? Thi af
      Hjertets Overflødighed taler Munden.
 35.  Et godt Menneske fremtager gode Ting af sit gode Forråd; og et
      ondt Menneske fremtager onde Ting af sit onde Forråd.
 36.  Men jeg siger eder, at Menneskene skulle gøre Regnskab på
      Dommens Dag for hvert utilbørligt Ord, som de tale.
 37.  Thi af dine Ord skal du retfærdiggøres, og af dine Ord skal du
      førdømmes."

 38.  Da svarede nogle af de skriftkloge og Farisæerne ham og sagde:
      "Mester! vi ønske at se et Tegn at dig."
 39.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "En ond og utro Slægt
      forlanger Tegn, men der skal intet Tegn gives den uden Profeten
      Jonas's Tegn.
 40.  Thi ligesom Jonas var tre Dage og tre Nætter i Havdyrets Bug,
      således skal Menneskesønnen være tre Dage og tre Nætter i
      Jordens Skød.
 41.  Mænd fra Ninive skulle opstå ved Dommen sammen med denne Slægt
      og fordømme den; thi de omvendte sig ved Jonas's Prædiken; og
      se, her er mere end Jonas.
 42.  Sydens Dronning skal oprejses ved Dommen sammen med denne Slægt
      og fordømme den; thi hun kom fra Jordens Grænser for at høre
      Salomons Visdom; og se, her er mere end Salomon.

 43.  Men når den urene Ånd er faren ud af Mennesket, vandrer den
      igennem vandløse Steder, søger Hvile og finder den ikke.
 44.  Da siger den: Jeg vil vende om til mit Hus, som jeg gik ud af;
      og når den kommer, finder den det ledigt, fejet og prydet.
 45.  Så går den hen og tager syv andre Ånder med sig, som ere værre
      end den selv, og når de ere komne derind, bo de der; og det
      sidste bliver værre med dette Menneske end det første. Således
      skal det også gå denne onde Slægt."

 46.  Medens han endnu talte til Skarerne, se, da stode hans Moder og
      hans Brødre udenfor og begærede at tale med ham.
 47.  Da sagde en til ham: "Se, din Moder og dine Brødre stå udenfor
      og begære at tale med dig."
 48.  Men han svarede og sagde til den, som sagde ham det: "Hvem er
      min Moder? og hvem ere mine Brødre?"
 49.  Og han rakte sin Hånd ud over sine Disciple og sagde: "Se, her
      er min Moder og mine Brødre!
 50.  Thi enhver, der gør min Faders Villie, som er i Himlene, han er
      min Broder og Søster og Moder."

Matt. 13

  1.  På hin dag gik Jesus ud af Huset og satte sig ved Søen.
  2.  Og store Skarer samlede sig om ham, så han gik om Bord i et Skib
      og satte sig; og hele Skaren stod på Strandbredden.
  3.  Og han talte meget til dem i Lignelser og sagde: "Se, en
      Sædemand gik ud at så.
  4.  Og idet han såede, faldt noget ved Vejen; og Fuglene kom og åde
      det op.
  5.  Og noget faldt på Stengrund, hvor det ikke havde megen Jord; og
      det voksede straks op, fordi det ikke havde dyb Jord.
  6.  Men da Solen kom op, blev det svedet af, og fordi det ikke havde
      Rod, visnede det.
  7.  Og noget faldt iblandt Torne; og Tornene voksede op og kvalte
      det.
  8.  Og noget faldt i god Jord og bar Frugt, noget hundrede, noget
      tresindstyve, noget tredive Fold.
  9.  Den, som har Øren, han høre!"

 10.  Og Disciplene gik hen og sagde til ham: "Hvorfor taler du til
      dem i Lignelser?"
 11.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Fordi det er eder givet at
      kende Himmeriges Riges Hemmeligheder; men dem er det ikke givet.
 12.  Thi den, som har, ham skal der gives, og han skal få Overflod;
      men den, som ikke har, fra ham skal endog det tages, som han
      har.
 13.  Derfor taler jeg til dem i Lignelser, fordi de skønt seende dog
      ikke se, og hørende dog ikke høre og forstå ikke heller.
 14.  Og på dem opfyldes Esajas's Profeti, som siger: Med eders Øren
      skulle I høre og dog ikke forstå og se med eders Øjne og dog
      ikke se.
 15.  Thi dette Folks Hjerte er blevet sløvet, og med Ørene høre de
      tungt, og deres Øjne have de tillukket, for at de ikke skulle se
      med Øjnene og høre med Ørene og forstå med Hjertet og omvende
      sig, på jeg kunde helbrede dem.
 16.  Men salige ere eders Øjne, fordi de se, og eders Øren, fordi de
      høre.
 17.  Thi sandelig, siger jeg eder, mange Profeter og retfærdige
      attråede at se, hvad I se, og så det ikke; og at høre, hvad I
      høre, og hørte det ikke.

 18.  Så hører nu I Lignelsen om Sædemanden!
 19.  Når nogen hører Rigets Ord og ikke forstår det, da kommer den
      Onde og river det bort, som er sået i hans Hjerte; denne er det,
      som blev sået ved Vejen.
 20.  Men det, som blev sået på Stengrund, er den, som hører Ordet og
      straks modtager det med Glæde.
 21.  Men han har ikke Rod i sig og holder kun ud til en Tid; men når
      der kommer Trængsel eller Forfølgelse for Ordets Skyld, forarges
      han straks.
 22.  Men det, som blev sået iblandt Torne, er den, som hører Ordet,
      og Verdens Bekymring og Rigdommens Forførelse kvæler Ordet, og
      det bliver uden Frugt.
 23.  Men det, som blev sået i god Jord, er den, som hører Ordet og
      forstår det, og som så bærer Frugt, en hundrede, en
      tresindstyve, en tredive Fold."

 24.  En anden Lignelse fremsatte han for dem og sagde: "Himmeriges
      Rige lignes ved et Menneske, som såede god Sæd i sin Mark.
 25.  Men medens Folkene sov, kom hans Fjende og såede Ugræs iblandt
      Hveden og gik bort.
 26.  Men da Sæden spirede frem og bar Frugt, da kom også Ugræsset til
      Syne.
 27.  Og Husbondens Tjenere kom til ham og sagde: Herre, såede du ikke
      god Sæd i din Mark? Hvor har den da fået Ugræsset fra?
 28.  Men han sagde til dem: Det har et fjendsk Menneske gjort. Da
      sige Tjenerne til ham: Vil du da, at vi skulle gå hen og sanke
      det sammen?
 29.  Men han siger: Nej, for at I ikke, når I sanke Ugræsset sammen,
      skulle rykke Hveden op tillige med det.
 30.  Lader dem begge vokse tilsammen indtil Høsten; og i Høstens Tid
      vil jeg sige til Høstfolkene: Sanker først Ugræsset sammen og
      binder det i Knipper for at brænde det, men samler Hveden i min
      Lade!"

 31.  En anden Lignelse fremsatte han for dem og sagde: "Himmeriges
      Rige ligner et Sennepskorn, som en Mand tog og såede i sin Mark.
 32.  Dette er vel mindre end alt andet Frø; men når det er vokset op,
      er det støre end Urterne og bliver et Træ, så at Himmelens Fugle
      komme og bygge Rede i dets Grene."

 33.  En anden Lignelse talte han til dem: "Himmeriges Rige ligner en
      Surdejg, som en Kvinde tog og lagde ned i tre Mål Mel, indtil
      det blev syret alt sammen."

 34.  Alt dette talte Jesus til Skarerne i Lignelser, og uden Lignelse
      talte han intet til dem,
 35.  for at det skulde opfyldes, som er talt ved Profeten, der siger:
      "Jeg vil oplade min Mund i Lignelser; jeg vil udsige det, som
      har været skjult fra Verdens Grundlæggelse."

 36.  Da forlod han Skarerne og gik ind i Huset; og hans Disciple kom
      til ham og sagde: "Forklar os Lignelsen om Ugræsset på Marken!"
 37.  Men han svarede og sagde: "Den, som sår den gode Sæd, er
      Menneskesønnen,
 38.  og Marken er Verden, og den gode Sæd er Rigets Børn, men
      Ugræsset er den Ondes Børn,
 39.  og Fjenden, som såede det, er Djævelen; og Høsten er Verdens
      Ende; og Høstfolkene ere Engle.
 40.  Ligesom nu Ugræsset sankes sammen og opbrændes med Ild, således
      skal det ske ved Verdens Ende.
 41.  Menneskesønnen skal udsende sine Engle, og de skulle sanke ud af
      hans Rige alle Forargelserne og dem, som gøre Uret;
 42.  og de skulle kaste dem i Ildovnen; der skal være Gråd og Tænders
      Gnidsel.
 43.  Da skulle de retfærdige skinne som Solen i deres Faders
      Rige. Den.  som har Øren, han høre!

 44.  Himmeriges Rige ligner en Skat. som er skjult i en Mark, og en
      Mand fandt og skjulte den, og af Glæde over den går han hen og
      sælger alt, hvad han har, og køber den Mark.

 45.  Atter ligner Himmeriges Rige en Købmand, som søgte efter skønne
      Perler;
 46.  og da han fandt een meget kostbar Perle, gik han hen og solgte
      alt, hvad han havde, og købte den.

 47.  Atter ligner Himmeriges Rige et Vod, som blev kastet i Havet og
      samlede Fisk af alle Slags.
 48.  Og da det var blevet fuldt, drog man det op på Strandbredden og
      satte sig og sankede de gode sammen i Kar, men kastede de rådne
      ud.
 49.  Således skal det gå til ved Verdens Ende. Englene skulle gå ud
      og skille de onde fra de retfærdige
 50.  og kaste dem i Ildovnen; der skal være Gråd og Tænders Gnidsel.
 51.  Have I forstået alt dette?" De sige til ham: "Ja."
 52.  Men han sagde til dem: "Derfor er hver skriftklog, som er oplært
      for Himmeriges Rige, ligesom en Husbond, der tager nyt og
      gammelt frem af sit Forråd."

 53.  Og det skete, da Jesus havde fuldendt disse Lignelser, drog han
      bort derfra.
 54.  Og han kom til sin Fædrene by og lærte dem i deres Synagoge, så
      at de bleve slagne af Forundring og sagde: "Hvorfra har han
      denne Visdom og de kraftige Gerninger?
 55.  Er denne ikke Tømmermandens Søn? Hedder ikke hans Moder Maria og
      hans Brødre Jakob og Josef og Simon og Judas?
 56.  Og hans Søstre, ere de ikke alle hos os? Hvorfra har han alt
      dette?"
 57.  Og de forargedes på ham. Men Jesus sagde til dem: "En Profet er
      ikke foragtet uden i sit eget Fædreland og i sit Hus,"
 58.  Og han gjorde ikke mange kraftige Gerninger der for deres
      Vantros Skyld.

Matt. 14

  1.  På den Tid hørte Fjerdingsfyrsten Herodes Rygtet om Jesus.
  2.  Og han sagde til sine Tjenere: "Det er Johannes Døberen; han er
      oprejst fra de døde, derfor virke Kræfterne i ham."
  3.  Thi Herodes havde grebet Johannes og bundet ham og sat ham i
      Fængsel for sin Broder Filips Hustru, Herodias's Skyld.
  4.  Johannes sagde nemlig til ham: "Det er dig ikke tilladt at have
      hende."
  5.  Og han vilde gerne slå ham ihjel, men frygtede for Mængden, thi
      de holdt ham for en Profet.
  6.  Men da Herodes's Fødselsdag kom, dansede Herodias's Datter for
      dem; og hun behagede Herodes.
  7.  Derfor lovede han med en Ed at give hende, hvad som helst hun
      begærede.
  8.  Og tilskyndet af sin Moder siger hun: "Giv mig Johannes Døberens
      Hoved hid på et Fad!"
  9.  Og Kongen blev bedrøvet; men for sine Eders og for Gæsternes
      Skyld befalede han, at det skulde gives hende.
 10.  Og han sendte Bud og lod Johannes halshugge i Fængselet.
 11.  Og hans Hoved blev bragt på et Fad og givet Pigen, og hun bragte
      det til sin Moder.
 12.  Da kom hans Disciple og toge Liget og begravede ham, og de kom
      og forkyndte Jesus det.

 13.  Og da Jesus hørte det, drog han bort derfra i et Skib til et øde
      Sted afsides; og da Skarerne hørte det, fulgte de ham til Fods
      fra Byerne.
 14.  Og da han kom i Land, så han en stor Skare, og han ynkedes
      inderligt over dem og helbredte deres syge.
 15.  Men da det blev Aften, kom Disciplene til ham og sagde: "Stedet
      er øde, og Tiden er allerede forløben; lad Skarerne gå bort, for
      at de kunne gå hen i Landsbyerne og købe sig Mad."
 16.  Men Jesus sagde til dem: "De have ikke nødig at gå bort; giver I
      dem at spise!"
 17.  Men de sige til ham: "Vi have ikke her uden fem Brød og to
      Fisk."
 18.  Men han sagde: "Henter mig dem hid!"
 19.  Og han bød Skarerne at sætte sig ned i Græsset og tog de fem
      Brød og de to Fisk, så op til Himmelen og velsignede; og han
      brød Brødene og gav Disciplene dem, og Disciplene gave dem til
      Skarerne.
 20.  Og de spiste alle og bleve mætte; og de opsamlede det, som blev
      tilovers af Stykkerne, tolv Kurve fulde
 21.  Men de, som spiste, vare omtrent fem Tusinde Mænd, foruden
      Kvinder og Børn.

 22.  Og straks nødte han sine Disciple til at gå om Bord i Skibet og
      i Forvejen sætte over til hin Side, medens han lod Skarerne gå
      bort.
 23.  Og da han havde ladet Skarerne gå bort, gik han op på Bjerget
      afsides for at bede. Og da det blev silde, var han der alene.
 24.  Men Skibet var allerede midt på Søen og led Nød af Bølgerne; thi
      Vinden var imod.
 25.  Men i den fjerde Nattevagt kom han til dem, vandrende på Søen.
 26.  Og da Disciplene så ham vandre på Søen, bleve de forfærdede og
      sagde: "Det er et Spøgelse;" og de skrege af Frygt.
 27.  Men straks talte Jesus til dem og sagde: "Værer frimodige; det
      er mig, frygter ikke!"
 28.  Men Peter svarede ham og sagde: "Herre! dersom det er dig, da
      byd mig at komme til dig på Vandet!"
 29.  Men han sagde: "Kom!" Og Peter trådte ned fra Skibet og vandrede
      på Vandet for at komme til Jesus.
 30.  Men da han så det stærke Vejr, blev han bange; og da han
      begyndte at synke, råbte han og sagde: "Herre, frels mig!"
 31.  Og straks udrakte Jesus Hånden og greb ham, og han siger til
      ham: "Du lidettroende, hvorfor tvivlede du?"
 32.  Og da de stege op i Skibet, lagde Vinden sig.
 33.  Men de, som vare i Skibet, faldt ned for ham og sagde: "Du er
      sandelig Guds Søn."
 34.  Og da de vare farne over, landede de i Genezareth.

 35.  Og da Folkene på det Sted kendte ham, sendte de Bud til hele
      Egnen der omkring og bragte alle de syge til ham.
 36.  Og de bade ham, at de blot måtte røre ved Fligen af hans
      Klædebon; og alle de, som rørte derved, bleve helbredede.

Matt. 15

  1.  Da kommer der fra Jerusalem Farisæere og skriftkloge til Jesus
      og sige:
  2.  "Hvorfor overtræde dine Disciple de gamles Overlevering? thi de
      to ikke deres Hænder, når de holde Måltid."
  3.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Hvorfor overtræde også I Guds
      Bud for eders Overleverings Skyld?
  4.  Thi Gud har påbudt og sagt: "Ær din Fader og Moder;" og: "Den,
      som hader Fader eller Moder, skal visselig dø."
  5.  Men I sige: "Den, som siger til sin Fader eller sin Moder: "Det,
      hvormed du skulde være hjulpet af mig, skal være en Tempelgave,"
      han skal ingenlunde ære sin Fader eller sin Moder."
  6.  Og I have ophævet Guds Lov for eders Overleverings Skyld.
  7.  I Hyklere! Rettelig profeterede Esajas om eder, da han sagde:
  8.  "Dette Folk ærer mig med Læberne; men deres Hjerte er langt
      borte fra mig.
  9.  Men de dyrke mig forgæves,idet de lære Lærdomme, som ere
      Menneskers Bud."
 10.  Og han kaldte Folkeskaren til sig og sagde til dem: "Hører og
      forstår!
 11.  Ikke det, som går ind i Munden, gør Mennesket urent, men det,
      som går ud af Munden, dette gør Mennesket urent."
 12.  Da kom hans Disciple hen og sagde til ham: "Ved du, at
      Farisæerne bleve forargede, da de hørte den Tale?"
 13.  Men han svarede og sagde: "Enhver Plantning, som min himmelske
      Fader ikke har plantet, skal oprykkes med Rode.
 14.  Lader dem fare, det er blinde Vejledere for blinde; men når en
      blind leder en blind, falde de begge i Graven."
 15.  Men Peter svarede og sagde til ham: "Forklar os Lignelsen!"
 16.  Og han sagde: "Ere også I endnu så uforstandige?
 17.  Forstår I endnu ikke, at alt, hvad der går ind i Munden, går i
      Bugen og føres ud ad den naturlige Vej?
 18.  Men det, som går ud af Munden, kommer ud fra Hjertet, og det gør
      Mennesket urent.
 19.  Thi ud fra Hjertet kommer der onde Tanker, Mord, Hor, Utugt,
      Tyverier, falske Vidnesbyrd, Forhånelser.
 20.  Det er disse Ting, som gøre Mennesket urent; men at spise med
      utoede Hænder gør ikke Mennesket urent."

 21.  Og Jesus gik bort derfra og drog til Tyrus's og Sidons Egne.
 22.  Og se, en kananæisk Kvinde kom fra disse Egne, råbte og sagde:
      "Herre, Davids Søn! forbarm dig over mig! min Datter plages ilde
      af en ond Ånd."
 23.  Men han svarede hende ikke et Ord. Da trådte hans Disciple til,
      bade ham og sagde: "Skil dig af med hende, thi hun råber efter
      os."
 24.  Men han svarede og sagde: "Jeg er ikke udsendt uden til de
      fortabte Får af Israels Hus."
 25.  Men hun kom og kastede sig ned for ham og sagde: "Herre, hjælp
      mig!"
 26.  Men han svarede og sagde: "Det er ikke smukt at tage Børnenes
      Brød og kaste det for de små Hunde."
 27.  Men hun sagde: "Jo, Herre! de små Hunde æde jo dog også af de
      Smuler, som falde fra deres Herrers Bord."
 28.  Da svarede Jesus og sagde til hende: "O Kvinde, din Tro er stor,
      dig ske, som du vil!" Og hendes Datter blev helbredt fra samme
      Time.

 29.  Og Jesus gik bort derfra og kom hen til Galilæas Sø, og han gik
      op på Bjerget og satte sig der.
 30.  Og store Skarer kom til ham og havde lamme, blinde, stumme,
      Krøblinge og mange andre med sig; og de lagde dem for hans
      Fødder, og han helbredte dem,
 31.  så at Skaren undrede sig, da de så, at stumme talte, Krøblinge
      bleve raske, lamme gik, og blinde så; og de priste Israels Gud.

 32.  Men Jesus kaldte sine Disciple til sig og sagde: "Jeg ynke s
      inderligt over Skaren; thi de have allerede tøvet hos mig tre
      Dage og have intet at spise; og lade dem gå fastende bort, vil
      jeg ikke, for at de ikke skulle vansmægte på Vejen."
 33.  Og hans Disciple sige til ham: "Hvorfra skulle vi få så mange
      Brød i en Ørken, at vi kunne mætte så mange Mennesker?"
 34.  Og Jesus siger til dem: "Hvor mange Brød have I?" Men de sagde:
      "Syv og nogle få Småfisk."
 35.  Og han bød Skaren at sætte sig ned på Jorden
 36.  og tog de syv Brød og Fiskene, takkede, brød dem og gav
      Disciplene dem, og Disciplene gave dem til Skarerne.
 37.  Og de spiste alle og bleve mætte; og de opsamlede det, som blev
      tilovers af Stykkerne, syv Kurve fulde.
 38.  Men de, som spiste, vare fire Tusinde Mænd, foruden Kvinder og
      Børn.
 39.  Og da han havde ladet Skarerne gå bort, gik han om Bord i Skibet
      og kom til Magadans Egne.

Matt. 16

  1.  Og Farisæerne og Saddukæerne kom hen og fristede ham og
      begærede, at han vilde vise dem et Tegn fra Himmelen.
  2.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Om Aftenen sige I: Det bliver
      en skøn Dag, thi Himmelen er rød;
  3.  og om Morgenen: Det bliver Storm i Dag, thi Himmelen er rød og
      mørk.  Om Himmelens Udseende vide I at dømme, men om Tidernes
      Tegn kunne I det, ikke.
  4.  En ond og utro Slægt forlanger Tegn; men der skal intet Tegn
      gives den uden Jonas's Tegn." Og han forlod dem og gik bort.

  5.  Og da hans Disciple kom over til hin Side, havde de glemt at
      tage Brød med.
  6.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "Ser til, og tager eder i Vare for
      Farisæernes og Saddukæernes Surdejg!"
  7.  Men de tænkte ved sig selv og sagde: "Det er, fordi vi ikke toge
      Brød med."
  8.  Men da Jesus mærkede dette, sagde han: "I lidettroende! hvorfor
      tænke I ved eder selv på, at I ikke have taget Brød med?
  9.  Forstå I ikke endnu? Komme I heller ikke i Hu de fem Brød til de
      fem Tusinde, og hvor mange Kurve I da toge op?
 10.  Ikke heller de syv Brød til de fire Tusinde, og hvor mange Kurve
      I da toge op?
 11.  Hvorledes forstå I da ikke, at det ej var om Brød, jeg sagde det
      til eder? Men tager eder i Vare for Farisæernes og Saddukæernes
      Surdejg."
 12.  Da forstode de, at han havde ikke sagt, at de skulde tage sig i
      Vare for Surdejgen i Brød, men for Farisæernes og Saddukæernes
      Lære.

 13.  Men da Jesus var kommen til Egnen ved Kæsarea Filippi, spurgte
      han sine Disciple og sagde: "Hvem sige Folk, at Menneskesønnen
      er?"
 14.  Men de sagde: "Nogle sige Johannes Døberen; andre Elias; andre
      Jeremias eller en af Profeterne."
 15.  Han siger til dem: "Men I, hvem sige I, at jeg er?"
 16.  Da svarede Simon Peter og sagde: "Du er Kristus, den levende
      Guds Søn."
 17.  Og Jesus svarede og sagde til ham: "Salig er du, Simon Jonas's
      Søn!  thi Kød og Blod har ikke åbenbaret dig det, men min Fader,
      som er i Himlene.
 18.  Så siger jeg også dig, at du er Petrus, og på denne Klippe vil
      jeg bygge min Menighed, og Dødsrigets Porte skulle ikke få
      Overhånd over den.
 19.  Og jeg vil give dig Himmeriges Riges Nøgler, og hvad du binder
      på Jorden, det skal være bundet i Himlene, og hvad du løser på
      Jorden, det skal være løst i Himlene."
 20.  Da bød han sine Disciple, at de måtte ikke sige til nogen at han
      var Kristus.

 21.  Fra den Tid begyndte Jesus at give sine Disciple til Kende, at
      han skulde gå til Jerusalem og lide meget af de Ældste og
      Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge og ihjelslås og oprejses på
      den tredje Dag.
 22.  Og Peter tog ham til Side, begyndte at sætte ham i Rette og
      sagde: "Gud bevare dig, Herre; dette skal ingenlunde ske dig!"
 23.  Men han vendte sig og sagde til Peter: "Vig bag mig, Satan! du
      er mig en Forargelse; thi du sanser ikke, hvad Guds er, men hvad
      Menneskers er."

 24.  Da sagde Jesus til sine Disciple: "Vil nogen komme efter mig,
      han fornægte sig selv og tage sit Kors op og følge mig!
 25.  Thi den, som vil frelse sit.Liv, skal miste det; men den, som
      mister sit Liv for min Skyld, skal bjærge det.
 26.  Thi hvad gavner det et Menneske, om han vinder den hele Verden,
      men må bøde med sin Sjæl? Eller hvad kan et Menneske give til
      Vederlag for sin Sjæl?
 27.  Thi Menneskesønnen skal komme i sin Faders Herlighed med sine
      Engle; og da skal han betale enhver efter hans Gerning.
 28.  Sandelig siger jeg eder, der er nogle af dem, som stå her, der
      ingenlunde skulle smage Døden, førend de se Menneskesønnen komme
      i sit Rige."

Matt. 17

  1.  Og seks Dage derefter tager Jesus Peter og Jakob og hans Broder
      Johannes med sig og fører dem afsides op på et højt Bjerg.
  2.  Og han blev forvandlet for deres Øjne, og hans Åsyn skinnede som
      Solen, men hans Klæder bleve hvide som Lyset.
  3.  Og se, Moses og Elias viste sig for dem og samtalede med ham.
  4.  Da tog Peter til Orde og sagde til Jesus: "Herre! det er godt,
      at vi ere her; vil du, da lader os gøre tre Hytter her, dig en
      og Moses en og Elias en."
  5.  Medens han endnu talte, se, da overskyggede en lysende Sky dem;
      og se, der kom fra Skyen en Røst. som sagde: "Denne er min
      Søn. den elskede, i hvem jeg har Velbehag; hører ham!"
  6.  Og da Disciplene hørte det, faldt de på deres Ansigt og frygtede
      såre.
  7.  Og Jesus trådte hen og rørte ved dem og sagde: "Står op, og
      frygter ikke!"
  8.  Men da de opløftede deres Øjne, så de ingen uden Jesus alene.
  9.  Og da de gik ned fra Bjerget, bød Jesus dem og sagde: "Taler
      ikke til nogen om dette Syn, førend Menneskesønnen er oprejst
      fra de døde."

 10.  Og hans Disciple spurgte ham og sagde: "Hvad er det da, de
      skriftkloge sige, at Elias bør først komme?"
 11.  Og han svarede og sagde: "Vel kommer Elias og skal genoprette
      alting.
 12.  Men jeg siger eder, at Elias er allerede kommen, og de erkendte
      ham ikke, men gjorde med ham alt, hvad de vilde; således skal
      også Menneskesønnen lide ondt af dem."
 13.  Da forstode Disciplene, at han havde talt til dem om Johannes
      Døberen.

 14.  Og da de kom til Folkeskaren, kom en Mand til ham og faldt på
      Knæ for ham og sagde:
 15.  "Herre! forbarm dig over min Søn, thi han er månesyg og lidende;
      thi han falder ofte i Ild og ofte i Vand;
 16.  og jeg bragte ham til dine Disciple, og de kunde ikke helbrede
      ham."
 17.  Og Jesus svarede og sagde: "O du vantro og forvendte Slægt! hvor
      længe skal jeg være hos eder, hvor længe skal jeg tåle eder?
      Bringer mig ham hid!"
 18.  Og Jesus talte ham hårdt til, og den onde Ånd for ud af ham, og
      Drengen blev helbredt fra samme Time.
 19.  Da gik Disciplene til Jesus afsides og sagde: "Hvorfor kunde vi
      ikke uddrive den?"
 20.  Og han siger til dem: "For eders Vantros Skyld; thi sandelig,
      siger jeg eder, dersom I have Tro som et Sennepskorn, da kunne I
      sige til dette Bjerg: Flyt dig herfra derhen, så skal det flytte
      sig, og intet skal være eder umuligt.
 21.  Men denne Slags farer ikke ud uden ved Bøn og Faste."

 22.  Og medens de vandrede sammen i Galilæa, sagde Jesus til dem:
      "Menneskesønnen skal overgives i Menneskers Hænder;
 23.  og de skulle slå ham ihjel, og på den tredje Dag skal han
      oprejses." Og de bleve såre bedrøvede.

 24.  Men da de kom til Kapernaum, kom de, som opkrævede
      Tempelskatten, til Peter og sagde: "Betaler eders Mester ikke
      Skatten?"
 25.  Han sagde: "Jo." Og da han kom ind i Huset, kom Jesus ham i
      Forkøbet og sagde: "Hvad tykkes dig, Simon? Af hvem tage Jordens
      Konger Told eller Skat, af deres egne Sønner eller af de
      fremmede?"
 26.  Og da han sagde: "Af de fremmede," sagde Jesus til ham: "Så ere
      jo Sønnerne fri.
 27.  Men for at vi ikke skulle forarge dem, så gå hen til Søen, kast
      en Krog ud, og tag den første Fisk, som kommer op; og når du
      åbner dens Mund, skal du finde en Stater; tag denne, og giv dem
      den for mig og dig!"

Matt. 18

  1.  I den samme Stund kom Disciplene hen til Jesus og sagde: "Hvem
      er da den største i Himmeriges Rige?"
  2.  Og han kaldte et lille Barn til sig og stillede det midt iblandt
      dem
  3.  og sagde: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, uden I omvende eder og
      blive som Børn, komme I ingenlunde ind i Himmeriges Rige.
  4.  Derfor, den, som fornedrer sig selv som dette Barn, han er den
      største i Himmeriges Rige.
  5.  Og den, som modtager et eneste sådant Barn for mit Navns Skyld,
      modtager mig.

  6.  Men den, som forarger een af disse små, som tro på mig, ham var
      det bedre, at der var hængt en Møllesten om hans Hals, og han
      var sænket i Havets Dyb.
  7.  Ve Verden for Forargelserne! Thi vel er det nødvendigt, at
      Forargelserne komme; dog ve det Menneske, ved hvem Forargelsen
      kommer!
  8.  Men dersom din Hånd eller din Fod forarger dig, da hug den af,
      og kast den fra dig! Det er bedre for dig at gå lam eller som en
      Krøbling ind til Livet end at have to Hænder og to Fødder og
      blive kastet i den evige Ild.
  9.  Og dersom dit Øje forarger dig, da riv det ud, og kast det fra
      dig!  Det er bedre for dig at gå enøjet ind til Livet end at
      have to Øjne og blive kastet i Helvedes Ild.

 10.  Ser til, at I ikke foragte en eneste af disse små; thi jeg siger
      eder: Deres Engle i Himlene se altid min Faders Ansigt, som er i
      Himlene.
 11.  Thi Menneskesønnen er kommen for at frelse det fortabte.
 12.  Hvad tykkes eder? Om et Menneske har hundrede Får, og eet af dem
      farer vild, forlader han da ikke de ni og halvfemsindstyve og
      går ud i Bjergene og leder efter det vildfarne?
 13.  Og hænder det sig, at han finder det, sandelig, siger jeg eder,
      han glæder sig mere over det end over de ni og halvfemsindstyve,
      som ikke ere farne vild.
 14.  Således er det ikke eders himmelske Faders Villie, at en eneste
      af disse små skal fortabes.

 15.  Men om din Broder synder imod dig, da gå hen og revs ham mellem
      dig og ham alene; hører han dig, da har du vundet din Broder.
 16.  Men hører han dig ikke, da tag endnu een eller to med dig, for
      at "hver Sag må stå fast efter to eller tre Vidners Mund."
 17.  Men er han dem overhørig, da sig det til Menigheden; men er han
      også Menigheden overhørig, da skal han være for dig ligesom en
      Hedning og en Tolder.
 18.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, hvad som helst I binde på Jorden, skal
      være bundet i Himmelen; og hvad som helst I løse på Jorden, skal
      være løst i Himmelen.
 19.  Atter siger jeg eder, at dersom to af eder blive enige på Jorden
      om hvilken som helst Sag, hvorom de ville bede, da skal det
      blive dem til Del fra min Fader, som er i Himlene.
 20.  Thi hvor to eller tre ere forsamlede om mit Navn, der er jeg
      midt iblandt dem."

 21.  Da trådte Peter frem og sagde til ham: "Herre! hvor ofte skal
      jeg tilgive min Broder, når han synder imod mig? mon indtil syv
      Gange?"
 22.  Jesus siger til ham: "Jeg siger dig: ikke indtil syv Gange, men
      indtil halvfjerdsindstyve Gange syv Gange.
 23.  Derfor lignes Himmeriges Rige ved en Konge, som vilde holde
      Regnskab med sine Tjenere.
 24.  Men da han begyndte at holde Regnskab, blev en, som var ti
      Tusinde Talenter skyldig, ført frem for ham.
 25.  Og da han intet havde at betale med, bød hans Herre, at han og
      hans Hustru og Børn og alt det, han havde, skulde sælges, og
      Gælden betales.
 26.  Da faldt Tjeneren ned for ham, bønfaldt ham og sagde: Herre, vær
      langmodig med mig, så vil jeg betale dig det alt sammen.
 27.  Da ynkedes samme Tjeners Herre inderligt over ham og lod ham løs
      og eftergav ham Gælden.
 28.  Men den samme Tjener gik ud og traf en af sine Medtjenere, som
      var ham hundrede Denarer skyldig; og han greb fat på ham og var
      ved at kvæle ham og sagde: Betal, hvad du er skyldig!
 29.  Da faldt hans Medtjener ned for ham og bad ham og sagde: Vær
      langmodig med mig, så vil jeg betale dig.
 30.  Men han vilde ikke, men gik hen og kastede ham i Fængsel, indtil
      han betalte, hvad han var skyldig.
 31.  Da nu hans Medtjenere så det, som skete, bleve de såre bedrøvede
      og kom og forklarede for deres Herre alt, hvad der var sket.
 32.  Da kalder hans Herre ham for sig og siger til ham: Du onde
      Tjener!  al den Gæld eftergav jeg dig, fordi du bad mig.
 33.  Burde ikke også du forbarme dig over din Medtjener, ligesom jeg
      har forbarmet mig over dig.
 34.  Og hans Herre blev vred og overgav ham til Bødlerne, indtil han
      kunde få betalt alt det, han var ham skyldig.
 35.  Således skal også min himmelske Fader gøre mod eder, om I ikke
      af Hjertet tilgive, enhver sin Broder."

Matt. 19

  1.  Og det skete, da Jesus havde fuldendt disse Ord, drog han bort
      fra Galilæa og kom til Judæas Egne, hinsides Jordan.
  2.  Og store Skarer fulgte ham, og han helbredte dem der.

  3.  Og Farisæerne kom til ham, fristede ham og sagde: "Er det
      tilladt at skille sig fra sin Hustru af hvilken som helst
      Grund?"
  4.  Men han svarede og sagde: "Have I ikke læst, at Skaberen fra
      Begyndelsen skabte dem som Mand og Kvinde
  5.  og sagde: Derfor skal en Mand forlade sin Fader og sin Moder og
      holde sig til sin Hustru, og de to skulle blive til eet Kød?
  6.  Således ere de ikke længer to, men eet Kød. Derfor, hvad Gud har
      sammenføjet, må et Menneske ikke adskille."
  7.  De sige til ham: "Hvorfor bød da Moses at give et Skilsmissebrev
      og skille sig fra hende?"
  8.  Han siger til dem: "Moses tilstedte eder at skille eder fra
      eders Hustruer for eders Hjerters Hårdheds Skyld; men fra
      Begyndelsen har det ikke været således.
  9.  Men jeg siger eder, at den, som skiller sig fra sin Hustru, når
      det ikke er for Hors Skyld, og tager en anden til Ægte, han
      bedriver Hor; og den, som tager en fraskilt Hustru til Ægte, han
      bedriver Hor."
 10.  Hans Disciple sige til ham: "Står Mandens Sag med Hustruen
      således, da er det ikke godt at gifte sig."
 11.  Men han sagde til dem: "Ikke alle rummer dette Ord, men de, hvem
      det er givet:
 12.  Thi der er Gildinger, som ere fødte således fra Moders Liv; og
      der er Gildinger, som ere gildede af Mennesker; og der er
      Gildinger, som have gildet sig selv for Himmeriges Riges
      Skyld. Den, som kan rumme det, han rumme det!"

 13.  Da blev der båret små Børn til ham, for at han skulde lægge
      Hænderne på dem og bede; men Disciplene truede dem.
 14.  Da sagde Jesus: "Lader de små Børn komme, og formener dem ikke
      at komme til mig; thi Himmeriges Rige hører sådanne til."
 15.  Og han lagde Hænderne på dem, og han drog derfra.

 16.  Og se, en kom til ham og sagde: "Mester! hvad godt skal jeg
      gøre, for at jeg kan få et evigt Liv?"
 17.  Men han sagde til ham: "Hvorfor spørger du mig om det gode? Een
      er den gode. Men vil du indgå til Livet, da hold Budene!"
 18.  Han siger til ham: "Hvilke?" Men Jesus sagde: "Dette: Du må ikke
      slå ihjel; du må ikke bedrive Hor; du må ikke stjæle; du må ikke
      sige falsk Vidnesbyrd;
 19.  ær din Fader og din Moder, og: Du skal elske din Næste som dig
      selv."
 20.  Den unge Mand siger til ham: "Det har jeg holdt alt sammen; hvad
      fattes mig endnu?"
 21.  Jesus sagde til ham: "Vil du være fuldkommen, da gå bort, sælg,
      hvad du ejer, og giv det til fattige, så skal du have en Skat i
      Himmelen; og kom så og følg mig!"
 22.  Men da den unge Mand hørte det Ord, gik han bedrøvet bort; thi
      han havde meget Gods.
 23.  Men Jesus sagde til sine Disciple: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder: En
      rig Kommer vanskeligt ind i Himmeriges Rige.
 24.  Atter siger jeg eder: Det er lettere for en Kamel at gå igennem
      et Nåleøje end for en rig at gå ind i Guds Rige."
 25.  Men da Disciplene hørte dette, forfærdedes de såre og sagde:
      "Hvem kan da blive frelst?"
 26.  Men Jesus så på dem og sagde: "For Mennesker er dette umuligt,
      men for Gud ere alle Ting mulige."

 27.  Da svarede Peter og sagde til ham: "Se, vi have forladt alle
      Ting og fulgt dig; hvad skulle da vi have?"
 28.  Men Jesus sagde til dem: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, at i
      Igenfødelsen, når Menneskesønnen sidder på sin Herligheds Trone,
      skulle også I, som have fulgt mig, sidde på tolv Troner og dømme
      Israels tolv Stammer.
 29.  Og hver, som har forladt Hus eller Brødre eller Søstre eller
      Fader eller Moder eller Hustru eller Børn eller Marker for mit
      Navns Skyld, skal få det mange Fold igen og arve et evigt Liv.
 30.  Men mange af de første skulle blive de sidste, og af de sidste
      de første.

Matt. 20

  1.  Thi Himmeriges Rige ligner en Husbond, som gik ud tidligt om
      Morgenen for at leje Arbejdere til sin Vingård.
  2.  Og da han var bleven enig med Arbejderne om en Denar om Dagen,
      sendte han dem til sin Vingård.
  3.  Og han gik ud ved den tredje Time og så andre stå ledige på
      Torvet,
  4.  og han sagde til dem: Går også I hen i Vingården, og jeg vil
      give eder, hvad som ret er. Og de gik derhen.
  5.  Han gik atter ud ved den sjette og niende Time og gjorde ligeså.
  6.  Og ved den ellevte Time gik han ud og fandt andre stående der,
      og han siger til dem: Hvorfor stå I her ledige hele Dagen?
  7.  De sige til ham: Fordi ingen lejede os. Han siger til dem: Går
      også I hen i Vingården!
  8.  Men da det var blevet Aften, siger Vingårdens Herre til sin
      Foged: Kald på Arbejderne, og betal dem deres Løn, idet du
      begynder med de sidste og ender med de første!
  9.  Og de, som vare lejede ved den ellevte Time, kom og fik hver en
      Denar.
 10.  Men da de første kom, mente de, at de skulde få mere; og også de
      fik hver en Denar.
 11.  Men da de fik den, knurrede de imod Husbonden og sagde:
 12.  Disse sidste have kun arbejdet een Time, og du har gjort dem
      lige med os, som have båret Dagens Byrde og Hede.
 13.  Men han svarede og sagde til en af dem: Ven! jeg gør dig ikke
      Uret; er du ikke bleven enig med mig om en Denar?
 14.  Tag dit og gå! Men jeg vil give denne sidste ligesom dig.
 15.  Eller har jeg ikke Lov at gøre med mit, hvad jeg vil? Eller er
      dit Øje ondt, fordi jeg er god?
 16.  Således skulle de sidste blive de første, og de første de
      sidste; thi mange ere kaldede, men få ere udvalgte."

 17.  Og da Jesus drog op til Jerusalem, tog han de tolv Disciple til
      Side og sagde til dem på Vejen:
 18.  "Se, vi drage op til Jerusalem, og Menneskesønnen skal overgives
      til Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge; og de skulle dømme ham
      til Døden
 19.  og overgive ham til Hedningerne til at spottes og hudstryges og
      korsfæstes; og på den tredje Dag skal han opstå."

 20.  Da gik Zebedæus's Sønners Moder til ham med sine Sønner og faldt
      ned for ham og vilde bede ham om noget.
 21.  Men han sagde til hende: "Hvad vil du?" Hun siger til ham: "Sig,
      at disse mine to Sønner skulle i dit Rige sidde den ene ved din
      højre, den anden ved din venstre Side."
 22.  Men Jesus svarede og sagde: "I vide ikke, hvad I bede om. Kunne
      I drikke den Kalk, som jeg skal drikke?" De sige til ham: "Det
      kunne vi."
 23.  Han siger til dem: "Min Kalk skulle I vel drikke; men det at
      sidde ved min højre og ved min venstre Side tilkommer det ikke
      mig at give; men det gives til dem, hvem det er beredt af min
      Fader."
 24.  Og da de ti hørte dette, bleve de vrede på de to Brødre.
 25.  Men Jesus kaldte dem til sig og sagde: "I vide, at Folkenes
      Fyrster herske over dem, og de store bruge Myndighed over dem.
 26.  Således skal det ikke være iblandt eder; men den, som vil blive
      stor iblandt eder, han skal være eders Tjener;
 27.  og den, som vil være den ypperste iblandt eder, han skal være
      eders Træl.
 28.  Ligesom Menneskesønnen ikke er kommen for at lade sig tjene, men
      for at tjene og give sit Liv til en Genløsning for mange."


 29.  Og da de gik ud af Jeriko, fulgte en stor Folkeskare ham.
 30.  Og se, to blinde sade ved Vejen, og da de hørte, at Jesus gik
      forbi, råbte de og sagde: "Herre, forbarm dig over os, du Davids
      Søn!"
 31.  Men Skaren truede dem, at de skulde tie; men de råbte endnu
      stærkere og sagde: "Herre, forbarm dig over os, du Davids Søn!"
 32.  Og Jesus stod stille og kaldte på dem og sagde: "Hvad ville I,
      at jeg skal gøre for eder?"
 33.  De sige til ham: "Herre! at vore Øjne måtte oplades."
 34.  Og Jesus ynkedes inderligt og rørte ved deres Øjne. Og straks
      bleve de seende, og de fulgte ham.

Matt. 21

  1.  Og da de nærmede sig Jerusalem og kom til Bethfage ved
      Oliebjerget, da udsendte Jesus to Disciple og sagde til dem:
  2.  "Går hen i den Landsby, som ligger lige for eder; og straks
      skulle I finde en Aseninde bunden og et Føl hos hende; løser dem
      og fører dem til mig!
  3.  Og dersom nogen siger noget til eder, da siger, at Herren har
      Brug for dem, så skal han straks sende dem."
  4.  Men dette er sket, for at det skulde opfyldes, der er talt ved
      Profeten, som siger:
  5.  "Siger til Zions Datter: Se, din Konge kommer til dig, sagtmodig
      og ridende på et Asen og på et Trældyrs Føl."
  6.  Men Disciplene gik hen og gjorde, som Jesus befalede dem;
  7.  og de hentede Aseninden og Føllet og lagde deres Klæder på dem,
      og han satte sig derpå.
  8.  Men de fleste af Folkeskaren bredte deres Klæder på Vejen, andre
      huggede Grene af Træerne og strøede dem på Vejen.
  9.  Men Skarerne, som gik foran ham og fulgte efter, råbte og sagde:
      "Hosanna Davids Søn! velsignet være den, som kommer, i Herrens
      Navn!  Hosanna i det højeste!"
 10.  Og da han drog ind i Jerusalem, kom hele Staden i Bevægelse og
      sagde: "Hvem er denne?"
 11.  Men Skarerne sagde: "Det er Profeten Jesus fra Nazareth i
      Galilæa."

 12.  Og Jesus gik ind i Guds Helligdom og uddrev alle dem, som solgte
      og købte i Helligdommen, og han væltede Vekselerernes Borde og
      Duekræmmernes Stole.
 13.  Og han siger til dem: "Der er skrevet: Mit Hus skal kaldes et
      Bedehus; men I gøre det til en Røverkule."
 14.  Og der kom blinde og lamme til ham i Helligdommen, og han
      helbredte dem.
 15.  Men da Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge så de Undergerninger,
      som han gjorde, og Børnene, som råbte i Helligdommen og sagde:
      "Hosanna Davids Søn!" bleve de vrede og sagde til ham:
 16.  "Hører du, hvad disse sige?" Men Jesus siger til dem: "Ja! have
      I aldrig læst: Af umyndiges og diendes Mund har du beredt dig
      Lovsang?"
 17.  Og han forlod dem og gik uden for Staden til Bethania og
      overnattede der.

 18.  Men da han om Morgenen igen gik ind til Staden, blev hen
      hungrig.
 19.  Og han så et Figentræ ved Vejen og gik hen til det, og han fandt
      intet derpå uden Blade alene. Og han siger til det: "Aldrig i
      Evighed skal der vokse Frugt mere på dig!" Og Figentræet visnede
      straks.
 20.  Og da Disciplene så det, forundrede de sig og sagde: "Hvorledes
      kunde Figentræet straks visne?"
 21.  Men Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder,
      dersom I have Tro og ikke tvivle, da skulle I ikke alene kunne
      gøre det med Figentræet, men dersom I endog sige til dette
      Bjerg: Løft dig op og kast dig i Havet, da skal det ske.
 22.  Og alt, hvad I begære i Bønnen troende, det skulle I få."

 23.  Og da han kom ind i Helligdommen, kom Ypperstepræsterne og
      Folkets Ældste hen til ham, medens han lærte, og de sagde: "Af
      hvad Magt gør du disse Ting, og hvem har givet dig denne Magt?"
 24.  Men Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Også jeg vil spørge eder om
      een Ting, og dersom I sige mig det, vil også jeg sige eder, af
      hvad Magt jeg gør disse Ting.
 25.  Johannes's Dåb, hvorfra var den? Fra Himmelen eller fra
      Mennesker?" Men de tænkte ved sig selv og sagde: "Sige vi: Fra
      Himmelen, da vil han sige til os: Hvorfor troede I ham da ikke?
 26.  Men sige vi: Fra Mennesker, frygte vi for Mængden; thi de holde
      alle Johannes for en Profet."
 27.  Og de svarede Jesus og sagde: "Det vide vi ikke." Da sagde også
      han til dem: "Så siger ikke heller jeg eder, af hvad Magt jeg
      gør disse Ting.

 28.  Men hvad tykkes eder? En Mand havde to Børn; og han gik til den
      første og sagde: Barn! gå hen, arbejd i Dag i min Vingård!
 29.  Men han svarede og sagde: Nej, jeg vil ikke; men bagefter
      fortrød han det og gik derhen.
 30.  Og han gik til den anden og sagde ligeså. Men han svarede og
      sagde: Ja, Herre! og gik ikke derhen.
 31.  Hvem af de to gjorde Faderens Villie?" De sige: "Den første."
      Jesus siger til dem: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, at Toldere og
      Skøger gå forud for eder ind i Guds Rige.
 32.  Thi Johannes kom til eder på Retfærdigheds Vej, og I troede ham
      ikke, men Toldere og Skøger troede ham; men endskønt I så det,
      fortrøde I det alligevel ikke bagefter, så I troede ham.

 33.  Hører en anden Lignelse: Der var en Husbond, som plantede en
      Vingård og satte et Gærde omkring den og gravede en Perse i den
      og byggede et Tårn; og han lejede den ud til Vingårdsmænd og
      drog udenlands.
 34.  Men da Frugttiden nærmede sig, sendte han sine Tjenere til
      Vingårdsmændene for at få dens Frugter.
 35.  Og Vingårdsmændene grebe hans Tjenere, og en sloge de, en dræbte
      de, og en stenede de.
 36.  Atter sendte han andre Tjenere hen, flere end de første; og de
      gjorde ligeså med dem.
 37.  Men til sidst sendte han sin Søn til dem og sagde: De ville
      undse sig for min Søn.
 38.  Men da Vingårdsmændene så Sønnen, sagde de til hverandre: Det er
      Arvingen; kommer lader os slå ham ihjel og få hans Arv!
 39.  Og de grebe ham og kastede ham ud af Vingården og sloge ham
      ihjel.
 40.  Når da Vingårdens Herre kommer, hvad vil han så gøre med disse
      Vingårdsmænd?"
 41.  De sige til ham: "Ilde vil han ødelægge de onde og leje sin
      Vingård ud til andre Vingårdsmænd, som ville give ham Frugterne
      i deres Tid."
 42.  Jesus siger til dem: "Have I aldrig læst i Skrifterne: Den Sten,
      som Bygningsmændene forkastede, den er bleven til en
      Hovedhjørnesten; fra Herren er dette kommet, og det er underligt
      for vore Øjne.
 43.  Derfor siger jeg eder, at Guds Rige skal tages fra eder og gives
      til et Folk, som bærer dets Frugter.
 44.  Og den, som falder på denne Sten, skal slå sig sønder; men hvem
      den falder på, ham skal den knuse."
 45.  Og da Ypperstepræsterne og Farisæerne hørte hans Lignelser,
      forstode de, at han talte om dem.
 46.  Og de søgte at gribe ham, men frygtede for Skarerne; thi de
      holdt ham for en Profet.

Matt. 22

  1.  Og Jesus tog til Orde og talte atter i Lignelser til dem og
      sagde:
  2.  "Himmeriges Rige lignes ved en Konge, som gjorde Bryllup for sin
      Søn.
  3.  Og han udsendte sine Tjenere for at kalde de budne til
      Brylluppet; og de vilde ikke komme.
  4.  Han udsendte atter andre Tjenere og sagde: Siger til de budne:
      Se, jeg har beredt mit Måltid, mine Okser og Fedekvæget er
      slagtet, og alting er rede; kommer til Brylluppet!
  5.  Men de brøde sig ikke derom og gik hen, den ene på sin Mark, den
      anden til sit Købmandsskab;
  6.  og de øvrige grebe hans Tjenere, forhånede og ihjelsloge dem.
  7.  Men Kongen blev vred og sendte sine Hære ud og slog disse
      Manddrabere ihjel og satte Ild på deres Stad.
  8.  Da siger han til sine Tjenere: Brylluppet er beredt, men de
      budne vare det ikke værd.
  9.  Går derfor ud på Skillevejene og byder til Brylluppet så mange,
      som I finde!
 10.  Og de Tjenere gik ud på Vejene og samlede alle dem, de fandt,
      både onde og gode; og Bryllupshuset blev fuldt af Gæster.
 11.  Da nu Kongen gik ind for at se Gæsterne, så han der et Menneske,
      som ikke var iført Bryllupsklædning.
 12.  Og han siger til ham: Ven! hvorledes er du kommen herind og har
      ingen Bryllupsklædning på? Men han tav.
 13.  Da sagde Kongen til Tjenerne: Binder Fødder og Hænder på ham, og
      kaster ham ud i Mørket udenfor; der skal der være Gråd og
      Tænders Gnidsel.
 14.  Thi mange ere kaldede, men få ere udvalgte."

 15.  Da gik Farisæerne hen og holdt Råd om, hvorledes de kunde fange
      ham i Ord.
 16.  Og de sende deres Disciple til ham tillige med Herodianerne og
      sige: "Mester! vi vide, at du er sanddru og lærer Guds Vej i
      Sandhed og ikke bryder dig om nogen; thi du ser ikke på
      Menneskers Person.
 17.  Sig os derfor: Hvad tykkes dig? Er det tilladt at give Kejseren
      Skat eller ej?"
 18.  Men da Jesus mærkede deres Ondskab, sagde han: "I Hyklere,
      hvorfor friste I mig?
 19.  Viser mig Skattens Mønt!" Og de bragte ham en Denar".
 20.  Og han siger til dem: "Hvis Billede og Overskrift er dette?"
 21.  De sige til ham: "Kejserens." Da siger han til dem: "Så giver
      Kejseren, hvad Kejserens er, og Gud, hvad Guds er!"
 22.  Og da de hørte det,undrede de sig, og de forlode ham og gik
      bort.

 23.  Samme Dag kom der Saddukæere til ham, hvilke sige, at der ingen
      Opstandelse er, og de spurgte ham og, sagde:
 24.  "Mester! Moses har sagt: Når nogen dør og ikke har Børn, skal
      hans Broder for Svogerskabets Skyld tage hans Hustru til Ægte og
      oprejse sin Broder Afkom.
 25.  Men nu var der hos os syv Brødre; og den første giftede sig og
      døde; og efterdi han ikke havde Afkom, efterlod han sin Hustru
      til sin Broder.
 26.  Ligeså også den anden og den tredje, indtil den syvende;
 27.  men sidst af alle døde Hustruen.
 28.  Hvem af disse syv skal nu have hende til Hustru i Opstandelsen?
      thi de have alle haft hende."
 29.  Men Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "I fare vild, idet I ikke
      kende Skrifterne, ej heller Guds Kraft.
 30.  Thi i Opstandelsen tage de hverken til Ægte eller bortgiftes,
      men de ere ligesom Guds Engle i Himmelen.
 31.  Men hvad de dødes Opstandelse angår, have I da ikke læst, hvad
      der er talt til eder af Gud, når han siger:
 32.  Jeg er Abrahams Gud og Isaks Gud og Jakobs Gud. Han er ikke
      dødes, men levendes Gud."
 33.  Og da Skarerne hørte dette, bleve de slagne af Forundring over
      hans Lære.

 34.  Men da Farisæerne hørte, at han havde stoppet Munden på
      Saddukæerne, forsamlede de sig.
 35.  Og en af dem, en lovkyndig, spurgte og fristede ham og sagde:
 36.  "Mester, hvilket er det store Bud i Loven?"
 37.  Men han sagde til ham: "Du skal elske Herren din Gud med hele
      dit Hjerte og med hele din Sjæl og med hele dit Sind.
 38.  Dette er det store og første Bud.
 39.  Men et andet er dette ligt: Du skal elske din Næste som dig
      selv.
 40.  Af disse to Bud afhænger hele Loven og Profeterne."

 41.  Men da Farisæerne vare forsamlede, spurgte Jesus dem og sagde:
 42.  "Hvad tykkes eder om Kristus? Hvis Søn er han?" De sige til ham:
      "Davids."
 43.  Han siger til dem: "Hvorledes kan da David i Ånden kalde ham
      Herre, idet han siger:
 44.  Herren sagde til min Herre: Sæt dig ved min højre Hånd, indtil
      jeg får lagt dine Fjender under dine Fødder.
 45.  Når nu David kalder ham Herre, hvorledes er han da hans Søn?"
 46.  Og ingen kunde svare ham et Ord, og ingen vovede mere at rette
      Spørgsmål til ham efter den Dag.

Matt. 23

  1.  Da talte Jesus til Skarerne og til sine Disciple og sagde:
  2.  På Mose Stol sidde de skriftkloge og Farisæerne.
  3.  Gører og holder derfor alt, hvad de sige eder; men gører ikke
      efter deres Gerninger; thi de sige det vel, men gøre det ikke.
  4.  Men de binde svare Byrder, vanskelige at bære, og lægge dem på
      Menneskenes Skuldre;men selv ville de ikke bevæge dem med en
      Finger.
  5.  Men de gøre alle deres Gerninger for at beskues af Menneskene;
      thi de gøre deres Bederemme brede og Kvasterne på deres Klæder
      store.
  6.  Og de ville gerne sidde øverst til Bords ved Måltiderne og på de
      fornemste Pladser i Synagogerne
  7.  og lade sig hilse på Torvene og kaldes Rabbi af Menneskene.
  8.  Men I skulle ikke lade eder kalde Rabbi; thi een er eders
      Mester, men I ere alle Brødre.
  9.  Og I skulle ikke kalde nogen på Jorden eders Fader; thi een er
      eders Fader, han, som er i Himlene.
 10.  Ej heller skulle I lade eder kalde Vejledere; thi een er eders
      Vejleder, Kristus.
 11.  Men den største iblandt eder skal være eders Tjener.
 12.  Men den, som ophøjer sig selv, skal fornedres, og den, som
      fornedrer sig selv, skal ophøjes.
 13.  Men ve eder, I skriftkloge og Farisæere, I Hyklere! thi I
      tillukke Himmeriges Rige for Menneskene; thi I gå ikke derind,
      og dem, som ville gå ind, tillade I det ikke.
 14.  Ve eder, I skriftkloge og Farisæere, I Hyklere! thi I opæde
      Enkers Huse og bede på Skrømt længe; derfor skulle I få des
      hårdere Dom.
 15.  Ve eder, I skriftkloge og Farisæere, I Hyklere! thi I drage om
      til Vands og til Lands for at vinde en eneste Tilhænger; og når
      han er bleven det, gøre I ham til et Helvedes Barn, dobbelt så
      slemt, som I selv ere.
 16.  Ve eder, I blinde Vejledere! I, som sige: Den, som sværger ved
      Templet, det er intet; men den, som sværger ved Guldet i
      Templet, han er forpligtet.
 17.  I Dårer og blinde! hvilket er da størst? Guldet eller Templet,
      som helliger Guldet?
 18.  Fremdeles: Den, som sværger ved Alteret, det er intet; men den,
      som sværger ved Gaven derpå, han er forpligtet.
 19.  I Dårer og blinde! hvilket er da størst? Gaven eller Alteret,
      som helliger Gaven?
 20.  Derfor, den, som sværger ved Alteret, sværger ved det og ved alt
      det, som er derpå.
 21.  Og den, som sværger ved Templet, sværger ved det og ved ham, som
      bor deri.
 22.  Og den, som sværger ved Himmelen, sværger ved Guds Trone og ved
      ham, som sidder på den.
 23.  Ve eder, I skriftkloge og Farisæere, I Hyklere! thi I give
      Tiende af Mynte og Dild og Kommen og have forsømt de Ting i
      Loven, der have større Vægt, Retten og Barmhjertigheden og
      Troskaben. Disse Ting burde man gøre og ikke forsømme hine.
 24.  I blinde Vejledere, I, som si Myggen af, men nedsluge Kamelen!
 25.  Ve eder, I skriftkloge og Farisæere, I Hyklere! thi I rense det
      udvendige af Bægeret og Fadet; men indvendigt ere de fulde af
      Rov og Umættelighed.
 26.  Du blinde Farisæer! rens først det indvendige af Bægeret og
      Fadet, for at også det udvendige af dem kan blive rent.
 27.  Ve eder, I skriftkloge og Farisæere, I Hyklere! thi I ere
      ligesom kalkede Grave, der jo synes dejlige udvendigt,men
      indvendigt ere fulde af døde Ben og al Urenhed.
 28.  Således synes også I vel udvortes retfærdige for Menneskene; men
      indvortes ere I fulde af Hykleri og Lovløshed.
 29.  Ve eder, I skriftkloge og Farisæere, I Hyklere! thi I bygge
      Profeternes Grave og pryde de retfærdiges Gravsteder og sige:
 30.  Havde vi været til i vore Fædres Dage, da havde vi ikke været
      delagtige med dem i Profeternes Blod.
 31.  Altså give I eder selv det Vidnesbyrd, at I ere Sønner af dem,
      som have ihjelslået Profeterne.
 32.  Så gører da også I eders Fædres Mål fuldt!
 33.  I Slanger! I Øgleunger! hvorledes kunne I undfly Helvedes Dom?

 34.  Derfor se, jeg sender til eder Profeter og vise og skriftkloge;
      nogle af dem skulle I slå ihjel og korsfæste, og nogle af dem
      skulle I hudstryge i, eders Synagoger og forfølge fra Stad til
      Stad,
 35.  for at alt det retfærdige Blod skal komme over eder, som er
      udgydt på Jorden, fra den retfærdige Abels Blod indtil
      Sakarias's, Barakias's Søns,Blod, hvem I sloge ihjel imellem
      Templet og Alteret.
 36.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, alt dette skal komme over denne Slægt.
 37.  Jerusalem! Jerusalem! som ihjelslår Profeterne og stener dem,
      som ere sendte til dig, hvor ofte vilde jeg samle dine Børn,
      ligesom en Høne samler sine Kyllinger under Vingerne! Og I vilde
      ikke.
 38.  Se, eders Hus lades eder øde!
 39.  Thi jeg siger eder: I skulle ingenlunde se mig fra nu af, indtil
      I sige: Velsignet være den, som kommer, i Herrens Navn!"

Matt. 24

  1.  Og Jesus gik ud, bort fra Helligdommen, og hans Disciple kom til
      ham for at vise ham Helligdommens Bygninger.
  2.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Se I ikke alt dette?
      Sandelig, siger jeg eder, her skal ikke lades Sten på Sten, som
      jo skal nedbrydes."
  3.  Men da han sad på Oliebjerget, kom hans Disciple til ham afsides
      og sagde: "Sig os, når skal dette ske? Og hvad er Tegnet på din
      Tilkommelse og Verdens Ende?"
  4.  Og Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Ser til, at ingen forfører
      eder!
  5.  Thi mange skulle på mit Navn komme og sige: Jeg er Kristus; og
      de skulle forføre mange.
  6.  Men I skulle få at høre om Krige og Krigsrygter. Ser til, lader
      eder ikke forskrække; thi det må ske; men Enden er ikke endda.
  7.  Thi Folk skal rejse sig mod Folk, og Rige mod Rige, og der skal
      være Hungersnød og Jordskælv her og der.
  8.  Men alt dette er Veernes Begyndelse.
  9.  Da skulle de overgive eder til Trængsel og slå eder ihjel, og I
      skulle hades af alle Folkeslagene for mit Navns Skyld.
 10.  Og da skulle mange forarges og forråde hverandre og hade
      hverandre.
 11.  Og mange falske Profeter skulle fremstå og forføre mange.
 12.  Og fordi Lovløsheden bliver mangfoldig, vil Kærligheden blive
      kold hos de fleste.
 13.  Men den, som holder ud indtil Enden, han skal frelses.
 14.  Og dette Rigets Evangelium skal prædikes i hele Verden til et
      Vidnesbyrd for alle Folkeslagene; og da skal Enden komme.
 15.  Når I da se Ødelæggelsens Vederstyggelighed, hvorom der er talt
      ved Profeten Daniel, stå på hellig Grund, (den, som læser det,
      han give Agt!)
 16.  da skulle de, som ere i Judæa, fly ud på Bjergene;
 17.  den, som er på Taget, stige ikke ned for at hente, hvad der er i
      hans Hus;
 18.  og den, som er på Marken, vende ikke tilbage før at hente sine
      Klæder!
 19.  Men ve de frugtsommelige og dem, som give Die, i de Dage!
 20.  Og beder om, at eders Flugt ikke skal ske om Vinteren, ej heller
      på en Sabbat;
 21.  thi der skal da være en Trængsel så stor, som der ikke har været
      fra Verdens Begyndelse indtil nu og heller ikke skal komme.
 22.  Og dersom disse Dage ikke bleve afkortede, da blev intet Kød
      frelst; men for de udvalgtes Skyld skulle disse Dage afkortes.
 23.  Dersom nogen da siger til eder: Se, her er Kristus, eller der!
      da skulle I ikke tro det.
 24.  Thi falske Krister og falske Profeter skulle fremstå og gøre
      store Tegn og Undergerninger, så at også de udvalgte skulde
      blive forførte, om det var muligt.
 25.  Se, jeg har sagt eder det forud.
 26.  Derfor, om de sige til eder: Se, han er i Ørkenen, da går ikke
      derud; se. han er i Kamrene, da tror det ikke!
 27.  Thi ligesom Lynet udgår fra Østen og lyser indtil Vesten,
      således skal Menneskesønnens Tilkommelse være.
 28.  Hvor Ådselet er, der ville Ørnene samle sig.
 29.  Men straks efter de Dages Trængsel skal Solen formørkes og Månen
      ikke give sit Skin og Stjernerne falde ned fra Himmelen, og
      Himmelens Kræfter skulle rystes.
 30.  Og da skal Menneskesønnens Tegn vise sig på Himmelen; og da
      skulle alle Jordens Stammer jamre sig, og de skulle se
      Menneskesønnen komme på Himmelens Skyer med Kraft og megen
      Herlighed.
 31.  Og han skal udsende sine Engle med stærktlydende Basun, og de
      skulle samle hans udvalgte fra de fire Vinde, fra den ene Ende
      af Himmelen til den anden.
 32.  Men lærer Lignelsen af Figentræet: Når dets Gren allerede er
      bleven blød,og Bladene skyde frem, da skønne I, at Sommeren er
      nær.
 33.  Således skulle også I, når I se alt dette, skønne, at han er nær
      for Døren.
 34.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, denne Slægt skal ingenlunde forgå,
      førend alle disse Ting ere skete.
 35.  Himmelen og Jorden skulle forgå, men mine Ord skulle ingenlunde
      forgå.
 36.  Men om den Dag og Time ved ingen, end ikke Himmelens Engle,
      heller ikke Sønnen, men kun Faderen alene.
 37.  Og ligesom Noas dage vare, således skal Menneskesønnens
      Tilkommelse være.
 38.  Thi ligesom de i Dagene før Syndfloden åde og drak, toge til
      Ægte og bortgiftede, indtil den Dag, da Noa gik ind i Arken,
 39.  og ikke agtede det, førend Syndfloden kom og tog dem alle bort,
      således skal også Menneskesønnens Tilkommelse være.
 40.  Da skulle to Mænd være på Marken; den ene tages med, og den
      anden lades tilbage.
 41.  To Kvinder skulle male på Kværnen; den ene tages med, og den
      anden lades tilbage.

 42.  Våger derfor, thi I vide ikke, på hvilken Dag eders Herre
      kommer.
 43.  Men dette skulle I vide, at dersom Husbonden vidste. i hvilken
      Nattevagt Tyven vilde komme, da vågede han og tillod ikke, at
      der skete Indbrud i hans Hus.
 44.  Derfor vorder også I rede; thi Menneskesønnen kommer i den Time,
      som I ikke mene.
 45.  Hvem er så den tro og forstandige Tjener, som hans Herre har sat
      over sit Tyende til at give dem deres Mad i rette Tid?
 46.  Salig er den Tjener, hvem hans Herre, når han kommer, finder
      handlende således.
 47.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, han skal sætte ham over alt, hvad han
      ejer.
 48.  Men dersom den onde Tjener siger i sit Hjerte: Min Herre tøver,
 49.  og så begynder at slå sine Medtjenere og spiser og drikker med
      Drankerne,
 50.  da skal den Tjeners Herre komme på den Dag, han ikke venter, og
      i den Time, han ikke ved,
 51.  og hugge ham sønder og give ham hans Lod sammen med Hyklerne;
      der skal der være Gråd og Tænders Gnidsel.

Matt. 25

  1.  Da skal Himmeriges Rige lignes ved ti Jomfruer, som toge deres
      Lamper og gik Brudgommen i Møde.
  2.  Men fem af dem vare Dårer, og fem kloge.
  3.  Dårerne toge nemlig deres Lamper, men toge ikke Olie med sig.
  4.  Men de kloge toge Olie i deres Kar tillige med deres Lamper.
  5.  Og da Brudgommen tøvede, slumrede de alle ind og sov.
  6.  Men ved Midnat lød der et Råb: Se, Brudgommen kommer, går ham i
      Møde!
  7.  Da vågnede alle Jomfruerne og gjorde deres Lamper i Stand.
  8.  Men Dårerne sagde til de kloge: Giver os af eders Olie; thi vore
      Lamper slukkes.
  9.  Men de kloge svarede og sagde: Der vilde vist ikke blive nok til
      os og til eder; går hellere hen til Købmændene og køber til eder
      selv!
 10.  Men medens de gik bort for at købe, kom Brudgommen, og de, som
      vare rede, gik ind med ham til Brylluppet; og Døren blev lukket.
 11.  Men senere komme også de andre Jomfruer og sige: Herre, Herre,
      luk op for os!
 12.  Men han svarede og sagde: Sandelig, siger jeg eder, jeg kender
      eder ikke.
 13.  Våger derfor, thi I vide ikke Dagen, ej heller Timen.

 14.  Thi det er ligesom en Mand, der drog udenlands og kaldte på sine
      Tjenere og overgav dem sin Ejendom;
 15.  og en gav han fem Talenter, en anden to, og en tredje en, hver
      efter hans Evne; og straks derefter drog han udenlands.
 16.  Men den, som havde fået de fem Talenter, gik hen og købslog med
      dem og vandt andre fem Talenter
 17.  Ligeså vandt også den, som havde fået de to Talenter,andre to.
 18.  Men den, som havde fået den ene, gik bort og gravede i Jorden og
      skjulte sin Herres Penge.
 19.  Men lang Tid derefter kommer disse Tjeneres Herre og holder
      Regnskab med dem.
 20.  Og den, som havde fået de fem Talenter, kom frem og bragte andre
      fem Talenter og sagde: Herre! du overgav mig fem Talenter; se,
      jeg har vundet fem andre Talenter.
 21.  Hans Herre sagde til ham: Vel, du gode og tro Tjener! du var tro
      over lidet, jeg vil sætte dig over meget; gå ind til din Herres
      Glæde!
 22.  Da kom også han frem, som havde fået de to Talenter, og sagde:
      Herre! du overgav mig to Talenter; se, jeg har vundet to andre
      Talenter.
 23.  Hans Herre sagde til ham: Vel, du gode og tro Tjener! du var tro
      over lidet, jeg vil sætte dig over meget; gå ind til din Herres
      glæde!
 24.  Men også han, som havde fået den ene Talent, kom frem og sagde:
      Herre! jeg kendte dig, at du er en hård Mand, som høster, hvor
      du ikke såede, og samler, hvor du ikke spredte;
 25.  og jeg frygtede og gik hen og skjulte din Talent i Jorden; se,
      her har du, hvad dit er.
 26.  Men hans Herre svarede og sagde til ham: Du onde og lade Tjener!
      du vidste, at jeg høster, hvor jeg ikke såede, og samler, hvor
      jeg ikke spredte;
 27.  derfor burde du have overgivet Vekselererne mine Penge; og når
      jeg kom, da havde jeg fået mit igen med Rente.
 28.  Tager derfor den Talent fra ham, og giver den til ham, som har
      de ti Talenter.
 29.  Thi enhver, som har, ham skal der gives, og han skal få
      Overflod; men den, som ikke har, fra ham skal endog det tages,
      som han har.
 30.  Og kaster den unyttige Tjener ud i Mørket udenfor; der skal der
      være Gråd og Tænders Gnidsel.

 31.  Men når Menneskesønnen kommer i sin Herlighed og alle Englene
      med ham, da skal han sidde på sin Herligheds Trone.
 32.  Og alle Folkeslagene skulle samles foran ham, og han skal skille
      dem fra hverandre, ligesom Hyrden skiller Fårene fra Bukkene.
 33.  Og han skal stille Fårene ved sin højre Side og Bukkene ved den
      venstre.
 34.  Da skal Kongen sige til dem ved sin højre Side: Kommer hid. I
      min Faders velsignede! arver det Rige, som har været eder beredt
      fra Verdens Grundlæggelse.
 35.  Thi jeg var hungrig, og I gave mig at spise; jeg var tørstig, og
      I gave mig at drikke; jeg var fremmed, og I toge mig hjem til
      eder;
 36.  jeg var nøgen, og I klædte mig; jeg var syg, og I besøgte mig;
      jeg var i Fængsel, og I kom til mig.
 37.  Da skulle de retfærdige svare ham og sige: Herre! når så vi dig
      hungrig og gave dig Mad, eller tørstig og gave dig at drikke?
 38.  Når så vi dig fremmed og toge dig hjem til os, eller nøgen og
      klædte dig?
 39.  Når så vi dig syg eller i Fængsel og kom til dig?
 40.  Og Kongen skal svare og sige til dem: Sandelig, siger jeg eder:
      Hvad I have gjort imod een af disse mine mindste Brødre, have I
      gjort imod mig.
 41.  Da skal han også sige til dem ved den venstre Side: Går bort fra
      mig, I forbandede! til den evige Ild, som er beredt Djævelen og
      hans Engle.
 42.  Thi jeg var hungrig, og I gave mig ikke at spise; jeg var
      tørstig, og I gave mig ikke at drikke;
 43.  jeg var fremmed, og I toge mig ikke hjem til eder; jeg var
      nøgen, og I klædte mig ikke; jeg var syg og i Fængsel, og I
      besøgte mig ikke.
 44.  Da skulle også de svare og sige: Herre! når så vi dig hungrig
      eller tørstig eller fremmed eller nøgen eller syg eller i
      Fængsel og tjente dig ikke?
 45.  Da skal han svare dem og sige: Sandelig, siger jeg eder: Hvad I
      ikke have gjort imod een af disse mindste, have I heller ikke
      gjort imod mig.
 46.  Og disse skulle gå bort til evig Straf, men de retfærdige til
      evigt Liv."

Matt. 26

  1.  Og det skete, da Jesus havde fuldendt alle disse Ord, sagde han
      til sine Disciple:
  2.  "I vide, at om to Dage er det Påske; så forrådes Menneskesønnen
      til at korsfæstes."

  3.  Da forsamledes Ypperstepræsterne og Folkets Ældste i
      Ypperstepræstens Gård; han hed Kajfas.
  4.  Og de rådsloge om at gribe Jesus med List og ihjelslå ham.
  5.  Men de sagde: "Ikke på Højtiden, for at der ikke skal blive
      Oprør iblandt Folket."

  6.  Men da Jesus var kommen til Bethania, i Simon den spedalskes
      Hus,
  7.  kom der en Kvinde til ham, som havde en Alabastkrukke med såre
      kostbar Salve, og hun udgød den på hans Hoved, medens han sad
      til Bords.
  8.  Men da Disciplene så det, bleve de vrede og sagde: "Hvortil
      denne Spilde?
  9.  Dette kunde jo være solgt til en høj Pris og være givet til
      fattige."
 10.  Men da Jesus mærkede det, sagde han til dem: "Hvorfor volde I
      Kvinden Fortrædeligheder? Hun har jo gjort en god Gerning imod
      mig.
 11.  Thi de fattige have I altid hos eder; men mig have I ikke altid.
 12.  Thi da hun udgød denne Salve over mit Legeme, gjorde hun det for
      at berede mig til at begraves.
 13.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, hvor som helst i hele Verden dette
      Evangelium bliver prædiket, skal også det, som hun har gjort,
      omtales til hendes Ihukommelse."

 14.  Da gik en af de tolv, han, som hed Judas Iskariot, hen til
      Ypperstepræsterne
 15.  og sagde: "Hvad ville I give mig, så skal jeg forråde ham til
      eder?" Men de betalte ham tredive Sølvpenge".
 16.  Og fra den Stund søgte han Lejlighed til at forråde ham.

 17.  Men på den første Dag af de usyrede Brøds Højtid kom Disciplene
      til Jesus og sagde: "Hvor vil du, at vi skulle træffe
      Forberedelse for dig til at spise Påskelammet?"
 18.  Men han sagde: "Går ind i Staden til den og den Mand, og siger
      til ham: Mesteren siger: Min Time er nær; hos dig holder jeg
      Påske med mine Disciple."
 19.  Og Disciplene gjorde, som Jesus befalede dem, og beredte
      Påskelammet.
 20.  Men da det var blevet Aften, sad han til Bords med de tolv.
 21.  Og medens de spiste, sagde han: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, en af
      eder vil forråde mig."
 22.  Og de bleve såre bedrøvede og begyndte hver især at sige til
      ham: "Det er dog vel ikke mig, Herre?"
 23.  Men han svarede og sagde: "Den, som dyppede Hånden tillige med
      mig i Fadet, han vil forråde mig.
 24.  Menneskesønnen går vel bort, som der er skrevet om ham; men ve
      det Menneske, ved hvem Menneskesønnen bliver forrådt! Det var
      godt for det Menneske, om han ikke var født."
 25.  Men Judas, som forrådte ham, svarede og sagde: "Det er dog vel
      ikke mig, Rabbi?" Han siger til ham: "Du har sagt det."

 26.  Men medens de spiste, tog Jesus Brød, og han velsignede og brød
      det og gav Disciplene det og sagde: "Tager, æder; dette er mit
      Legeme."
 27.  Og han tog en Kalk og takkede. gav dem den og sagde: "Drikker
      alle deraf;
 28.  thi dette er mit Blod, Pagtens, hvilket udgydes for mange til
      Syndernes Forladelse.
 29.  Men jeg siger eder, fra nu af skal jeg ingenlunde drikke af
      denne Vintræets Frugt indtil den Dag, da jeg skal drikke den ny
      med eder i min Faders Rige."

 30.  Og da de havde sunget Lovsangen, gik de ud til Oliebjerget.
 31.  Da siger Jesus til dem: "I skulle alle forarges på mig i denne
      Nat; thi der er skrevet: Jeg vil slå Hyrden, og Hjordens Får
      skulle adspredes.
 32.  Men efter at jeg er bleven oprejst, vil jeg gå forud for eder
      til Galilæa."
 33.  Men Peter svarede og sagde til ham: "Om end alle ville forarges
      på dig, så vil jeg dog aldrig forarges."
 34.  Jesus sagde til ham: "Sandelig, siger jeg dig, i denne Nat,
      førend Hanen galer, skal du fornægte mig tre Gange."
 35.  Peter siger til ham: "Om jeg end skulde dø med dig, vil jeg
      ingenlunde fornægte dig." Ligeså sagde også alle Disciplene.

 36.  Da kommer Jesus med dem til en Gård, som kaldes Gethsemane, og
      han siger til Disciplene: "Sætter eder her, medens jeg går
      derhen og beder."
 37.  Og han tog Peter og Zebedæus's to Sønner med sig, og han
      begyndte at bedrøves og svarlig at ængstes.
 38.  Da siger han til dem: "Min Sjæl er dybt bedrøvet indtil Døden;
      bliver her og våger med mig!"
 39.  Og han gik lidt frem, faldt på sit Ansigt, bad og sagde: "Min
      Fader! er det muligt, da gå denne Kalk mig forbi; dog ikke som
      jeg vil, men som du vil."
 40.  Og han kommer til Disciplene og finder dem sovende, og han siger
      til Peter: "Så kunde I da ikke våge een Time med mig!
 41.  Våger og beder, for at I ikke skulle falde i Fristelse! Ånden er
      vel redebon, men Kødet er skrøbeligt."
 42.  Han gik atter anden Gang hen, bad og sagde: "Min Fader! hvis
      denne Kalk ikke kan gå mig forbi, uden jeg drikker den, da ske
      din Villie!"
 43.  Og han kom og fandt dem atter sovende, thi deres Øjne vare
      betyngede.
 44.  Og han forlod dem og gik atter hen og bad tredje Gang og sagde
      atter det samme Ord.
 45.  Da kommer han til Disciplene og siger til dem: "Sove I fremdeles
      og Hvile eder? Se, Timen er nær, og Menneskesønnen forrådes i
      Synderes Hænder.
 46.  Står op, lader os gå; se, han, som forråder mig, er nær."

 47.  Og medens han endnu talte, se, da kom Judas, en af de tolv, og
      med ham en stor Skare, med Sværd og Knipler, fra
      Ypperstepræsterne og Folkets Ældste.
 48.  Men han, som forrådte ham, havde givet dem et Tegn og sagt:
      "Den, som jeg kysser, ham er det; griber ham!"
 49.  Og han trådte straks hen til Jesus og sagde: "Hil være dig,
      Rabbi!" og kyssede ham.
 50.  Men Jesus sagde til ham: "Ven, hvorfor kommer du her?" Da trådte
      de til og lagde Hånd på Jesus og grebe ham.
 51.  Og se, en af dem, som vare med Jesus, rakte Hånden ud og drog
      sit Sværd og slog Ypperstepræstens Tjener og huggede hans Øre
      af.
 52.  Da siger Jesus til ham: "Stik dit Sværd igen på dets Sted; thi
      alle de, som tage Sværd, skulle omkomme ved Sværd.
 53.  Eller mener du, at jeg ikke kan bede min Fader, så han nu
      tilskikker mig mere end tolv Legioner Engle?
 54.  Hvorledes skulde da Skrifterne opfyldes, at det bør gå således
      til?"
 55.  I den samme Time sagde Jesus til Skarerne: "I ere gåede ud
      ligesom imod en Røver med Sværd og Knipler for at fange
      mig. Daglig sad jeg i Helligdommen og lærte, og I grebe mig
      ikke.
 56.  Men det er alt sammen sket, for at Profeternes Skrifter skulde
      opfyldes." Da forlode alle Disciplene ham og flyede.

 57.  Men de, som havde grebet Jesus, førte ham hen til
      Ypperstepræsten Kajfas, hvor de skriftkloge og de Ældste vare
      forsamlede.
 58.  Men Peter fulgte ham i Frastand indtil Ypperstepræstens Gård, og
      han gik indenfor og satte sig hos Svendene for at se, hvad
      Udgang det vilde få.
 59.  Men Ypperstepræsterne og hele Rådet søgte falsk Vidnesbyrd imod
      Jesus, for at de kunde aflive ham.
 60.  Og de fandt intet, endskønt der trådte mange falske Vidner frem.
      Men til sidst trådte to frem og sagde:
 61.  "Denne har sagt: Jeg kan nedbryde Guds Tempel og bygge det op i
      tre Dage."
 62.  Og Ypperstepræsten stod op og sagde til ham: "Svarer du intet
      på, hvad disse vidne imod dig?"
 63.  Men Jesus tav. Og Ypperstepræsten tog til Orde og sagde til ham:
      "Jeg besværger dig ved den levende Gud, at du siger os, om du er
      Kristus, Guds Søn."
 64.  Jesus siger til ham: "Du har sagt det; dog jeg siger eder: Fra
      nu af skulle I se Menneskesønnen sidde ved Kraftens højre Hånd
      og komme på Himmelens Skyer."
 65.  Da sønderrev Ypperstepræsten sine Klæder og sagde: "Han har talt
      bespotteligt; hvad have vi længere Vidner nødig? se, nu have I
      hørt Bespottelsen.
 66.  Hvad tykkes eder?" Og de svarede og sagde: "Han er skyldig til
      Døden."
 67.  Da spyttede de ham i Ansigtet og gave ham Næveslag; andre sloge
      ham på Kinden
 68.  og sagde: "Profeter os, Kristus, hvem var det, der slog dig?"

 69.  Men Peter sad udenfor i Gården; og en Pige kom hen til ham og
      sagde: "Også du var med Jesus Galilæeren."
 70.  Men han nægtede det i alles Påhør og sagde: "Jeg forstår ikke,
      hvad du siger."
 71.  Men da han gik ud i Portrummet, så en anden Pige ham; og hun
      siger til dem, som vare der: "Denne var med Jesus af Nazareth."
 72.  Og han nægtede det atter med en Ed: "Jeg kender ikke det
      Menneske."
 73.  Men lidt efter kom de, som stode der, hen og sagde til Peter:
      "Sandelig, også du er en af dem. dit Mål røber dig jo også."
 74.  Da begyndte han at forbande sig og sværge: "Jeg kender ikke det
      Menneske." Og straks galede Hanen.
 75.  Og Peter kom Jesu Ord i Hu at han havde sagt: "Førend Hanen
      galer, skal du fornægte mig tre Gange." Og han gik udenfor og
      græd bitterligt.

Matt. 27

  1.  Men da det var blevet Morgen, holdt alle Ypperstepræsterne og
      Folkets Ældste Råd imod Jesus for at aflive ham.
  2.  Og de bandt ham og førte ham bort og overgave ham til
      Landshøvdingen Pontius Pilatus.

  3.  Da nu Judas, som forrådte ham, så, at han var bleven domfældt,
      fortrød han det og bragte de tredive Sølvpenge tilbage til
      Ypperstepræsterne og de Ældste og sagde:
  4.  "Jeg har syndet, idet jeg forrådte uskyldigt Blod." Men de
      sagde: "Hvad kommer det os ved? se du dertil."
  5.  Og han kastede Sølvpengene ind i Templet, veg bort og gik hen og
      hængte sig.
  6.  Men Ypperstepræsterne toge Sølvpengene og sagde: "Det er ikke
      tilladt at lægge dem til Tempelskatten; thi det er Blodpenge."
  7.  Men efter at have holdt Råd købte de Pottemagermarken derfor til
      Gravsted for de fremmede.
  8.  Derfor blev den Mark kaldt Blodmarken indtil den Dag i Dag.
  9.  Da opfyldtes det, som er talt ved Profeten Jeremias, som siger:
      "Og de toge de tredive Sølvpenge, Prisen for den vurderede, hvem
      de vurderede for Israels Børn,
 10.  og de gav dem for Pottemagermarken, som Herren befalede mig."

 11.  Men Jesus blev stillet for Landshøvdingen, og Landshøvdingen
      spurgte ham og sagde: "Er du Jødernes Konge?" Men Jesus sagde
      til ham: "Du siger det."
 12.  Og da han blev anklaget af Ypperstepræsterne og de Ældste,
      svarede han intet.
 13.  Da siger Pilatus til ham: "Hører du ikke, hvor meget de vidne
      imod dig?"
 14.  Og han svarede ham end ikke på et eneste Ord, så at
      Landshøvdingen undrede sig såre.
 15.  Men på Højtiden plejede Landshøvdingen at løslade Mængden een
      Fange, hvilken de vilde.
 16.  Og de havde dengang en berygtet Fange, som hed Barabbas.
 17.  Da de vare forsamlede, sagde Pilatus derfor til dem: "Hvem ville
      I, at jeg skal løslade eder: Barabbas eller Jesus, som kaldes
      Kristus?"
 18.  Thi han vidste, at det var af Avind, de havde overgivet ham.
 19.  Men medens han sad på Dommersædet, sendte hans Hustru Bud til
      ham og sagde: "Befat dig ikke med denne retfærdige; thi jeg har
      lidt meget i Dag i en Drøm før hans Skyld."
 20.  Men Ypperstepræsterne og de Ældste overtalte Skarerne til, at de
      skulde begære Barabbas, men ihjelslå Jesus.
 21.  Og Landshøvdingen svarede og sagde til dem: "Hvilken af de to
      ville I, at jeg skal løslade eder?" Men de sagde: "Barabas."
 22.  Pilatus siger til dem: "Hvad skal jeg da gøre med Jesus, som
      kaldes Kristus?" De sige alle: "Lad ham blive korsfæstet!"
 23.  Men Landshøvdingen sagde: "Hvad ondt har han da gjort?" Men de
      råbte end mere og sagde: "Lad ham blive korsfæstet!"
 24.  Men da Pilatus så, at han intet udrettede, men at der blev
      større Larm, tog han Vand og toede sine Hænder i Mængdens Påsyn
      og sagde: "Jeg er uskyldig i denne retfærdiges Blod; ser I
      dertil!"
 25.  Og hele Folket svarede og sagde: "Hans Blod komme over os og
      over vore Børn!"
 26.  Da løslod han dem Barabbas; men Jesus lod han hudstryge og gav
      ham hen til at korsfæstes.

 27.  Da toge Landshøvdingens Stridsmænd Jesus med sig ind i Borgen og
      samlede hele Vagtafdelingen omkring ham.
 28.  Og de afklædte ham og kastede en Skarlagens Kappe om ham.
 29.  Og de flettede en Krone af Torne og satte den på hans Hoved og
      gave ham et Rør i hans højre Hånd; og de faldt på Knæ for ham og
      spottede ham og sagde: "Hil være dig, du Jødernes Konge!"
 30.  Og de spyttede på ham og toge Røret og sloge ham på Hovedet.
 31.  Og da de havde spottet ham, toge de Kappen af ham og iførte ham
      hans egne Klæder og førte ham hen for at korsfæste ham.

 32.  Men medens de gik derud, traf de en Mand fra Kyrene, ved Navn
      Simon; ham tvang de til at bære hans Kors.
 33.  Og da de kom til et Sted, som kaldes Golgatha, det er udlagt:
      "Hovedskalsted",
 34.  gave de ham Eddike at drikke blandet med Galde og da han smagte
      det, vilde han ikke drikke.
 35.  Men da de havde korsfæstet ham, delte de hans Klæder imellem sig
      ved Lodkastning, for at det skulde opfyldes, som er sagt af
      Profeten: "De delte mine Klæder imellem sig og kastede Lod om
      mit Klædebon."
 36.  Og de sade der og holdt Vagt over ham.
 37.  Og oven over hans Hoved satte de Beskyldningen imod ham skreven
      således: "Dette er Jesus, Jødernes Konge."
 38.  Da bliver der korsfæstet to Røvere sammen med ham, en ved den
      højre og en ved den venstre Side,
 39.  Og de, som gik forbi, spottede ham, idet de rystede på deres
      Hoveder og sagde:
 40.  "Du, som nedbryder Templet og bygger det op i tre Dage, frels
      dig selv; er du Guds Søn, da stig ned af Korset!"
 41.  "Ligeså spottede Ypperstepræsterne tillige med de skriftkloge og
      de Ældste og sagde:
 42.  "Andre har han frelst, sig selv kan han ikke frelse; er han
      Israels Konge, så lad ham nu stige ned af Korset, så ville vi
      tro på ham.
 43.  Han har sat sin Lid til Gud;han fri ham nu, om han har Behag i
      ham; thi han har sagt: Jeg er Guds Søn."
 44.  Og på samme Måde hånede også Røverne ham, som vare korsfæstede
      med ham.
 45.  Men fra den sjette Time blev der Mørke over hele Landet indtil
      den niende Time.
 46.  Og ved den niende Time råbte Jesus med høj Røst og sagde: "Eli!
      Eli! Lama Sabaktani?" det er: "Min Gud! min Gud! hvorfor har du
      forladt mig?"
 47.  Men nogle af dem, som stode der og hørte det, sagde: "Han kalder
      på Elias."
 48.  Og straks løb en af dem hen og tog en Svamp og fyldte den med
      Eddike og stak den på et Rør og gav ham at drikke.
 49.  Men de andre sagde: "Holdt! lader os se, om Elias kommer for at
      frelse ham."
 50.  Men Jesus råbte atter med høj Røst og opgav Ånden.
 51.  Og se, Forhænget i Templet splittedes i to Stykker, fra øverst
      til nederst; og Jorden skjalv, og Klipperne revnede,
 52.  og Gravene åbnedes; og mange af de hensovede helliges legemer
      bleve oprejste,
 53.  og de gik ud af Gravene efter hans Opstandelse og kom ind i den
      hellige Stad og viste sig for mange.
 54.  Men da Høvedsmanden og de, som tillige med, ham holdt Vagt over
      Jesus, så Jordskælvet, og hvad der skete, frygtede de såre og
      sagde: "Sandelig, denne var Guds Søn."
 55.  Men der var mange Kvinder der, som så til i Frastand, hvilke
      havde fulgt Jesus fra Galilæa og tjent ham.
 56.  Iblandt dem vare Maria Magdalene og Maria, Jakobs og Josefs
      Moder, og Zebedæus's Sønners Moder.

 57.  Men da det var blevet Aften, kom en rig Mand fra Arimathæa, ved
      Navn Josef, som også selv var bleven Jesu Discipel.
 58.  Han gik til Pilatus og bad om Jesu Legeme. Da befalede Pilatus,
      at det skulde udleveres.
 59.  Og Josef tog Legemet og svøbte det i et rent, fint Linklæde
 60.  og lagde det i sin nye Grav, som han havde ladet hugge i
      Klippen, og væltede en stor Sten for Indgangen til Graven og gik
      bort.
 61.  Men Maria Magdalene og den anden Maria vare der, og de sade lige
      over for Graven.

 62.  Men den næste Dag, som var Dagen efter Beredelsesdagen,
      forsamlede Ypperstepræsterne og Farisæerne sig hos Pilatus
 63.  og sagde: "Herre! vi ere komne i Hu, at denne Forfører sagde,
      medens han endnu levede: Tre Dage efter bliver jeg oprejst.
 64.  Befal derfor, at Graven skal sikkert bevogtes indtil den tredje
      Dag, for at ikke hans Disciple skulle komme og stjæle ham og
      sige til Folket: "Han er oprejst fra de døde; og da vil den
      sidste Forførelse blive værre end den første,"
 65.  Pilatus sagde til dem: "Der have I en Vagt; går hen og bevogter
      den sikkert, som I bedst vide!"
 66.  Og de gik hen og bevogtede Graven sikkert med Vagten efter at
      have sat Segl for Stenen.

Matt. 28

  1.  Men efter Sabbaten, da det gryede ad den første Dag i Ugen, kom
      Maria Magdalene og den anden Maria for at se til Graven.
  2.  Og se, der skete et stort Jordskælv; thi en Herrens Engel for
      ned fra Himmelen og trådte til og væltede Stenen bort og satte
      sig på den.
  3.  Men hans Udseende var ligesom et Lyn og hans Klædebon hvidt som
      Sne.
  4.  Men de, som holdt Vagt, skælvede af Frygt for ham og bleve som
      døde.
  5.  Men Engelen tog til Orde og sagde til Kvinderne: "I skulle ikke
      frygte! thi jeg ved, at I lede efter Jesus den korsfæstede.
  6.  Han er ikke her; thi han er opstanden, som han har sagt. Kommer
      hid, ser Stedet, hvor Herren lå!
  7.  Og går hastigt hen og siger hans Disciple, at han er opstanden
      fra de døde; og se, han går forud for eder til Galilæa; der
      skulle I se ham. Se, jeg har sagt eder det."
  8.  Og de gik hastig bort fra Graven med Frygt og stor Glæde og løb
      hen for at forkynde hans Disciple det.
  9.  Men medens de gik for at forkynde hans Disciple det, se, da
      mødte Jesus dem og sagde: "Hil være eder!" Men de trådte til og
      omfavnede hans Fødder og tilbade ham.
 10.  Da siger Jesus til dem: "Frygter ikke! går hen og forkynder mine
      Brødre, at de skulle gå bort til Galilæa, og der skulle de se
      mig."

 11.  Men medens de gik derhen, se da kom nogle af Vagten ind i Staden
      og meldte Ypperstepræsterne alt det, som var sket.
 12.  Og de samledes med de Ældste og holdt Råd og gave Stridsmændene
      rigelige Penge
 13.  og sagde: "Siger: Hans Disciple kom om Natten og stjal ham,
      medens vi sov.
 14.  Og dersom Landshøvdingen får det at høre, ville vi stille ham
      tilfreds og holde eder angerløse."
 15.  Men de toge Pengene og gjorde, som det var lært dem. Og dette
      Ord blev udspredt iblandt Jøderne indtil den Dag i Dag.

 16.  Men de elleve Disciple gik til Galilæa, til det Bjerg, hvor
      Jesus havde sat dem Stævne.
 17.  Og da de så ham tilbade de ham; men nogle tvivlede.
 18.  Og Jesus trådte frem, talte til dem og sagde: "Mig er given al
      Magt i Himmelen og på Jorden.
 19.  Går derfor hen og gører alle Folkeslagene til mine Disciple,
      idet I døbe dem til Faderens og Sønnens og den Helligånds Navn,
 20.  og idet I lære dem at holde alt det, som jeg har befalet
      eder. Og se, jeg er med eder alle Dage indtil Verdens Ende."


Markus

Markus 1

  1.  Jesu Kristi, Guds Søns, Evangeliums Begyndelse er således,
  2.  som der er skrevet hos Profeten Esajas: "Se, jeg sender min
      Engel for dit Ansigt, han skal berede din Vej.
  3.  Der er en Røst af en, som råber i Ørkenen: Bereder Herrens Vej,
      gører hans Stier jævne!"
  4.  Johannes kom, han, som døbte i Ørkenen og prædikede
      Omvendelses-Dåb til Syndernes Forladelse.
  5.  Og hele Judæas Land og alle i Jerusalem gik ud og bleve døbt, af
      ham i Floden Jordan, idet de bekendte deres Synder
  6.  Og Johannes var klædt i Kamelhår og havde et Læderbælte om sin
      Lænd og spiste Græshopper og vild Honning.
  7.  Og han prædikede og sagde: "Efter mig kommer den, som er
      stærkere end jeg, hvis Skotvinge jeg ikke er værdig at bøje mig
      ned og løse.
  8.  Jeg har døbt eder med Vand, men han skal døbe eder med den
      Helligånd."

  9.  Og det skete i de dage, at Jesus kom fra Nazareth i Galilæa og
      blev døbt af Johannes i Jordan.
 10.  Og straks da han steg op af Vandet, så han Himlene skilles ad og
      Ånden ligesom en Due dale ned over ham;
 11.  og der kom en Røst fra Himlene: "Du er min Søn, den elskede, i
      dig har jeg Velbehag."

 12.  Og straks driver Ånden ham ud i Ørkenen.
 13.  Og han var i Ørkenen fyrretyve Dage, medens han fristedes af
      Satan, og han var blandt Dyrene; og Englene tjente ham.

 14.  Men efter at Johannes var kastet i Fængsel, kom Jesus til
      Galilæa og prædikede Guds Evangelium
 15.  og sagde: "Tiden er fuldkommet, og Guds Rige er kommet nær;
      omvender eder og tror på Evangeliet!"

 16.  Og medens han gik langs Galilæas Sø, så han Simon og Simons
      Broder Andreas i Færd med at kaste Garn i Søen; thi de vare
      Fiskere.
 17.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "Følger efter mig, så vil jeg gøre eder
      til Menneskefiskere."
 18.  Og de forlode straks Garnene og fulgte ham.
 19.  Og da han gik lidt videre frem, så han, Jakob, Zebedæus's Søn,
      og hans Broder Johannes, som også vare i Færd med at bøde deres
      Garn i Skibet;
 20.  og han kaldte straks på dem, og de forlode deres Fader Zebedæus
      i Skibet med Lejesvendene og gik efter ham.

 21.  Og de gå ind i Kapernaum. Og straks på Sabbaten gik han ind i
      Synagogen og lærte,
 22.  og de bleve slagne af Forundring over hans Lære; thi han lærte
      dem som en, der havde Myndighed, og ikke som de skriftkloge.
 23.  Og der var i deres Synagoge et Menneske med en uren Ånd, og han
      råbte højt
 24.  og sagde: "Hvad have vi med dig at gøre, Jesus af Nazareth? Er
      du kommen for at ødelægge os; jeg kender dig, hvem du er, du
      Guds hellige."
 25.  Og Jesus truede ham og sagde: "Ti, og far ud af ham!"
 26.  Og den urene Ånd sled i ham og råbte med høj Røst og for ud af
      ham.
 27.  Og de bleve alle forfærdede, så at de spurgte hverandre og
      sagde: "Hvad er dette? en ny Lære med Myndighed; også over de
      urene Ånder byder han, og de lyde ham."
 28.  Og Rygtet om ham kom straks ud alle Vegne i hele det omliggende
      Land i Galilæa.

 29.  Og straks, da de vare gåede ud af Synagogen, kom de ind i Simons
      og Andreas's Hus med Jakob og Johannes.
 30.  Men Simons Svigermoder lå og havde Feber, og straks tale de til
      ham om hende;
 31.  og han gik hen til hende, tog hende ved Hånden og rejste hende
      op, og Feberen forlod hende, og hun vartede dem op.
 32.  Men da det var blevet Aften, og Solen var gået ned, førte de til
      ham alle de syge og besatte,
 33.  og hele Byen var forsamlet foran Døren.
 34.  Og han helbredte mange, som lede af mange Hånde Sygdomme, og han
      uddrev mange onde Ånder; og han tillod ikke de onde Ånder at
      tale, fordi de kendte ham.

 35.  Og om Morgenen længe før Dag stod han op og gik ud og gik hen
      til et øde Sted, og der bad han:
 36.  Og Simon og de, som vare med ham, skyndte sig efter ham.
 37.  Og de fandt ham, og de sige til ham: "Alle lede efter dig."
 38.  Og han siger til dem: "Lader os gå andetsteds hen til de
      nærmeste Småbyer, for at jeg kan prædike også der; thi dertil er
      jeg udgået."
 39.  Og han kom og prædikede i deres Synagoger i hele Galilæa og
      uddrev de onde Ånder.

 40.  Og en spedalsk kommer til ham, beder ham og falder på Knæ for
      ham og siger til ham: "Om du vil, så kan du rense mig."
 41.  Og han ynkedes inderligt og udrakte Hånden og rørte ved ham og
      siger til ham: "Jeg vil; bliv ren!"
 42.  Og straks forlod Spedalskheden ham, og han blev renset.
 43.  Og han drev ham straks bort, idet han bød ham strengt
 44.  og sagde til ham: "Se til, at du ikke siger noget til nogen
      herom; men gå hen, fremstil dig selv for Præsten, og offer for
      din Renselse det, som Moses har befalet, til Vidnesbyrd for
      dem!"
 45.  Men da han kom ud, begyndte han at fortælle meget og udsprede
      Rygtet derom, så at han ikke mere kunde gå åbenlyst ind i en By;
      men han var udenfor på øde Steder, og de kom til ham alle Vegne
      fra.

Markus 2

  1.  Og da han nogle Dage derefter atter gik ind i Kapernaum,
      spurgtes det, at han var hjemme.
  2.  Og der samledes mange, så at der ikke mere var Plads, end ikke
      foran Døren; og han talte Ordet til dem.
  3.  Og de komme og bringe til ham en værkbruden, der blev båren af
      fire.
  4.  Og da de ikke kunde komme nær til ham for Folkeskaren, toge de
      Taget af, hvor han var; og da de havde brudt Hul, firede de
      Sengen ned, hvorpå den værkbrudne lå.
  5.  Og da Jesus så deres Tro, siger han til den værkbrudne: "Søn!
      dine Synder ere forladte."
  6.  Men nogle af de skriftkloge sade der og tænkte i deres Hjerter:
  7.  "Hvorfor taler denne således.? Han taler bespotteligt. Hvem kan
      forlade Synder uden een, nemlig Gud?"
  8.  Og Jesus kendte straks i sin Ånd, at de tænkte således ved sig
      selv, og sagde til dem: "Hvorfor tænke I dette i eders Hjerter?
  9.  Hvilket er lettest, at sige til den værkbrudne: Dine Synder ere
      forladte, eller at sige: Stå op, og tag din Seng, og gå?
 10.  Men for at I skulle vide, at Menneskesønnen har Magt på Jorden
      til at forlade Synder," siger han til den værkbrudne:
 11.  "Jeg siger dig: Stå op, tag din Seng, og gå til dit Hus!"
 12.  Og han stod op og tog straks Sengen og gik ud for alles Øjne, så
      de alle bleve forfærdede og priste Gud og sagde: "Aldrig have vi
      set noget sådant."

 13.  Og han gik atter ud langs Søen, og hele Skaren kom til ham, og
      han lærte dem.
 14.  Og da han gik forbi, så han Levi, Alfæus's Søn sidde ved
      Toldboden, og han siger til ham: "Følg mig!" Og han stod op og
      fulgte ham.
 15.  Og det skete, at han sad til Bords i hans Hus, og mange Toldere
      og Syndere sade til Bords med Jesus, og hans Disciple; thi de
      vare mange. Og der fulgte også
 16.  nogle skriftkloge af Farisæerne med ham, og da de så, at han
      spiste med Toldere og Syndere, sagde de til hans Disciple: "Han
      spiser og drikker med Toldere og Syndere!"
 17.  Og da Jesus hørte det, siger han til dem: "De raske trænge ikke
      til Læge, men de syge. Jeg er ikke kommen for at kalde
      retfærdige, men Syndere."

 18.  Og Johannes's Disciple og Farisæerne fastede, og de komme og
      sige til ham: "Hvorfor faste Johannes's Disciple og Farisæernes
      Disciple, men dine Disciple faste ikke?"
 19.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "Kunne Brudesvendene faste, medens
      Brudgommen er hos dem? Så længe de have Brudgommen hos sig kunne
      de ikke faste.
 20.  Men der skal komme Dage, da Brudgommen bliver tagen fra dem, da
      skulle de faste på den Dag.
 21.  Ingen syr en Lap af uvalket Klæde på et gammelt Klædebon; ellers
      river den nye Lap på det gamle Klædebon dette itu, og der bliver
      et værre Hul.
 22.  Og ingen kommer ung Vin på gamle Læderflasker; ellers sprænger
      Vinen Læderflaskerne, og Vinen ødelægges såvel som
      Læderflaskerne; men kom ung Vin på nye Læderflasker!"

 23.  Og det skete, at han vandrede på Sabbaten igennem en Sædemark,
      og hans Disciple begyndte, imedens de gik, at plukke Aks.
 24.  Og Farisæerne sagde til ham: "Se, hvorfor gøre de på Sabbaten,
      hvad der ikke er tilladt?"
 25.  Og han siger til dem "Have I aldrig læst, hvad David gjorde, da
      han kom i Nød og blev hungrig, han selv og de, som vare med ham?
 26.  Hvorledes han gik ind i Guds Hus, da Abiathar var Ypperstepræst,
      og spiste Skuebrødene, som det ikke er nogen tilladt at spise
      uden Præsterne, og gav også dem, som vare med ham?"
 27.  Og han sagde til dem: "Sabbaten blev til for Menneskets Skyld og
      ikke Mennesket for Sabbatens Skyld.
 28.  Derfor er Menneskesønnen Herre også over Sabbaten."

Markus 3

  1.  Og han, gik atter ind i en Synagoge, og der var der en Mand, som
      havde en vissen Hånd.
  2.  Og de toge Vare på ham, om han vilde helbrede ham på Sabbaten,
      for at de kunde anklage ham.
  3.  Og han siger til Manden, som havde den visne Hånd!"Træd frem her
      i Midten!"
  4.  Og han siger til dem: "Er det tilladt at gøre godt på Sabbaten
      eller at gøre ondt, at frelse Liv eller at slå ihjel?" Men de
      tav.
  5.  Og han så omkring på dem med Vrede, bedrøvet over deres Hjertes
      Forhærdelse, og siger til Manden: "Ræk din Hånd ud!" og han
      rakte den ud, og hans Hånd blev sund igen.
  6.  Og Farisæerne gik straks ud og holdt Råd med Herodianerne imod
      ham, hvorledes de kunde slå ham ihjel.

  7.  Og Jesus drog med sine Disciple bort til Søen, og en stor Mængde
      fulgte med fra Galilæa; og fra Judæa
  8.  og fra Jerusalem og fra Idumæa og Landet hinsides Jordan og fra
      Egnen om Tyrus og Sidon kom de til ham i stor Mængde, da de
      hørte, hvor store Gerninger han gjorde.
  9.  Og han sagde til sine Disciple, at en Båd skulde være til Rede
      til ham for Skarens Skyld, for at de ikke skulde trænge ham.
 10.  Thi han helbredte mange, så at alle, som havde Plager, styrtede
      ind på ham for at røre ved ham.
 11.  Og når de urene Ånder så ham, faldt de ned for ham og råbte og
      sagde: "Du er Guds Søn."
 12.  Og han truede dem meget, at de ikke måtte gøre ham kendt.

 13.  Og han stiger op på Bjerget og hidkalder, hvem han selv vilde;
      og de gik hen til ham.
 14.  Og han beskikkede tolv, til at de skulde være hos ham, og til at
      han kunde udsende dem til at prædike
 15.  og at have Magt til at uddrive de onde Ånder.
 16.  Og han beskikkede de tolv, og han tillagde Simon Navnet Peter;
 17.  fremdeles Jakob, Zebedæus's Søn, og Johannes, Jakobs Broder, og
      han tillagde dem Navnet Boanerges, det er Tordensønner;
 18.  og Andreas og Filip og Bartholomæus og Matthæus og Thomas og
      Jakob, Alfæus's Søn, og Thaddæus og Simon Kananæeren
 19.  og Judas Iskariot, han, som forrådte ham.

 20.  Og han kommer hjem, og der samles atter en Skare, så at de end
      ikke kunne få Mad.
 21.  Og da hans nærmeste hørte det, gik de ud for at drage ham til
      sig thi de sagde: "Han er ude af sig selv."
 22.  Og de skriftkloge, som vare komne ned fra Jerusalem, sagde: "Han
      har Beelzebul, og ved de onde Ånders Fyrste uddriver han de onde
      Ånder:"
 23.  Og han kaldte dem til sig og sagde til dem i Lignelser:
      "Hvorledes kan Satan uddrive Satan?
 24.  Og dersom et Rige er kommet i Splid med sig selv, kan samme Rige
      ikke bestå.
 25.  Og dersom et Hus er kommet i Splid med sig selv, vil samme Hus
      ikke kunne bestå.
 26.  Og dersom Satan har sat sig op imod sig selv og er kommen i
      Splid med sig selv, kan han ikke bestå, men det er ude med ham.
 27.  Men ingen kan gå ind i den stærkes Hus og røve hans Ejendele,
      uden han først binder den stærke, og da kan han plyndre hans
      Hus.
 28.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, alle Ting skulle forlades Menneskenes
      Børn, Synder og Bespottelser, hvor store Bespottelser de end
      tale;
 29.  men den. som taler bespotteligt imod den Helligånd, har
      evindeligt ingen Forladelse, men skal være skyldig i en evig
      Synd."
 30.  De sagde nemlig: "Han har en uren Ånd."

 31.  Og hans Moder,og hans Brødre komme, og de stode udenfor og
      sendte Bud ind til ham og lode ham kalde.
 32.  Og en Skare sad omkring ham; og de sige til ham: "Se; din Moder
      og dine; Brødre og dine Søstre ere udenfor og spørge efter dig."
 33.  Og han svarer dem og siger: "Hvem er min Moder og mine Brødre?"
 34.  Og han så omkring på dem, som sade rundt om ham, og sagde: "Se,
      her er min Moder og mine Brødre!
 35.  Thi den, som gør Guds Villie, det er min Broder og Søster og
      Moder."

Markus 4

  1.  Og han begyndte atter at lære ved søen. Og en meget stor Skare
      samles om ham, så at han måtte gå om Bord og sætte sig i et Skib
      på Søen; og hele Skaren var på Land ved Søen.
  2.  Og han lærte dem meget i Lignelser og sagde til dem i sin
      Undervisning:
  3.  "Hører til: Se, en Sædemand gik ud at så.
  4.  Og det skete, idet han såede, at noget faldt ved Vejen, og
      Fuglene kom og åde det op.
  5.  Og noget faldt på Stengrund, hvor det ikke havde megen Jord; og
      det voksede straks op, fordi det ikke havde dyb Jord.
  6.  Og da Solen kom op, blev det svedet af, og fordi det ikke havde
      Rod, visnede det.
  7.  Og noget faldt iblandt Torne, og Tornene voksede op og kvalte
      det, og det bar ikke Frugt.
  8.  Og noget faldt i god Jord og bar Frugt, som skød frem og
      voksede, og det bar tredive og tresindstyve og hundrede Fold."
  9.  Og han sagde: "Den som har Øren at høre med, han høre!"

 10.  Og da han blev ene, spurgte de, som vare om ham, tillige med de
      tolv ham om Lignelserne.
 11.  Og han sagde til dem: "Eder er Guds Riges Hemmelighed givet; men
      dem, som ere udenfor, meddeles alt ved Lignelser,
 12.  for at de, skønt seende, skulle se og ikke indse og, skønt
      hørende, skulle høre og ikke forstå, for at de ikke skulle
      omvende sig og få Forladelse "

 13.  Og han siger til dem: "Fatte I ikke denne Lignelse? Hvorledes
      ville I da forstå alle de andre Lignelser?
 14.  Sædemanden sår Ordet.
 15.  Men de ved Vejen, det er dem, hvor Ordet bliver sået, og når de
      høre det, kommer straks Satan og borttager Ordet,som er sået i
      dem.
 16.  Og ligeledes de, som blive såede på Stengrunden, det er dem,
      som, når de høre Ordet, straks modtage det med Glæde;
 17.  og de have ikke Rod i sig, men holde kun ud til en Tid;
      derefter, når der kommer Trængsel eller forfølgelse for Ordets
      Skyld, forarges de straks.
 18.  Og andre ere de, som blive såede blandt Torne; det er dem, som
      have hørt Ordet
 19.  og denne Verdens Bekymringer og Rigdommens Forførelse og
      Begæringerne efter de andre Ting komme ind og kvæle Ordet, så
      det bliver uden Frugt.
 20.  Og de, der bleve såede i god Jord, det er dem, som høre Ordet og
      modtage det og bære Frugt,tredive og tresindstyve og hundrede
      Fold."

 21.  Og han sagde til dem: "Mon Lyset kommer ind for at sættes under
      Skæppen eller under, Bænken? Mon ikke for at sættes på
      Lysestagen?
 22.  Thi ikke er noget skjult uden for at åbenbares; ej heller er det
      blevet lønligt uden for at komme for Lyset.
 23.  Dersom nogen har Øren at høre med, han høre!"
 24.  Og han sagde til dem: "Agter på, hvad I høre! Med hvad Mål I
      måle, skal der tilmåles eder, og der skal gives eder end mere.
 25.  Thi den, som har, ham skal der gives; og den, som ikke har, fra
      ham skal endog det tages, som han har."

 26.  Og han sagde: "Med Guds Rige er det således, som når en Mand har
      lagt Sæden i Jorden
 27.  og sover og står op Nat og Dag, og Sæden spirer og bliver høj,
      han ved ej selv hvorledes.
 28.  Af sig selv bærer Jorden Frugt, først Strå, derefter Aks,
      derefter fuld Kærne i Akset;
 29.  men når Frugten er tjenlig, sender han straks Seglen ud; thi
      Høsten er for Hånden."

 30.  Og han sagde: "Hvormed skulle vi ligne Guds Rige, eller under
      hvilken Lignelse skulle vi fremstille det?
 31.  Det er som et Sennepskorn, som, når det sås i Jorden, er mindre
      end alt andet Frø på Jorden,
 32.  og når det er sået, vokser det op og bliver større end alle
      Urterne og skyder store Grene, så at Himmelens Fugle kunne bygge
      Rede i dets Skygge."
 33.  Og i mange sådanne Lignelser talte han Ordet til dem, efter som
      de kunde fatte det.
 34.  Men uden Lignelse talte han ikke til dem; men i Enerum udlagde
      han det alt sammen for sine Disciple.

 35.  Og på den Dag, da det var blevet Aften, siger han til dem:
      "Lader os fare over til hin Side!"
 36.  Og de forlade Folkeskaren og tage ham med, som ham sad i Skibet;
      men der var også andre Skibe med ham.
 37.  Og der kommer en stærk Stormvind, og Bølgerne sloge ind i
      Skibet, så at Skibet allerede var ved at fyldes.
 38.  Og han var i Bagstavnen og sov på en Hovedpude, og de vække ham
      og sige til ham: "Mester! bryder du dig ikke om, at vi forgå?"
 39.  Og han stod op og truede Vinden og sagde til Søen: "Ti, vær
      stille!" og Vinden lagde sig, og det blev ganske blikstille.
 40.  Og han sagde til dem: "Hvorfor ere I så bange? Hvorfor have I
      ikke Tro?"
 41.  Og de frygtede såre og sagde til hverandre: "Hvem er dog denne
      siden både Vinden og Søen ere ham lydige?"

Markus 5

  1.  Og de kom over til hin Side af Søen til Gerasenernes Land.
  2.  Og da han trådte ud af Skibet, kom der ham straks i Møde ud fra
      Gravene en Mand med en uren Ånd.
  3.  Han havde sin Bolig i Gravene, og ingen kunde længer binde ham,
      end ikke med Lænker.
  4.  Thi han havde ofte været bunden med Bøjer og Lænker, og Lænkerne
      vare sprængte af ham og Bøjerne sønderslidte, og ingen kunde
      tæmme ham.
  5.  Og han var altid Nat og Dag i Gravene og på Bjergene, skreg og
      slog sig selv med Sten.
  6.  Men da han så Jesus. Langt borte, løb han hen og kastede sig ned
      for ham
  7.  og råbte med høj Røst og sagde: "Hvad har jeg med dig at gøre,
      Jesus, den højeste Guds Søn? Jeg besvæger dig ved Gud, at du
      ikke piner mig."
  8.  Thi han sagde til ham: "Far ud af Manden, du urene Ånd!"
  9.  Og han spurgte ham: "Hvad er dit Navn?" Og han siger til ham:
      "Legion er mit Navn; thi vi ere mange."
 10.  Og han bad ham meget om ikke at drive dem ud af Landet.
 11.  Men der var der ved Bjerget en stor Hjord Svin, som græssede;
 12.  og de bade ham og sagde: "Send os i Svinene, så vi må fare i
      dem."
 13.  Og han tilstedte dem det. Og de urene Ånder fore ud og fore i
      Svinene; og Hjorden styrtede sig ned over Brinken ud i Søen,
      omtrent to Tusinde, og de druknede i Søen
 14.  Og deres Hyrder flyede og forkyndte det i Byen og på Landet; og
      de kom for at se, hvad det var, som var sket.
 15.  Og de komme til Jesus og se den besatte, ham, som havde haft
      Legionen, sidde påklædt og ved Samling, og de frygtede.
 16.  Men de, som havde set det, fortalte dem, hvorledes det var gået
      den besatte, og om Svinene.
 17.  Og de begyndte at bede ham om, at han vilde gå bort fra deres
      Egn.
 18.  Og da han gik om Bord i Skibet, bad den, som havde været besat,
      ham om, at han måtte være hos ham.
 19.  Og han tilstedte ham det ikke, men siger til ham: "Gå til dit
      Hus, til dine egne, og forkynd dem, hvor store Ting Herren har
      gjort imod dig, og at han har forbarmet sig over dig."
 20.  Og han gik bort og begyndte at kundgøre i Bekapolis, hvor store
      Ting Jesus havde gjort imod ham; og alle undrede sig.

 21.  Og da Jesus igen i Skibet var faren over til hin Side, samledes
      der en stor Skare om ham, og han var ved Søen.
 22.  Og der kommer en af Synagogeforstanderne ved Navn Jairus, og da
      han ser ham, falder han ned for hans Fødder.
 23.  Og han beder ham meget og siger: "Min lille Datter er på sit
      yderste; o! at du vilde komme og lægge Hænderne på hende, for at
      hun må frelses og leve!"
 24.  Og han gik bort med ham, og en stor Skare fulgte ham, og de
      trængte ham.
 25.  Og der var en Kvinde, som havde haft Blodflod i tolv År,
 26.  og hun havde døjet meget af mange Læger og havde tilsat alt,
      hvad hun ejede, og hun var ikke bleven hjulpen, men tværtimod,
      det var blevet værre med hende.
 27.  Da hun havde hørt om Jesus, kom hun bagfra i Skaren og rørte ved
      hans Klædebon.
 28.  Thi hun sagde: "Dersom jeg rører blot ved hans Klæder, bliver
      jeg frelst."
 29.  Og straks tørredes hendes Blods Kilde, og hun mærkede i sit
      Legeme, at hun var bleven helbredt fra sin Plage.
 30.  Og straks da Jesus mærkede på sig selv, at den Kraft var udgået
      fra ham, vendte han sig om i Skaren og sagde: "Hvem rørte ved
      mine Klæder?"
 31.  Og hans Disciple sagde til ham: "Du ser, at Skaren trænger dig,
      og du siger: Hvem rørte ved mig?"
 32.  Og han så sig om for at se hende, som havde gjort dette.
 33.  Men da Kvinden vidste, hvad der var sket hende, kom hun
      frygtende og bævende og faldt ned for ham og sagde ham hele
      Sandheden.
 34.  Men han sagde til hende: "Datter! din Tro har frelst dig; gå
      bort med Fred, og vær helbredt fra din Plage!"
 35.  Endnu medens han talte, komme nogle fra Synagogeforstanderens
      Hus og sige: "Din Datter er død, hvorfor umager du Mesteren
      længere?"
 36.  Men Jesus hørte det Ord, som blev sagt, og han siger til
      Synagogeforstanderen: "Frygt ikke, tro blot!"
 37.  Og han tilstedte ingen at følge med sig uden Peter og Jakob og
      Johannes, Jakobs Broder.
 38.  Og de komme ind i Synagogeforstanderens Hus, og han ser en
      larmende Hob, der græd og hylede meget.
 39.  Og han går ind og siger til dem: "Hvorfor larme og græde I?
      Barnet er ikke død, men det sover."
 40.  Og de lo ad ham; men han drev dem alle ud, og han tager Barnets
      Fader og Moder og sine Ledsagere med sig og går ind, hvor Barnet
      var.
 41.  Og han tager Barnet ved Hånden og siger til hende: "Talitha
      kumi!" hvilket er udlagt: "Pige, jeg siger dig, stå op!"
 42.  Og straks stod Pigen op og gik omkring; thi hun var tolv År
      gammel. Og de bleve straks overmåde forfærdede
 43.  Og han bød dem meget, at ingen måtte få dette at vide; og han
      sagde, at de skulde give hende noget at spise.

Markus 6

  1.  Og han gik bort derfra Og han kommer til sin Fædreneby, og hans
      Disciple følge ham.
  2.  Og da det blev Sabbat, begyndte han at lære i Synagogen, og de
      mange, som hørte ham, bleve slagne af Forundring og sagde:
      "Hvorfra har han dog dette, og hvad er det for en Visdom, som er
      given ham,og hvilke kraftige Gerninger der dog sker ved hans
      Hænder!
  3.  Er denne ikke Tømmermanden, Marias Søn og Jakobs og Joses's og
      Judas's og Simons Broder? Og ere ikke hans Søstre her hos os?"
      Og de forargedes på ham.
  4.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "En Profet er ikke foragtet uden i sit
      eget Fædreland og iblandt sine Slægtninge og i sit Hus."
  5.  Og han kunde ikke gøre nogen kraftig Gerning der; kun lagde han
      Hænderne på nogle få syge og helbredte dem
  6.  Og han forundrede sig over deres Vantro. Og han gik om i
      Landsbyerne der omkring og lærte.

  7.  Og han hidkalder de tolv, og han begyndte at udsende dem, to og
      to, og gav dem Magt over de urene Ånder.
  8.  Og han bød dem, at de skulde intet tage med på Vejen uden en
      Stav alene, ikke Brød, ikke Taske, ikke Kobber i Bæltet,
  9.  men have Sko på og: "Ifører eder ikke to Kjortler!"
 10.  Og han sagde til dem: "Hvor I komme ind i et Hus, der skulle I
      blive, indtil I drage bort fra Stedet.
 11.  Og hvor man ikke vil modtage eder og ikke vil høre eder, der
      skulle I gå bort fra og afryste Støvet under eders Fødder til
      Vidnesbyrd imod dem."
 12.  Og de gik ud og prædikede, at man skulde omvende sig.
 13.  Og de dreve onde Ånder ud og salvede mange syge med Olie og
      helbredte dem.

 14.  Og Kong Herodes hørte det (thi hans Navn var blevet bekendt), og
      han sagde: "Johannes Døberen er oprejst fra de døde, og derfor
      virke Kræfterne i ham."
 15.  Andre sagde: "Det er Elias; " men andre sagde: "Det er en Profet
      ligesom en af Profeterne."
 16.  Men da Herodes hørte det, sagde han: "Johannes, som jeg har
      ladet halshugge, han er oprejst."
 17.  Thi Herodes havde selv sendt Bud og ladet Johannes gribe og
      kaste i Fængsel for sin Broder Filips Hustru, Herodias's Skyld;
      thi han havde taget hende til Ægte.
 18.  Johannes sagde nemlig til Herodes: "Det er dig ikke tilladt at
      have din Broders Hustru."
 19.  Men Herodias bar Nag til ham og vilde gerne slå ham ihjel, og
      hun kunde det ikke.
 20.  Thi Herodes frygtede for Johannes, fordi han vidste, at han var
      en retfærdig og hellig Mand, og han holdt sin Hånd over ham; og
      når han hørte ham, var han tvivlrådig om mange Ting, og han
      hørte ham gerne.
 21.  Og da der kom en belejlig Dag, da Herodes på sin Fødselsdag
      gjorde et Gæstebud for sine Stormænd og Krigsøversterne og de
      ypperste i Galilæa,
 22.  og da selve Herodias's Datter kom ind og dansede, behagede hun
      Herodes og Gæsterne. Og Kongen sagde til Pigen: "Bed mig, om
      hvad som helst du vil, så vil jeg give dig det."
 23.  Og han svor hende til og sagde: "Hvad som helst du beder om, vil
      jeg give dig, indtil Halvdelen af mit Rige."
 24.  Og hun gik ud og sagde til sin Moder: "Hvad skal jeg bede om?"
      Men hun sagde: "Om Johannes Døberens Hoved."
 25.  Og hun gik straks skyndsomt ind til Kongen, bad og sagde: "Jeg
      vil, at du straks giver mig Johannes Døberens Hoved på et Fad."
 26.  Om end Kongen blev meget bedrøvet, vilde han dog for Edernes og
      Gæsternes Skyld ikke afvise hende:
 27.  Og Kongen sendte straks en at Vagten og befalede at bringe hans
      Hoved
 28.  Og denne gik hen og halshuggede ham i Fængselet; og han bragte
      hans Hoved på et Fad og gav det til Pigen, og Pigen gav det til
      sin Moder.
 29.  Og da hans Disciple hørte det, kom de og toge hans Lig og lagde
      det i en Grav.

 30.  Og Apostlene samle sig om Jesus, og de forkyndte ham alt, hvad
      de havde gjort, og hvad de havde lært.
 31.  Og han siger til dem: "Kommer nu I med afsides til et øde Sted
      og hviler eder lidt;" thi der var mange, som gik til og fra, og
      de havde ikke engang Ro til at spise.
 32.  Og de droge bort i Skibet til et øde Sted afsides.
 33.  Og man så dem drage bort, og mange kendte dem, og til Fods
      strømmede de sammen derhen fra alle Byerne og kom før end de.
 34.  Og da han gik i Land, så han en stor Skare, og han ynkedes
      inderligt over dem; thi de vare som Får, der ikke have Hyrde; og
      han begyndte at lære dem meget.
 35.  Og da Tiden allerede var fremrykket, kom hans Disciple til ham
      og sagde: "Stedet er øde, og Tiden er allerede fremrykket.
 36.  Lad dem gå bort, for at de kunne gå hen i de omliggende Gårde og
      Landsbyer og købe sig noget at spise."
 37.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Giver I dem at spise!" Og de
      sige til ham: "Skulle vi gå hen og købe Brød for to Hundrede
      Denarer og give dem at spise?"
 38.  Men han siger til dem: "Hvor mange Brød have I? Går hen og ser
      efter!" Og da de havde fået det at vide, sige de: "Fem, og to
      Fisk."
 39.  Og han bød dem at lade dem alle sætte sig ned i små Flokke i det
      grønne Græs.
 40.  Og de satte sig ned, Hob ved Hob, somme på hundrede og somme på
      halvtredsindstyve.
 41.  Og han tog de fem Brød og de to Fisk, så op til Himmelen og
      velsignede; og han brød Brødene og gav sine Disciple dem at
      lægge for dem, og han delte de to Fisk til dem alle.
 42.  Og de spiste alle og bleve mætte.
 43.  Og de optoge tolv Kurve fulde af Stykker, også af Fiskene.
 44.  Og de, som spiste Brødene, vare fem Tusinde Mænd.

 45.  Og straks nødte han sine Disciple til at gå om Bord i Skibet og
      i Forvejen sætte over til hin Side, til Bethsajda, medens han
      selv lod Skaren gå bort.
 46.  Og da han havde taget Afsked med dem, gik han op på Bjerget for
      at bede.
 47.  Og da det var blevet silde, var Skibet midt på Søen og han alene
      på Landjorden.
 48.  Og da han så, at de havde deres Nød med at ro (thi Vinden var
      dem imod); kommer han ved den fjerde Nattevagt til dem vandrende
      på Søen. Og han vilde gå dem forbi.
 49.  Men da de så ham vandre på Søen, mente de, at det var et
      Spøgelse, og de skrege.
 50.  Thi de så ham alle og bleve forfærdede. Men han talte straks med
      dem og sagde til dem: "Værer frimodige, det er mig, frygter
      ikke!"
 51.  Og han steg op i Skibet til dem, og Vinden lagde sig, og de
      forfærdedes over al Måde ved sig selv.
 52.  Thi de havde ikke fået Forstand af det, som var sket med
      Brødene; men deres Hjerte var forhærdet

 53.  Og da de vare farne over til Landet, kom de til Genezareth og
      lagde til der.
 54.  Og da de trådte ud af Skibet, kendte man ham straks.
 55.  Og de løb om i hele den Egn og begyndte at bringe de syge på
      deres Senge omkring, hvor de hørte, at han var.
 56.  Og hvor som helst han gik ind i Landsbyer eller Byer eller
      Gårde, lagde de de syge på Torvene og bade ham om, at de måtte
      røre blot ved Fligen af hans Klædebon; og alle de, som rørte ved
      ham, bleve helbredte.

Markus 7

  1.  Og Farisæerne og nogle af de skriftkloge, som vare komne fra
      Jerusalem, samle sig om ham.
  2.  Og da de så nogle af hans Disciple holde Måltid med vanhellige,
      det er utoede, Hænder
  3.  thi Farisæerne og alle Jøderne spise ikke uden at to Hænderne
      omhyggeligt, idet de fastholde de gamles Overlevering;
  4.  og når de komme fra Torvet, spise de ikke uden først at tvætte
      sig; og der er mange andre Ting, som de have vedtaget at holde,
      Tvætninger af Bægere og Krus og Kobberkar og Bænke,
  5.  så spurgte Farisæerne og de skriftkloge ham ad: "Hvorfor vandre
      dine Disciple ikke efter de gamles Overlevering, men holde
      Måltid med vanhellige Hænder?"
  6.  Men han sagde til dem: "Rettelig profeterede Esajas om eder, I
      Hyklere! som der er skrevet: "Dette Folk ærer mig med Læberne,
      men deres Hjerte er langt borte fra mig.
  7.  Men de dyrke mig forgæves, idet de lære Lærdomme, som ere
      Menneskers Bud."
  8.  I forlade Guds Bud og holde Menneskers Overlevering."
  9.  Og han sagde til dem: "Smukt ophæve I Guds Bud, for at I kunne
      holde eders Overlevering.
 10.  Thi Moses har sagt: "Ær din Fader og din Moder"; og:"Den, som
      hader Fader eller Moder, skal visselig dø".
 11.  Men I sige: Når en Mand siger til sin Fader eller sin Moder:
      "Det, hvormed du skulde være hjulpen af mig, skal være Korban
      (det er: Tempelgave),"
 12.  da tilstede I ham ikke mere at gøre noget for sin Fader eller
      Moder,
 13.  idet I ophæve Guds Ord ved eders Overlevering, som I have
      overleveret; og mange lignende Ting gøre I."
 14.  Og han kaldte atter Folkeskaren til sig og sagde til dem: "Hører
      mig alle, og forstår!
 15.  Der er intet uden for Mennesket, som, når det går ind i ham, kan
      gøre ham uren; men hvad der går ud af Mennesket, det er det, som
      gør Mennesket urent.
 16.  Dersom nogen har Øren at høre med, han høre!"
 17.  Og da han var gået ind i Huset og var borte fra Skaren, spurgte
      hans Disciple ham om Lignelsen.
 18.  Og han siger til dem: "Ere også I så uforstandige? Forstå I
      ikke, at intet, som udefra går ind i Mennesket, kan gøre ham
      uren?
 19.  Thi det går ikke ind i hans Hjerte men i hans Bug og går ud ad
      den naturlige Vej, og således renses al Maden."
 20.  Men han sagde: "Det, som går ud af Mennesket, dette gør
      Mennesket urent.
 21.  Thi indvortes fra, fra Menneskenes Hjerte, udgå de onde Tanker,
      Utugt, Tyveri, Mord,
 22.  Hor, Havesyge, Ondskab, Svig, Uterlighed, et ondt Øje,
      Forhånelse, Hovmod, Fremfusenhed;
 23.  alle disse onde Ting udgå indvortes fra og gøre Mennesket
      urent."

 24.  Og han stod op og gik bort derfra til Tyrus's og Sidons Egne. Og
      han gik ind i et Hus og vilde ikke, at nogen skulde vide det. Og
      han kunde dog ikke være skjult;
 25.  men en Kvinde, hvis lille Datter havde en uren Ånd, havde hørt
      om ham og kom straks ind og faldt ned for hans Fødder;
 26.  (men Kvinden var græsk, af Herkomst en Syrofønikerinde), og hun
      bad ham om, at han vilde uddrive den onde Ånd af hendes Datter.
 27.  Og han sagde til hende: "Lad først Børnene mættes; thi det er
      ikke smukt at tage Børnenes Brød og kaste det for de små Hunde."
 28.  Men hun svarede og siger til ham: "Jo, Herre! også de små Hunde
      æde under Bordet af Børnenes Smuler."
 29.  Og han sagde til hende: "For dette Ords Skyld gå bort; den onde
      Ånd er udfaren af din Datter"
 30.  Og hun gik bort til sit Hus og fandt Barnet liggende på Sengen
      og den onde Ånd udfaren.

 31.  Og da han gik bort igen fra Tyrus's Egne, kom han over Sidon
      midt igennem Dekapolis's Egne til Galilæas Sø.
 32.  Og de bringe ham en døv, som også vanskeligt kunde tale, og bede
      ham om, at han vilde lægge Hånden på ham.
 33.  Og han tog ham afsides fra Skaren og lagde sine Fingre i hans
      Øren og spyttede og rørte ved hans Tunge
 34.  og så op til Himmelen, sukkede og sagde til ham: "Effata!" det
      er: lad dig op!
 35.  Og hans Øren åbnedes, og straks løstes hans Tunges Bånd, og han
      talte ret.
 36.  Og han bød dem, at de ikke måtte sige det til nogen; men jo mere
      han bød dem, desto mere kundgjorde de det.
 37.  Og de bleve over al Måde slagne af Forundring og sagde: "Han har
      gjort alle Ting vel; både gør han, at de døve høre, og at
      målløse tale."

Markus 8

  1.  I de Dage da der atter var en stor Skare, og de intet havde at
      spise, kaldte han sine Disciple til sig og siger til dem:
  2.  "Jeg ynkes inderligt over Skaren; thi de have allerede tøvet hos
      mig i tre Dage og have intet at spise.
  3.  Og dersom jeg lader dem gå fastende hjem, ville de vansmægte på
      Vejen, og nogle af dem ere komne langvejsfra."
  4.  Og hans Disciple svarede ham: "Hvorfra skal nogen kunne mætte
      disse med Brød her i en Ørken?"
  5.  Og han spurgte dem: "Hvor mange Brød have I?" Og de sagde:"Syv."
  6.  Og han byder Skaren af sætte sig ned på Jorden; og han tog de
      syv Brød, takkede, brød, dem og gav sine Disciple dem, at de
      skulde lægge dem for; og de lagde dem for Skaren.
  7.  Og de havde nogle få Småfisk; og han velsignede dem og sagde, af
      også disse skulde lægges for.
  8.  Og de spiste og bleve mætte; og de opsamlede af tiloversblevne
      Stykker syv Kurve.
  9.  Men de vare omtrent fire Tusinde; og han lod dem gå bort.

 10.  Og straks gik han om Bord i Skibet med sine Disciple og kom til
      Dalmanuthas Egne.
 11.  Og Farisæerne gik ud og begyndte at strides med ham og forlangte
      af ham et Tegn fra Himmelen for at friste ham.
 12.  Og han sukkede dybt i sin Ånd og siger: "Hvorfor forlanger denne
      Slægt et Tegn? Sandelig, siger jeg eder, der skal ikke gives
      denne Slægt noget Tegn!"
 13.  Og han forlod dem og gik atter om Bord og for over til hin Side.

 14.  Og de havde glemt at tage Brød med og havde kun eet Brød med sig
      i Skibet.
 15.  Og han bød dem og sagde: "Ser til, tager eder i Vare for
      Farisæernes Surdejg og Herodes's Surdejg!"
 16.  Og de tænkte med hverandre: "Det er, fordi vi ikke have Brød."
 17.  Og da han mærkede dette, siger han til dem: "Hvorfor tænke I på,
      at I ikke have Brød? Skønne I ikke endnu, og forstå I ikke? Er
      eders Hjerte forhærdet?
 18.  Have I Øjne og se ikke? Og have I Øren og høre ikke? Og komme I
      ikke i Hu?
 19.  Da jeg brød de fem Brød til de fem Tusinde, hvor mange Kurve
      fulde af Stykker toge I da op?" De sige til ham: "Tolv."
 20.  "Og da jeg brød de syv til de fire Tusinde, hvor mange Kurve
      fulde af Stykker toge I da op?" Og de sige til ham: "Syv."
 21.  Og han sagde til dem "Hvorledes forstå I da ikke?"

 22.  Og de komme til Bethsajda. Og man fører en blind til ham og
      beder ham om, at han vil røre ved ham.
 23.  Og han tog den blinde ved Hånden og førte ham uden for Landsbyen
      og spyttede på hans Øjne og lagde Hænderne på ham og spurgte
      ham, om han så noget.
 24.  Og han så op og sagde: "Jeg ser Menneskene; thi jeg ser noget
      ligesom Træer gå omkring."
 25.  Derefter lagde han atter Hænderne på hans Øjne, og han blev
      klarsynet og var helbredt og kunde se alle Ting tydeligt.
 26.  Og han sendte ham hjem og sagde: "Du må ikke gå ind i Landsbyen,
      ej heller sige det til nogen i Landsbyen."

 27.  Og Jesus og hans Disciple gik ud til Landsbyerne ved Kæsarea
      Filippi; og på Vejen spurgte han sine Disciple og sagde til dem:
      "Hvem sige Menneskene, at jeg er?"
 28.  Og de sagde til ham: "Johannes Døberen; og andre: Elias; men
      andre: en af Profeterne."
 29.  Og han spurgte dem: "Men I, hvem sige I, at jeg er?" Peter
      svarede og siger til ham: "Du er Kristus."
 30.  Og han bød dem strengt,at de ikke måtte sige nogen dette om ham.

 31.  Og han begyndte at lære dem, at Menneskesønnen skulde lide meget
      og forkastes af de Ældste og Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge
      og ihjelslås og opstå efter tre Dage.
 32.  Og han talte dette frit ud. Og Peter tog ham til Side og
      begyndte at sætte ham i Rette.
 33.  Men han vendte sig og så på sine Disciple og irettesatte Peter
      og siger: "Vig bag mig, Satan! thi du sanser ikke, hvad Guds er,
      men hvad Menneskers er."

 34.  Og han kaldte Skaren tillige med sine Disciple til sig og sagde
      til dem: "Den, som vil følge efter mig, han fornægte sig selv og
      tage sit Kors op og følge mig!
 35.  Thi den, som vil frelse sit Liv, skal miste det; men den, som
      mister sit Liv for min og Evangeliets Skyld, han skal frelse
      det.
 36.  Thi hvad gavner det et Menneske at vinde den hele Verden og at
      bøde med sin Sjæl?
 37.  Thi hvad kunde et Menneske give til Vederlag for sin Sjæl?
 38.  Thi den, som skammer sig ved mig og mine Ord i denne utro og
      syndige Slægt, ved ham skal også Menneskesønnen skamme sig, når
      han kommer i sin Faders Herlighed med de hellige Engle."
      (Kap. 9.) 1 Og han sagde til dem: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, der
      er nogle af dem, som stå her, der ingenlunde skulle smage Døden,
      førend de se Guds Rige være kommet med Kraft."

Markus 9
  2.  Og seks Dage derefter tager Jesus Peter og Jakob og Johannes med
      sig og fører dem alene afsides op på et højt Bjerg, og han blev
      forvandlet for deres Øjne.
  3.  Og hans Klæder bleve skinnende, meget hvide, så at ingen
      Blegemand på Jorden kan gøre Klæder så hvide.
  4.  Og Elias tillige med Moses viste sig for dem, og de samtalede
      med Jesus.
  5.  Og Peter tog til Orde og siger til Jesus: "Rabbi! det er godt,
      at vi ere her, og lader os gøre tre Hytter, dig en og Moses en
      og Elias en."
  6.  Thi han vidste ikke, hvad han skulde sige; thi de vare blevne
      helt forfærdede.
  7.  Og der kom en Sky, som overskyggede dem; og en Røst kom fra
      Skyen: "Denne er min Søn, den elskede, hører ham!"
  8.  Og pludseligt, da de så sig om, så de ingen mere uden Jesus
      alene hos dem.
  9.  Og da de gik ned fra Bjerget, bød han dem, at de ikke måtte
      fortælle nogen, hvad de havde set, førend Menneskesønnen var
      opstanden fra de døde.
 10.  Og de fastholdt dette Ord hos sig selv og spurgte hverandre,
      hvad det er at opstå fra de døde.

 11.  Og de spurgte ham og sagde: "De skriftkloge sige jo, at Elias
      bør først komme?"
 12.  Men han sagde til dem: "Elias kommer først og genopretter
      alting; og hvorledes er der skrevet om Menneskesønnen? At han
      skal lide meget og foragtes.
 13.  Men jeg siger eder, at både er Elias kommen, og de gjorde ved
      ham alt, hvad de vilde, efter som der er skrevet om ham."

 14.  Og da de kom til Disciplene, så de en stor Skare omkring dem og
      skriftkloge, som tvistedes med dem.
 15.  Og straks studsede hele Skaren, da de så ham, og de løb hen og
      hilsede ham.
 16.  Og han spurgte dem: "Hvorom tvistes I med dem?"
 17.  Og en af Skaren svarede ham: "Mester! jeg har bragt min Søn til
      dig; han har en målløs Ånd.
 18.  Og hvor som helst den griber ham, slider den i ham, og han
      fråder og skærer Tænder, og han visner hen; og jeg har sagt til
      dine Disciple, at de skulde uddrive den, og de kunde ikke."
 19.  Men han svarede dem og sagde: "O du vantro Slægt! hvor længe
      skal jeg være hos eder, hvor længe skal jeg tåle eder? Bringer
      ham til mig!"
 20.  Og de ledte ham frem til ham; og da han så ham, sled Ånden
      straks i ham, og han faldt om på Jorden og væltede sig og
      fraadede.
 21.  Og han spurgte hans Fader: "Hvor længe er det siden, at dette er
      kommet over ham?" Men han sagde: "Fra Barndommen af;
 22.  og den har ofte kastet ham både i Ild og i Vand for at ødelægge
      ham; men om du formår noget, da forbarm dig over os, og hjælp
      os!"
 23.  Men Jesus sagde til ham: "Om du formår! Alle Ting ere mulige for
      den, som tror."
 24.  Straks råbte Barnets Fader og sagde med Tårer: "Jeg tror, hjælp
      min Vantro!"
 25.  Men da Jesus så, at Skaren stimlede sammen, truede han den urene
      Ånd og sagde til den: "Du målløse og døve Ånd! jeg byder dig,
      far ud af ham, og far ikke mere ind i ham!"
 26.  Da skreg og sled den meget i ham og for ud, og han blev ligesom
      død, så at de fleste sagde: "Han er død."
 27.  Men Jesus tog ham ved Hånden og rejste ham op; og han stod op.
 28.  Og da han var kommen ind i et Hus, spurgte hans Disciple ham i
      Enrum: "Hvorfor kunde vi ikke uddrive den?"
 29.  Og han sagde til dem: "Denne Slags kan ikke fare ud ved noget,
      uden ved Bøn og Faste."

 30.  Og da de gik ud derfra, vandrede de igennem Galilæa; og han
      vilde ikke, at nogen skulde vide det.
 31.  Thi han lærte sine Disciple og sagde til dem: "Menneskesønnen
      overgives i Menneskers Hænder, og de skulle slå ham ihjel; og
      når han er ihjelslået, skal han opstå tre Dage efter."
 32.  Men de forstode ikke det Ord og frygtede for at spørge ham.

 33.  Og de kom til Kapernaum, og da han var kommen ind i Huset,
      spurgte han dem: "Hvad var det, I overvejede med hverandre på
      Vejen?"
 34.  Men de tav; thi de havde talt med hverandre på Vejen om, hvem
      der var den største.
 35.  Og han satte sig og kaldte på de tolv og siger til dem: "Dersom
      nogen vil være den første, han skal være den sidste af alle og
      alles Tjener."
 36.  Og han tog et lille Barn og stillede det midt iblandt dem og tog
      det i Favn og sagde til dem:
 37.  "Den, som modtager eet af disse små Børn for mit Navns Skyld,
      modtager mig; og den, som modtager mig, modtager ikke mig, men
      den, som udsendte mig."

 38.  Johannes sagde til ham: "Mester! vi så en, som ikke følger os,
      uddrive onde Ånder i dit Navn; og vi forbød ham det, fordi han
      ikke følger os."
 39.  Men Jesus sagde: "Forbyder ham det ikke; thi der er ingen, som
      gør en kraftig Gerning i mit Navn og snart efter kan tale ilde
      om mig.
 40.  Thi den, som ikke er imod os, er for os.
 41.  Thi den, som giver eder et Bæger Vand at drikke i mit Navn,
      fordi I høre Kristus til, sandelig, siger jeg eder, han skal
      ingenlunde miste sin Løn

 42.  Og den, som forarger en af disse små, som tro, for ham var det
      bedre, at der lå en Møllesten om hans Hals, og han var kastet i
      Havet.
 43.  Og dersom din Hånd forarger dig, så hug den af; det er bedre for
      dig at gå som en Krøbling ind til Livet end at have to Hænder og
      fare til Helvede til den uudslukkelige Ild,
 44.  hvor deres Orm ikke dør, og Ilden ikke udslukkes.
 45.  Og dersom din Fod forarger dig, så hug den af; det er bedre for
      dig at gå lam ind til Livet end at have to Fødder og blive
      kastet i Helvede,
 46.  hvor deres Orm ikke dør, og Ilden ikke udslukkes.
 47.  Og dersom dit Øje forarger dig, så riv det ud; det er bedre for
      dig at gå enøjet ind i Guds Rige end at have to Øjne og blive
      kastet i Helvede,
 48.  hvor deres Orm ikke dør, og Ilden ikke udslukkes.
 49.  Thi enhver skal saltes med Ild, og alt Offer skal saltes med
      Salt.)
 50.  Saltet er godt; men dersom Saltet bliver saltløst, hvormed ville
      I da give det sin Kraft igen? Haver Salt i eder selv, og holder
      Fred med hverandre!"

Markus 10

  1.  Og han bryder op derfra og kommer til Judæas Egne og Landet
      hinsides Jordan, og atter samler der sig Skarer om ham; og han
      lærte dem atter, som han plejede.
  2.  Og Farisæerne kom hen og spurgte ham for at friste ham: "Er det
      en Mand tilladt at skille sig fra sin Hustru?"
  3.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Hvad har Moses budt eder?"
  4.  Men de sagde: "Moses tilstedte at skrive et Skilsmissebrev og
      skille sig fra hende."
  5.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "For eders Hjerters Hårdheds Skyld skrev
      han eder dette Bud.
  6.  Men fra Skabningens Begyndelse skabte Gud dem som Mand og
      Kvinde.
  7.  Derfor skal en Mand forlade sin Fader og Moder, og holde fast
      ved sin Hustru;
  8.  og de to skulle blive til eet Kød. Således ere de ikke længer
      to, men eet Kød.
  9.  Derfor, hvad Gud har sammenføjet, må et Menneske ikke adskille.
 10.  Og i Huset spurgte Disciplene ham atter om dette.
 11.  Og han siger til dem: "Den, som skiller sig fra sin Hustru og
      tager en anden til Ægte, han bedriver Hor imod hende.
 12.  Og dersom hun efter at have skilt sig fra sin Mand ægter en
      anden, bedriver hun Hor."

 13.  Og de bare små Børn til ham, for at han skulde røre ved dem; men
      Disciplene truede dem, som bare dem frem.
 14.  Men da Jesus så det, blev han vred og sagde til dem: "Lader de
      små Børn komme til mig; formener dem det ikke, thi Guds Rige
      hører sådanne til.
 15.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, den, som ikke modtager Guds Rige
      ligesom et lille Barn, han skal ingenlunde komme ind i det."
 16.  Og han tog dem i Favn og lagde Hænderne på dem og velsignede
      dem.

 17.  Og da han gik ud på Vejen, løb en hen og faldt på Knæ for ham og
      spurgte ham: "Gode Mester! hvad skal jeg gøre, for at jeg kan
      arve et evigt Liv?"
 18.  Men Jesus sagde til ham: "Hvorfor kalder du mig god? Ingen er
      god, uden een, nemlig Gud.
 19.  Du kender Budene: Du må ikke bedrive Hor; du må ikke slå ihjel;
      du må ikke stjæle; du må ikke sige falsk Vidnesbyrd; du må ikke
      besvige; ær din Fader og din Moder."
 20.  Men han sagde til ham: "Mester! det har jeg holdt alt sammen fra
      min Ungdom af."
 21.  Men Jesus så på ham og fattede Kærlighed til ham og sagde til
      ham: "Een Ting fattes dig; gå bort, sælg alt, hvad du har, og
      giv det til de fattige, så skal du have en Skat i Himmelen; og
      kom så og følg mig!"
 22.  Men han blev ilde til Mode over den Tale og gik bedrøvet bort;
      thi han havde meget Gods.
 23.  Og Jesus så sig omkring og siger til sine Disciple: "Hvor
      vanskeligt komme de, som have Rigdom, ind i Guds Rige!"
 24.  Men Disciplene bleve forfærdede over hans Ord. Men Jesus tog
      atter, til Orde og siger til dem: "Børn, hvor vanskeligt er det,
      at de som forlade sig på Rigdom, kunne komme ind i Guds Rige!
 25.  Det er lettere for en Kamel at gå igennem et Nåleøje end for en
      rig at gå ind i Guds Rige."
 26.  Men de forfærdedes overmåde og sagde til hverandre: "Hvem kan da
      blive frelst?"
 27.  Jesus så på dem og siger: "For Mennesker er det umuligt, men
      ikke for Gud; thi alle Ting ere mulige for Gud."

 28.  Peter tog til Orde og sagde til ham: "Se, vi have forladt alle
      Ting og fulgt dig."
 29.  Jesus sagde: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, der er ingen, som har
      forladt Hus eller Brødre eller Søstre eller Moder eller Fader
      eller Børn eller Marker for min og for Evangeliets Skyld,
 30.  uden at han jo skal få hundrede Fold igen, nu i denne Tid Huse
      og Brødre og Søstre og Mødre og Børn og Marker tillige med
      Forfølgelser, og i den kommende Verden et evigt Liv.
 31.  Men mange af de første skulle blive de sidste, og af de sidste
      de første."

 32.  Men de vare på Vejen op til Jerusalem; og Jesus gik foran dem,
      og de vare forfærdede, og de, som fulgte med, vare bange. Og han
      tog atter de tolv til sig og begyndte at sige dem, hvad der
      skulde times ham
 33.  "Se, vi drage op til Jerusalem, og Menneskesønnen skal overgives
      til Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge, og de skulle dømme ham
      til Døden og overgive ham til Hedningerne;
 34.  og de skulle spotte ham og spytte på ham og hudstryge ham og
      ihjelslå ham, og tre Dage efter skal han opstå."

 35.  Og Jakob og Johannes, Zebedæus's Sønner, gå hen til ham og sige:
      "Mester! vi ønske, at du vil gøre for os det, vi ville bede dig
      om."
 36.  Og han sag,de til dem: "Hvad ønske I, at jeg skal gøre for
      eder?"
 37.  Men de sagde til ham: "Giv os, at vi må sidde, den ene ved din
      højre Side og den anden ved din venstre Side i din Herlighed."
 38.  Men Jesus sagde til dem: "I vide ikke, hvad I bede om. Kunne I
      drikke den Kalk, som jeg drikker, eller døbes med den Dåb, som
      jeg døbes med?"
 39.  Men de sagde til ham: "Det kunne vi." Men Jesus sagde til dem:
      "Den Kalk, som jeg drikker, skulle I drikke, og den Dåb, som jeg
      døbes med, skulle I døbes med;
 40.  men det at sidde ved min højre eller ved min venstre Side
      tilkommer det ikke mig at give; men det gives til dem, hvem det
      er beredt."
 41.  Og da de ti hørte det, begyndte de at blive, vrede på Jakob og
      Johannes.
 42.  Og Jesus kaldte dem til sig og siger til dem: "I vide, at de,
      der gælde for Folkenes Fyrster; herske over dem, og de store
      iblandt dem bruge Myndighed over dem.
 43.  Men således er det ikke iblandt eder; men den, som vil blive
      stor iblandt eder, skal være eders Tjener;
 44.  og den, som vil blive den første af eder, skal være alles
      Tjener;
 45.  thi også Menneskesønnen er ikke kommen for at lade sig tjene,
      men for at tjene og give sit Liv til en Genløsning for mange."

 46.  Og de komme til Jeriko; og da han gik ud af Jeriko tillige med
      sine, Disciple og en stor Skare, sad Timæus's Søn, Bartimæus, en
      blind Tigger, ved Vejen.
 47.  Og da han hørte, at det var Jesus af Nazareth, begyndte han at
      råbe og sige: "Du Davids Søn, Jesus, forbarm dig over mig!"
 48.  Og mange truede ham,for at han skulde tie; men han råbte meget
      stærkere: "Du Davids Søn, forbarm dig over mig!"
 49.  Og Jesus stod stille og sagde: "Kalder på ham!" Og de kalde på
      den blinde og sige til ham: "Vær frimodig, stå op! han kalder på
      dig."
 50.  Men han kastede sin Overkjortel af sig, sprang op og kom til
      Jesus.
 51.  Og Jesus tog til Orde og sagde til ham: "Hvad vil du, at jeg
      skal gøre for dig?" Men den blinde sagde til ham: "Rabbuni, at
      jeg kan blive seende!"
 52.  Og Jesus sagde til ham: "Gå bort, din Tro har frelst dig." Og
      straks blev han seende, og han fulgte ham på Vejen.

Markus 11

  1.  Og da de nærme sig Jerusalem til Bethfage og Betania ved
      Oliebjerget, udsender han to af sine Disciple og siger til dem:
  2.  "Går hen til den Landsby, som ligger lige for eder, og straks,
      når I komme ind i den, skulle I finde et Føl bundet, på hvilket
      der endnu aldrig har siddet noget Menneske; løser det og fører
      det hid!
  3.  Og dersom nogen siger til eder: Hvorfor gøre I dette? da siger:
      Herren har Brug for det, og han sender det straks herhen igen."
  4.  Og de gik hen og fandt Føllet bundet ved Døren udenfor ved
      Gyden, og de løse det.
  5.  Og nogle af dem, som stode der, sagde til dem: "Hvad gøre I, at
      I løse Føllet?"
  6.  Men de sagde til dem, ligesom Jesus havde sagt, og de tilstedte
      dem det.
  7.  Og de føre Føllet til Jesus og lægge deres Klæder på det, og han
      satte sig på det.
  8.  Og mange bredte deres Klæder på Vejen, andre Kviste, som de
      afskare på Markerne.
  9.  Og de, som gik foran, og de, som fulgte efter, råbte: "Hosanna!
      velsignet være den, som kommer, i Herrens Navn!
 10.  Velsignet være vor Fader Davids Rige, som kommer, Hosanna i det
      højeste!"
 11.  Og han gik ind i Jerusalem, i Helligdommen, og da han havde
      beset alt, gik han, da det allerede var Aftenstid, ud til
      Bethania med de tolv.

 12.  Og den følgende Dag; da de gik ud fra Bethania, blev han
      hungrig.
 13.  Og da han så et Figentræ langt borte, som havde Blade, gik han
      derhen, om han måske kunde finde noget derpå, og da han kom til
      det, fandt han intet uden Blade; thi det var ikke Figentid.
 14.  Og han tog til Orde og sagde til det: "Aldrig i Evighed skal
      nogen mere spise Frugt af dig!" Og hans Disciple hørte det.

 15.  Og de komme til Jerusalem; og han gik ind i Helligdommen og
      begyndte at uddrive dem, som solgte og købte i Helligdommen, og
      han væltede Vekselerernes Borde og Duekræmmernes Stole.
 16.  Og han tilstedte ikke, at nogen bar nogen Ting igennem
      Helligdommen.  17. Og han lærte og sagde til dem: "Er der ikke
      skrevet, at mit Hus skal kaldes et Bedehus for alle
      Folkeslagene? Men I have gjort det til en Røverkule."
 18.  Og Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge hørte det, og de søgte,
      hvorledes de kunde slå ham ihjel; thi de frygtede for ham,
      eftersom hele Skaren blev slagen af, Forundring over hans Lære.

 19.  Og da det blev Aften, gik han uden for Staden.
 20.  Og da de om Morgenen gik forbi, så de, at Figentræet var visnet
      fra Roden af.
 21.  Og Peter kom det i Hu og siger til ham; "Rabbi! se, Figentræet,
      som du forbandede, er visnet."
 22.  Og Jesus svarede og siger til dem: "Haver Tro til Gud!
 23.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, den, som siger til dette Bjerg: Løft
      dig op og; kast dig i Havet, og ikke tvivler i sit Hjerte, men
      tror, at det sker, som han siger, ham skal det ske.
 24.  Derfor siger jeg eder: Alt, hvad I bede om og begære, tror, at I
      have fået det, så skal det ske eder.
 25.  Og når I stå og bede, da forlader, dersom I have noget imod
      nogen, for at også eders Fader, som er i Himlene, må forlade
      eder eders Overtrædelser.
 26.  Men dersom I ikke forlade, skal eders Fader, som er i Himlene,
      ej heller forlade eders Overtrædelser"

 27.  Og de komme atter til Jerusalem; og medens han gik omkring i
      Helligdommen, komme Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge og de
      Ældste hen til ham.
 28.  Og de sagde til ham: "Af hvad Magt gør du disse Ting? eller hvem
      har givet dig denne Magt til at gøre disse Ting?"
 29.  Men Jesus sagde til dem: "Jeg vil spørge eder om een Ting, og
      svarer mig derpå, så vil jeg sige eder, af hvad Magt jeg gør
      disse Ting.
 30.  Johannes's Dåb, var den fra Himmelen eller fra Mennesker? Svarer
      mig!"
 31.  Og de tænkte ved sig selv og sagde: "Sige vi: Fra Himmelen, da
      vil han sige, hvorfor troede I ham da ikke?
 32.  Men sige vi: Fra Mennesker" så frygtede de for Folket; thi alle
      holdt for, at Johannes virkelig var en Profet.
 33.  Og de svare og sige til Jesus: "Vi vide det ikke." Og Jesus
      siger til dem: "Så siger jeg eder ikke heller, af hvad Magt jeg
      gør disse Ting."

Markus 12

  1.  Og han begyndte at tale til dem i Lignelser: "En Mand plantede
      en Vingård og satte et Gærde derom og gravede en Perse og
      byggede et Tårn, og han lejede den ud til Vingårdsmænd og drog
      udenlands.
  2.  Og da Tiden kom, sendte han en Tjener til Vingårdsmændene, for
      at han af Vingårdsmændene kunde få af Vingårdens Frugter.
  3.  Og de grebe ham og sloge ham og sendte ham tomhændet bort.
  4.  Og han sendte atter en anden Tjener til dem; og ham sloge de i
      Hovedet og vanærede.
  5.  Og han sendte en anden; og ham sloge de ihjel; og mange andre;
      nogle sloge de, og andre dræbte de.
  6.  Endnu een havde han, en elsket Søn; ham sendte han til sidst til
      dem, idet han sagde: "De ville undse sig for min Søn."
  7.  Men hine Vingårdsmænd sagde til hverandre: "Der er Arvingen;
      kommer lader os slå ham ihjel, så bliver Arven vor."
  8.  Og de grebe ham og sloge ham ihjel og kastede ham ud af
      Vingården.
  9.  Hvad vil da Vingårdens Herre gøre? Han vil komme og ødelægge
      Vingårdsmændene og give Vingården til andre.
 10.  Have I ikke også læst dette Skriftord: Den Sten, som
      Bygningsmændene forkastede, den er bleven til en
      Hovedhjørnesten?
 11.  Fra Herren er dette kommet, og det er underligt for vore Øjne."
 12.  Og de søgte at gribe ham, men de frygtede for Mængden; thi de
      forstode, at han sagde denne Lignelse imod dem; og de forlode
      ham og gik bort.

 13.  Og de sendte nogle til ham af Farisæerne og af Herodianerne, for
      at de skulde fange ham i Ord.
 14.  Og de kom og sagde til ham: "Mester! vi vide, at du er sanddru
      og ikke bryder dig om nogen; thi du ser ikke på Menneskers
      Person, men lærer Guds Vej i Sandhed. Er det tilladt at give
      Kejseren Skat eller ej? Skulle vi give eller ikke give?"
 15.  Men da han så deres Hykleri, sagde han til dem: "Hvorfor friste
      I mig? Bringer mig en Denar", for at jeg kan se den."
 16.  Men de bragte den. Og han siger til dem: "Hvis Billede og
      Overskrift er dette?" Men de sagde til ham: "Kejserens."
 17.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "Giver Kejseren, hvad Kejserens er, og
      Gud, hvad Guds er." Og de undrede sig over ham.

 18.  Og der kommer Saddukæere til ham, hvilke jo sige, at der ingen
      Opstandelse er, og de spurgte ham og sagde:
 19.  "Mester! Moses har foreskrevet os, at når nogens Broder dør og
      og efterlader, en Hustru og ikke efterlader noget Barn, da skal
      hans Broder tage hans Hustru og oprejse sin Broder Afkom.
 20.  Der var syv Brødre; og den første tog en Hustru, og da han døde,
      efterlod han ikke Afkom.
 21.  Og den anden tog hende og døde uden at efterlade Afkom, og den
      tredje ligeså.
 22.  Og alle syv, de efterlode ikke Afkom. Sidst af dem alle døde og
      så Hustruen.
 23.  I Opstandelsen, når de opstå, hvem af dem skal så have hende til
      Hustru? Thi de have alle syv haft hende til Hustru."
 24.  Jesus sagde til dem: "Er det ikke derfor, I fare vild, fordi I
      ikke kende Skrifterne, ej heller Guds Kraft?
 25.  Thi når de opstå fra de døde, da tage de hverken til Ægte eller
      bortgiftes, men de ere som Engle i Himlene.
 26.  Men hvad de døde angår, at de oprejses, have I da ikke læst i
      Mose Bog i Stedet om Tornebusken, hvorledes Gud talede til ham
      og sagde: Jeg er Abrahams Gud og Isaks Gud og Jakobs Gud?
 27.  Han er ikke dødes, men levendes Gud; I fare meget vild."

 28.  Og en af de skriftkloge, som havde hørt deres Ordskifte og set,
      at han svarede dem godt, kom til ham og spurgte ham: "Hvilket
      Bud er det første af alle?"
 29.  Jesus svarede: "Det første er: Hør Israel! Herren, vor Gud,
      Herren er een;
 30.  og du skal elske Herren, din Gud af hele dit Hjerte og af hele
      din Sjæl og af hele dit Sind og af hele din Styrke.
 31.  Et andet er dette: Du skal elske din Næste som dig selv. Større
      end disse er intet andet Bud."
 32.  Og den skriftkloge sagde til ham: "Rigtigt, Mester, og med
      Sandhed har du sagt, at han er een, og der er ingen anden
      foruden ham.
 33.  Og at elske ham af hele sit Hjerte og af hele sin Forstand og af
      hele sin Styrke og at elske sin Næste som sig selv, det er mere
      end alle Brændofrene og Slagtofrene."
 34.  Og da Jesus så, at han svarede forstandigt, sagde han til ham:
      "Du er ikke langt fra Guds Rige." Og ingen vovede mere at rette
      Spørgsmål til ham.

 35.  Og da Jesus lærte i Helligdommen, tog han til Orde og sagde:
      "Hvorledes sige de skriftkloge, at Kristus er Davids Søn?
 36.  David selv sagde ved den Helligånd: Herren sagde til min Herre:
      Sæt dig ved min, højre Hånd, indtil jeg får lagt dine Fjender
      som en Skammel for dine Fødder.
 37.  David selv kalder ham Herre; hvorledes er han da hans Søn?" Og
      den store Skare hørte ham gerne.

 38.  Og han sagde i sin Undervisning: "Tager eder i Vare for de
      skriftkloge, som gerne ville gå i lange Klæder og lade sig hilse
      på Torvene
 39.  og gerne ville have de fornemste Pladser i Synagogerne og sidde
      øverst til Bords ved Måltiderne;
 40.  de, som opæde Enkers Huse og på Skrømt bede længe, disse skulle
      få des hårdere Dom."

 41.  Og han satte sig lige over for Tempelblokken og så, hvorledes
      Mængden lagde Penge i Blokken, og mange rige lagde meget deri.
 42.  Og der kom en fattig Enke og lagde to Skærve i, hvilket er en
      Hvid".
 43.  Og han kaldte sine Disciple til sig og sagde til dem: "Sandelig,
      siger jeg eder, denne fattige Enke har lagt mere deri end alle
      de som lagde i Tempelblokken.
 44.  Thi de lagde alle af deres Overflod; men hun lagde af sin
      Fattigdom alt det, hun havde, sin hele Ejendom."

Markus 13

  1.  og da han gik ud af Helligdommen, siger en af hans Disciple til
      ham: "Mester, se, hvilke Sten og hvilke Bygninger!"
  2.  Og Jesus sagde til ham: "Ser du disse store Bygninger? der skal
      ikke lades Sten på Sten, som jo skal nedbrydes."
  3.  Og da han sad på Oliebjerget, lige over for Helligdommen,
      spurgte Peter og Jakob og Johannes og Andreas ham afsides:
  4.  "Sig os, når skal dette ske, og hvilket er Tegnet, når alt dette
      skal til at fuldbyrdes?"
  5.  Men Jesus begyndte at sige til dem: "Ser til, at ingen forfører
      eder!"
  6.  Mange skulle på mit Navn komme og sige: Det er mig; og de skulle
      forføre mange.
  7.  Men når I høre om Krige og Krigsrygter, da lader eder ikke
      forskrække, thi det må ske; men Enden er ikke endda.
  8.  Thi Folk skal rejse sig mod Folk, og Rige mod Rige, og der skal
      være Jordskælv her og der, og der skal være Hungersnød og
      Oprør. Dette er Veernes Begyndelse.
  9.  Men I, tager Vare på eder selv; de skulle overgive eder til
      Rådsforsamlinger og til Synagoger; I skulle piskes og stilles
      for Landshøvdinger og Konger for min Skyld, dem til et
      Vidnesbyrd.
 10.  Og Evangeliet bør først prædikes for alle Folkeslagene.
 11.  Og når de føre eder hen og overgive eder, da bekymrer eder ikke
      forud for, hvad I skulle tale; men hvad der bliver givet eder i
      den samme Time, det skulle I tale; thi I ere ikke de, som tale,
      men den Helligånd.
 12.  Og Broder skal overgive Broder til Døden, og Fader sit Barn og
      Børn skulle stå op mod Forældre og slå dem ihjel.
 13.  Og I skulle hades af alle for mit Navns Skyld; men den, som
      holder ud indtil Enden, han skal blive frelst.
 14.  Men når I se Ødelæggelsens Vederstyggelighed stå, hvor den ikke
      bør, (den, som læser det, han give Agt! ) da skulle de, som ere
      i Judæa, fly til Bjergene;
 15.  men den, som er på Taget, stige ikke ned eller gå ind for at
      hente noget fra sit Hus;
 16.  og den, som er på Marken, vende ikke tilbage for at hente sine
      Klæder!
 17.  Men ve de frugtsommelige og dem, som give Die, i de Dage!
 18.  Men beder om, at det ikke skal ske om Vinteren;
 19.  thi i de Dage skal der være en sådan Trængsel som der ikke har
      været fra Skabningens Begyndelse, da Gud skabte den, indtil nu,
      og som der heller ikke skal komme.
 20.  Og dersom Herren ikke afkortede de dage, da blev intet Kød
      frelst; men for de udvalgtes Skyld, som han har udvalgt, har han
      afkortet de Dage
 21.  Og dersom nogen da siger til eder: Se, her er Kristus, eller se
      der! da tror det ikke.
 22.  Thi falske Krister og falske Profeter skulle fremstå og gøre
      Tegn og Undergerninger for at forføre, om det var muligt, de
      udvalgte.
 23.  Men I, vogter eder; jeg har sagt eder alt forud.
 24.  Men i de dage, efter den Trængsel, skal Solen formørkes, og
      Månen ikke give sit Skin,
 25.  og Stjernerne skulle falde ned fra Himmelen, og de Kræfter, som
      ere i Himlene, skulle rystes.
 26.  Og da skulle de se Menneskesønnen komme i Skyerne med megen
      Kraft og Herlighed.
 27.  Og da skal han udsende sine Engle og samle sine udvalgte fra de
      fire Vinde, fra Jordens Ende indtil Himmelens Ende.
 28.  Men lærer Lignelsen af Figentræet: Når dets Gren allerede er
      bleven blød, og Bladene skyde frem, da skønne I, at Sommeren er
      nær.
 29.  Således skulle også I, når I se disse Ting, skønne, af han er
      nær for Døren.
 30.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, denne Slægt skal ingenlunde forgå,
      førend alle disse ting ere skete
 31.  Himmelen og Jorden skulle forgå, men mine Ord skulle ingenlunde
      forgå:
 32.  Men om den Dag og Time ved ingen, end ikke Englene i Himmelen,
      heller ikke Sønnen, men alene Faderen.

 33.  Ser til, våger og beder; thi I vide ikke, når Tiden er der.
 34.  Ligesom en Mand, der drog udenlands, forlod sit Hus og gav sine
      Tjenere Fuldmagt, hver sin Gerning, og bød Dørvogteren, at han
      skulde våge,
 35.  våger derfor; thi I vide ikke, når Husets Herre kommer, enten om
      Aftenen eller ved Midnat eller ved Hanegal eller om Morgenen;
 36.  for at han ikke, når han kommer pludseligt, skal finde eder
      sovende!
 37.  Men hvad jeg siger eder, det siger jeg alle: Våger!"

Markus 14

  1.  Men to Dage derefter var det Påske og de usyrede Brøds
      Højtid. Og Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge søgte, hvorledes
      de med List kunde gribe og ihjelslå ham.
  2.  Thi de sagde: "Ikke på Højtiden, for at der ikke skal blive
      Oprør iblandt Folket."

  3.  Og da han var i Bethania, i Simon den spedalskes Hus, kom der,
      medens han sad til Bords, en Kvinde, som havde en Alabastkrukke
      med ægte, såre kostbar Nardussalve; og hun sønderbrød
      Alabastkrukken og udgød den på hans Hoved.
  4.  Men der var nogle, som bleve vrede hos sig selv og sagde:
      "Hvortil er denne Spilde af Salven sket?
  5.  Denne Salve kunde jo være solgt for mere end tre Hundrede
      Denarer og være given til de fattige." Og de overfusede hende.
  6.  Men Jesus sagde: "Lader hende være, hvorfor volde I hende
      Fortrædeligheder? Hun har gjort en god Gerning imod mig.
  7.  De fattige have I jo altid hos eder, og når I ville, kunne I
      gøre vel imod dem; men mig have I ikke altid.
  8.  Hun gjorde, hvad hun kunde; hun salvede forud mit Legeme til
      Begravelsen.
  9.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, hvor som helst i hele Verden
      Evangeliet bliver prædiket, skal også det, som hun har gjort,
      omtales til hendes Ihukommelse."

 10.  Og Judas Iskariot, en af de tolv, gik hen til Ypperstepræsterne
      for at forråde ham til dem.
 11.  Men da de hørte det, bleve de glade, og de lovede at give ham
      Penge; og han søgte, hvorledes han kunde få Lejlighed til at
      forråde ham.

 12.  Og på de usyrede Brøds første Dag, da man slagtede Påskelammet,
      sige hans Disciple til ham: "Hvor vil du, at vi skulle gå hen og
      træffe Forberedelse til, at du kan spise Påskelammet?"
 13.  Og han sender to af sine Disciple og siger til dem: "Går ind i
      Staden, så skal der møde eder en Mand, som bærer en Vandkrukke;
      følger ham;
 14.  og hvor han går ind, der skulle I sige til Husbonden: Mesteren
      siger: Hvor er mit Herberge, hvor jeg kan spise Påskelammet med
      mine Disciple?
 15.  Og han skal vise eder en stor Sal, opdækket og rede; og der
      skulle I berede det for os."
 16.  Og hans Disciple gik bort og kom ind i Staden og fandt det,
      således som han havde sagt dem; og de beredte Påskelammet.
 17.  Og da det var blevet Aften, kommer han med de tolv.
 18.  Og medens de sade til Bords og spiste, sagde Jesus: "Sandelig,
      siger jeg eder, en af eder, som spiser med mig, vil forråde
      mig."
 19.  De begyndte at bedrøves og at sige til ham, en efter en: "Det er
      dog vel ikke mig?"
 20.  Men han sagde til dem: "En af de tolv, den, som dypper med mig i
      Fadet
 21.  Thi Menneskesønnen går vel bort, som der er skrevet om ham; men
      ve det, Menneske ved hvem Menneskesønnen bliver forrådt! Det var
      godt for det Menneske, om han ikke var født."

 22.  Og medens de spiste, tog han Brød, velsignede og brød det og gav
      dem det og sagde: "Tager det; dette er mit Legeme."
 23.  Og han tog en Kalk, takkede og gav dem den; og de drak alle
      deraf.
 24.  Og han sagde til dem: "Dette er mit Blod, Pagtens, hvilket
      udgydes for mange.
 25.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, at jeg skal ingen Sinde mere drikke af
      Vintræets Frugt indtil den Dag, da jeg skal drikke den ny i Guds
      Rige."

 26.  Og da de havde sunget Lovsangen, gik de ud til Oliebjerget
 27.  Og Jesus siger til dem: "I skulle alle forarges; thi der er
      skrevet: Jeg vil slå Hyrden, og Fårene skulle adspredes.
 28.  Men efter at jeg er bleven oprejst, vil jeg gå forud for eder
      til Galilæa."
 29.  Men Peter sagde til ham: "Dersom de endog alle forarges, vil jeg
      dog ikke forarges."
 30.  Og Jesus siger til ham: "Sandelig siger jeg dig, i Dag, i denne
      Nat, førend Hanen galer to Gange, skal du fornægte mig tre
      Gange."
 31.  Men han sagde end yderligere: "Om jeg end skulde dø med dig, vil
      jeg ingenlunde fornægte dig." Men ligeså sagde de også alle.

 32.  Og de komme til en Gård, hvis Navn var Gethsemane; og han siger
      til sine Disciple "Sætter eder her, imedens jeg beder."
 33.  Og han tager Peter og Jakob og Johannes med sig, og han begyndte
      at forfærdes og svarlig at ængstes.
 34.  Og han siger til dem: "Min Sjæl er dybt bedrøvet indtil Døden;
      bliver her og våger!"
 35.  Og han gik lidt frem, kastede sig ned på Jorden og bad om, at
      den Time måtte gå ham forbi, om det var muligt.
 36.  Og han sagde: "Abba Fader! alting er dig muligt; tag denne Kalk
      fra mig; dog ikke hvad jeg vil, men hvad du vil."
 37.  Og han kommer og finder dem sovende og siger til Peter: "Simon,
      sover du? Kunde du ikke våge een Time?
 38.  Våger, og beder, for at I ikke skulle falde i Fristelse; Ånden
      er vel redebon, men Kødet er skrøbeligt."
 39.  Og han gik atter hen og bad og sagde det samme Ord,
 40.  Og han vendte tilbage og fandt dem atter sovende; thi deres Øjne
      vare betyngede, og de vidste ikke, hvad de skulde svare ham.
 41.  Og han kommer tredje Gang og siger til dem: "Sove I fremdeles og
      hvile eder? Det er nok; Timen er kommen; se, Menneskesønnen
      forrådes i Synderes Hænder.
 42.  Står op, lader os gå; se, han, som forråder mig, er nær."

 43.  Og straks, medens han endnu talte, kommer Judas, en af de tolv,
      og med ham en stor Skare med Sværd og Knipler fra
      Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge og de Ældste.
 44.  Men han, som forrådte ham, havde givet dem et aftalt Tegn og
      sagt: "Den, som jeg kysser, ham er det; griber ham, og fører ham
      sikkert bort!"
 45.  Og da han kom, trådte han straks hen til ham og siger: "Rabbi!
      Rabbi!" og han kyssede ham.
 46.  Men de lagde Hånd på ham og grebe ham.
 47.  Men en af dem, som stode hos, drog Sværdet, slog
      Ypperstepræstens Tjener og afhuggede hans Øre.
 48.  Og Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "I ere gåede ud som imod en
      Røver, med Sværd og med Knipler for at fange mig.
 49.  Daglig var jeg hos eder i Helligdommen og lærte, og I grebe mig
      ikke; men dette sker, for af Skrifterne skulle opfyldes."
 50.  Og de forlode ham alle og flyede.
 51.  Og en enkelt, et ungt Menneske, som havde et Linklæde over det
      blotte Legeme, fulgte med ham; og de gribe ham;
 52.  men han slap Linklædet og flygtede nøgen.

 53.  Og de førte Jesus hen til Ypperstepræsten; og alle
      Ypperstepræsterne og de Ældste og de skriftkloge komme sammen
      hos ham.
 54.  Og Peter fulgte ham i Frastand til ind i Ypperstepræstens Gård,
      og han sad hos Svendene og varmede sig ved Ilden.
 55.  Men Ypperstepræsterne og hele Rådet søgte Vidnesbyrd imod Jesus,
      for at de kunde aflive ham; og de fandt intet.
 56.  Thi mange sagde falsk Vidnesbyrd imod ham, men Vidnesbyrdene
      stemte ikke overens.
 57.  Og nogle stode op og vidnede falsk imod ham og sagde:
 58.  "Vi have hørt ham sige: Jeg vil nedbryde dette Tempel, som er
      gjort med Hænder, og i tre Dage bygge et andet, som ikke er
      gjort med Hænder."
 59.  Og end ikke således stemte deres Vidnesbyrd overens.
 60.  Og Ypperstepræsten stod op midt iblandt dem og spurgte Jesus og
      sagde: "Svarer du slet intet på, hvad disse vidne imod dig?"
 61.  Men han tav og svarede intet. Atter spurgte Ypperstepræsten ham
      og siger til ham: "Er du Kristus, den Højlovedes Søn?"
 62.  Men Jesus sagde: "Jeg er det; og I skulle se Menneskesønnen
      sidde ved Kraftens højre Hånd og komme med Himmelens Skyer."
 63.  Men Ypperstepræsten sønderrev sine Klæder og sagde: "Hvad have
      vi længere Vidner nødig?
 64.  I have hørt Gudsbespottelsen; hvad tykkes eder?" Men de fældede
      alle den Dom over ham, at han var skyldig til Døden.
 65.  Og nogle begyndte af spytte på ham og tilhylle hans Ansigt og
      give ham Næveslag og sige til ham: "Profeter!" og Svendene
      modtoge ham med Slag på Kinden.

 66.  Og medens Peter var nedenfor i Gården, kommer en af
      Ypperstepræstens Piger,
 67.  og da hun ser Peter varme sig, ser hun på ham og siger: "Også du
      var med Nazaræeren, med Jesus."
 68.  Men han nægtede og sagde: "Jeg hverken ved eller forstår, hvad
      du siger;" og han gik ud i Forgården, og Hanen galede.
 69.  Og Pigen så ham og begyndte atter at sige til dem, som stode
      hos: "Denne er en af dem."
 70.  Men han nægtede det atter. Og lidt derefter sagde atter de, som
      stode hos, til Peter: "Sandelig, du er en af dem; du er jo også
      en Galilæer."
 71.  Men han begyndte at forbande sig og sværge: "Jeg kender ikke
      dette Menneske, om hvem I tale."
 72.  Og straks galede Hanen anden Gang. Og Peter kom det Ord i Hu,
      som Jesus sagde til ham: "Førend Hanen galer to Gange, skal du
      fornægte mig tre Gange." Og han brast i Gråd.

Markus 15

  1.  Og straks om Morgenen, da Ypperstepræsterne havde holdt Råd med
      de Ældste og de skriftkloge, hele Rådet, bandt de Jesus og førte
      ham bort og overgave ham til Pilatus.
  2.  Og Pilatus spurgte ham: "Er du Jødernes Konge?" Og han svarede
      og sagde til ham: "Du siger det."
  3.  Og Ypperstepræsterne anklagede ham meget.
  4.  Men Pilatus spurgte ham atter og sagde: "Svarer du slet intet?
      Se, hvor meget de anklage dig for!"
  5.  Men Jesus svarede ikke mere noget, så at Pilatus undrede sig.
  6.  Men på Højtiden plejede han at løslade dem een Fange, hvilken de
      forlangte.
  7.  Men der var en, som hed Barabbas, der var fangen tillige med de
      Oprørere, som under Oprøret havde begået Mord
  8.  Og Mængden gik op og begyndte at bede om, at han vilde gøre for
      dem, som han plejede.
  9.  Men Pilatus svarede dem og sagde: "Ville I, at jeg skal løslade
      eder Jødernes Konge?"
 10.  Thi han skønnede, at det var af Avind, at Ypperstepræsterne
      havde overgivet ham.
 11.  Men Ypperstepræsterne ophidsede Mængden til at bede om, at han
      hellere skulde løslade dem Barabbas.
 12.  Men Pilatus svarede atter og sagde til dem: "Hvad ville I da,
      jeg skal gøre med ham, som I kalde Jødernes Konge?"
 13.  Men de råbte atter: "Korsfæst ham!"
 14.  Men Pilatus sagde til dem: "Hvad ondt har han da gjort?" Men de
      råbte højlydt: "Korsfæst ham!"
 15.  Og da Pilatus vilde gøre Mængden tilpas, løslod han dem
      Barabbas; og Jesus lod han hudstryge og gav ham hen til at
      korsfæstes.

 16.  Men Stridsmændene førte ham ind i Gården, det vil sige Borgen,
      og de sammenkalde hele Vagtafdelingen.
 17.  Og de iføre ham en Purpurkappe og flette en Tornekrone og sætte
      den på ham.
 18.  Og de begyndte at hilse ham: "Hil være dig, du Jødernes Konge!"
 19.  Og de sloge ham på Hovedet med et Rør og spyttede på ham og
      faldt på Knæ og tilbade ham.
 20.  Og da de havde spottet ham, toge de Purpurkappen af ham og
      iførte ham hans egne Klæder. Og de føre ham ud for at korsfæste
      ham.

 21.  Og de tvinge en, som gik forbi, Simon fra Kyrene, som kom fra
      Marken, Aleksanders og Rufus's Fader, til af bære hans Kors.
 22.  Og de føre ham til det Sted Golgatha, det er udlagt:
      "Hovedskalsted"
 23.  Og de gave ham Vin at drikke med Myrra i; men han tog det ikke.
 24.  Og de korsfæste ham, og de dele hans Klæder ved at kaste Lod om
      dem, hvad enhver skulde tage.
 25.  Men det var den tredje Time, da de korsfæstede ham.
 26.  Og Overskriften med Beskyldningen imod ham var påskreven
      således: "Jødernes Konge".
 27.  Og de korsfæste to Røvere sammen med ham, en ved hans højre og
      en ved hans venstre Side.
 28.  Og Skriften blev opfyldt, som siger: "Og han blev regnet iblandt
      Overtrædere."
 29.  Og de, som gik forbi, spottede ham, idet de rystede på deres
      Hoveder og sagde: "Tvi dig! du som nedbryder Templet og bygger
      det op i tre Dage;
 30.  frels dig selv ved at stige ned af Korset!"
 31.  Ligeså spottede også Ypperstepræsterne indbyrdes tillige med de
      skriftkloge og sagde: "Andre har han frelst, sig selv kan han
      ikke frelse.
 32.  Kristus, Israels Konge - lad ham nu stige ned af Korset, for at
      vi kunne se det og, tro!" Også de, som vare korsfæstede med ham,
      hånede ham.
 33.  Og da den sjette Time var kommen, blev der Mørke over hele
      Landet indtil den niende Time.
 34.  Og ved den niende Time råbte Jesus med høj Røst og sagde: "Eloi!
      Eloi! Lama Sabaktani?" det er udlagt: "Min Gud! min Gud! hvorfor
      har du forladt mig?"
 35.  Og nogle af dem, som stode hos, sagde, da de hørte det: "Se; han
      kalder på Elias."
 36.  Men en løb hen og fyldte en Svamp med Eddike og stak den på et
      Rør og gav ham at drikke og sagde: "Holdt! lader os se, om Elias
      kommer for at tage ham ned."
 37.  Men Jesus råbte med høj Røst og udåndede.

 38.  Og Forhænget i Templet splittedes i to fra øverst til nederst.
 39.  Men da Høvedsmanden, som stod hos, lige over for ham, så, af han
      udåndede på denne Vis, sagde han: "Sandelig, dette Menneske var
      Guds Søn."
 40.  Men der var også Kvinder, som så til i Frastand, iblandt hvilke
      også vare Maria Magdalene og Maria, Jakob den Lilles og Joses's
      Moder, og Salome,
 41.  hvilke også fulgte ham og tjente ham, da han var i Galilæa, og
      mange andre Kvinder, som vare gåede op til Jerusalem med ham.

 42.  Og da det allerede var blevet Aften, (thi det var Beredelsesdag,
      det er Forsabbat,)
 43.  kom Josef fra Arimathæa, en anset Rådsherre, som også selv
      forventede Guds Rige; han tog Mod til sig og gik ind til Pilatus
      og bad om Jesu Legeme.
 44.  Men Pilatus forundrede sig over, at han allerede skulde være
      død,
 45.  og han hidkaldte Høvedsmanden og spurgte ham, om han allerede
      nogen Tid havde været død; og da han fik det at vide af
      Høvedsmanden, skænkede han Josef Liget.
 46.  Og denne købte et fint Linklæde, tog ham ned, svøbte ham i
      Linklædet og lagde ham i en Grav, som var udhugget i en Klippe,
      og han, væltede en Sten for Indgangen til Graven.
 47.  Men Maria Magdalene og Maria, Joses's Moder, så, hvor ham blev
      lagt.

Markus 16

  1.  Og da Sabbaten var forbi købte Maria Magdalene og Maria, Jakobs
      Moder, og Salome vellugtende Salver for at komme og Salve ham.
  2.  Og meget årle på den første Dag i Ugen komme de til Graven, da
      Solen var stået op.
  3.  Og de sagde til hverandre: "Hvem skal vælte os Stenen fra
      Indgangen til Graven?"
  4.  Og da de så op, bleve de var, at Stenen var væltet fra; (thi den
      var meget stor)
  5.  Og da de kom ind i Graven, så de en Yngling sidde ved den højre
      Side, iført et hvidt Klædebon, og de forfærdedes.
  6.  Men han siger til dem: "Forfærdes ikke! I lede efter Jesus at
      Nazareth, den korsfæstede; han er opstanden, han er ikke her,
      se, der er Stedet, hvor de lagde ham.
  7.  Men går bort, siger til hans Disciple og til Peter at han går
      forud for eder til Galilæa; der skulle I se ham, som han har
      sagt eder."
  8.  Og de gik ud og flyede fra Graven; thi Skælven og Forfærdelse
      betog dem; og de sagde ikke noget til nogen; thi de frygtede.

  9.  Men da han var opstanden årle den første Dag i Ugen, åbenbaredes
      han først for Maria Magdalene, af hvem han havde uddrevet syv
      onde Ånder.
 10.  Hun gik hen og forkyndte det for dem, der havde været med ham,
      og som sørgede og græd.
 11.  Og da disse hørte, at han levede og var set af hende, troede de
      det ikke.
 12.  Men derefter åbenbaredes han for to af dem på Vejen i en anden
      Skikkelse, medens de gik ud på Landet.
 13.  Og disse gik hen og forkyndte de andre det. Ikke heller dem
      troede de.
 14.  Siden åbenbaredes han for de elleve selv, medens de sade til
      Bords, og han bebrejdede dem deres Vantro og Hjerters Hårdhed,
      fordi de ikke havde troet dem, som havde set ham opstanden.
 15.  Og han sagde til dem: "Går ud i al Verden og prædiker Evangeliet
      for al Skabningen!
 16.  Den, som tror og bliver døbt, skal blive frelst; men den, som
      ikke tror, skal blive fordømt.
 17.  Men disse Tegn skulle følge dem, som tro: I mit Navn skulle de
      uddrive onde Ånder; de skulle tale med nye Tunger;
 18.  de skulle tage på Slanger, og dersom de drikke nogen Gift, skal
      det ikke skade dem; på syge skulle de lægge Hænder, og de skulle
      helbredes."

 19.  Så blev Herren efter at han havde talt med dem, optagen til
      Himmelen og satte sig ved Guds højre Hånd.
 20.  Men de gik ud og prædikede alle Vegne, idet Herren arbejdede med
      og stadfæstede Ordet ved de medfølgende Tegn.


Lukas

Lukas 1

  1.  Efterdi mange have taget sig for at forfatte en Beretning om de
      Ting, som ere fuldbyrdede iblandt os,
  2.  således som de, der fra Begyndelsen bleve Øjenvidner og Ordets
      Tjenere, have overleveret os:
  3.  så har også jeg besluttet, efter nøje at have gennemgået alt
      forfra, at nedskrive det for dig i Orden, mægtigste Theofilus!
  4.  for at du kan erkende Pålideligheden af de Ting, hvorom du er
      bleven mundtligt undervist.

  5.  I de Dage, da Herodes var Konge i Judæa, var der en Præst af
      Abias Skifte, ved Navn Sakarias; og han havde en Hustru af Arons
      Døtre, og hendes Navn var Elisabeth.
  6.  Men de vare begge retfærdige for Gud og vandrede udadlelige i
      alle Herrens Bud og Forskrifter.
  7.  Og de havde intet Barn, efterdi Elisabeth var ufrugtbar, og de
      vare begge fremrykkede i Alder.
  8.  Men det skete, medens han efter sit Skiftes Orden gjorde
      Præstetjeneste for Gud,
  9.  tilfaldt det ham efter Præstetjenestens Sædvane at gå ind i
      Herrens Tempel og bringe Røgelseofferet.
 10.  Og hele Folkets Mængde holdt Bøn udenfor i Røgelseofferets Time.
 11.  Men en Herrens Engel viste sig for ham, stående ved den højre
      Side af Røgelsesalteret.
 12.  Og da Sakarias så ham, forfærdedes han, og Frygt faldt over ham.
 13.  Men Engelen sagde til ham: "Frygt ikke, Sakarias! thi din Bøn er
      hørt, og din Hustru Elisabeth skal føde dig en Søn, og du skal
      kalde hans Navn Johannes.
 14.  Og han skal blive dig til Glæde og Fryd, og mange skulle glædes
      over hans Fødsel;
 15.  thi han skal være stor for Herren. Og Vin og stærk Drik skal han
      ej drikke, og han skal fyldes med den Helligånd alt fra Moders
      Liv,
 16.  og mange af Israels Børn skal han omvende til Herren deres Gud.
 17.  Og han skal gå foran for ham i Elias's Ånd og Kraft for at vende
      Fædres Hjerter til Børn og genstridige til retfærdiges Sind for
      at berede Herren et velskikket folk."
 18.  Og Sakarias sagde til Engelen: "Hvorpå skal jeg kende dette? thi
      jeg er gammel, og min Hustru er fremrykket i Alder."
 19.  Og Engelen svarede og sagde til ham: "Jeg er Gabriel, som står
      for Guds Åsyn, og jeg er udsendt for at tale til dig og for at
      forkynde dig dette Glædesbudskab.
 20.  Og se, du skal blive stum og ikke kunne tale indtil den Dag, da
      dette sker, fordi du ikke troede mine Ord, som dog skulle
      fuldbyrdes i deres Tid,"
 21.  Og folket biede efter Sakarias, og de undrede sig over, at han
      tøvede i Templet.
 22.  Og da han kom ud, kunde han ikke tale til dem, og de forstode,
      at han havde set et Syn i Templet; og han gjorde Tegn til dem og
      forblev stum.
 23.  Og det skete, da hans Tjenestes Dage vare fuldendte, gik han
      hjem til sit Hus.
 24.  Men efter disse Dage blev hans Hustru Elisabeth frugtsommelig,
      og hun skjulte sig fem Måneder og sagde:
 25.  "Således har Herren gjort imod mig i de Dage, da han så til mig
      for at borttage min Skam iblandt Mennesker:"

 26.  Men i den sjette Måned blev Engelen Gabriel sendt fra Gud til en
      By i Galilæa, som hedder Nazareth,
 27.  til en Jomfru, som var trolovet med en Mand ved Navn Josef, af
      Davids Hus; og Jomfruens Navn var Maria.
 28.  Og Engelen kom ind til hende og sagde: "Hil være dig, du
      benådede, Herren er med dig, du velsignede iblandt Kvinder!"
 29.  Men hun blev forfærdet over den Tale, og hun tænkte, hvad dette
      skulde være for en Hilsen.
 30.  Og Engelen sagde til hende: "Frygt ikke, Maria! thi du har
      fundet Nåde hos Gud.
 31.  Og se, du skal undfange og føde en Søn,og du skal kalde hans
      Navn Jesus.
 32.  Han skal være stor og kaldes den Højestes Søn; og Gud Herren
      skal give ham Davids, hans Faders Trone.
 33.  Og han skal være Konge over Jakobs Hus evindelig, og der skal
      ikke være Ende på hans Kongedømme."
 34.  Men Maria sagde til Engelen: "Hvorledes skal dette gå til,
      efterdi jeg ikke ved af nogen Mand?"
 35.  Og Engelen svarede og sagde til hende: Den Helligånd skal komme
      over dig, og den Højestes Kraft skal overskygge dig; derfor skal
      også det hellige, som fødes,. kaldes Guds Søn.
 36.  Og se, Elisabeth din Frænke, også hun har undfanget en Søn i sin
      Alderdom, og denne Måned er den sjette for hende, som kaldes
      ufrugtbar.
 37.  Thi intet vil være umuligt for Gud."
 38.  Men Maria sagde: "Se, jeg er Herrens Tjenerinde; mig ske efter
      dit Ord!" Og Engelen skiltes fra hende.

 39.  Men Maria stod op i de samme Dage og drog skyndsomt til
      Bjergegnen til en By i Juda.
 40.  Og hun kom ind i Sakarias's Hus og hilste Elisabeth.
 41.  Og det skete, da Elisabeth hørte Marias Hilsen, sprang Fosteret
      i hendes Liv. Og Elisabeth blev fyldt med den Helligånd
 42.  og råbte med høj Røst og sagde: "Velsignet er du iblandt
      Kvinder!  og velsignet er dit Livs Frugt!
 43.  Og hvorledes times dette mig, at min Herres Moder kommer til
      mig?
 44.  Thi se, da din Hilsens Røst nåede mine Øren, sprang Fosteret i
      mit Liv med Fryd.
 45.  Og salig er hun, som troede; thi det skal fuldkommes, hvad der
      er sagt hende af Herren,"
 46.  Og Maria sagde: "Min Sjæl ophøjer Herren;
 47.  og min Ånd fryder sig over Gud, min Frelser;
 48.  thi han har set til sin Tjenerindes Ringhed. Thi se, nu herefter
      skulle alle Slægter prise mig salig,
 49.  fordi den mægtige har gjort store Ting imod mig. Og hans Navn er
      helligt;
 50.  og hans Barmhjertighed varer fra Slægt til Slægt over dem, som
      frygte ham.
 51.  Han har øvet Vælde med sin Arm; han har adspredt dem, som ere
      hovmodige i deres Hjertes Tanke.
 52.  Han har nedstødt mægtige fra Troner og ophøjet ringe.
 53.  Hungrige har han mættet med gode Gaver, og rige har han sendt
      tomhændede bort.
 54.  Han har taget sig af sin Tjener Israel for at ihukomme
      Barmhjertighed
 55.  imod Abraham og hans Sæd til evig Tid, således som han talte til
      vore Fædre."
 56.  Og Maria blev hos hende omtrent tre Måneder, og hun drog til sit
      Hjem igen.

 57.  Men for Elisabeth fuldkommedes Tiden til, at hun skulde føde, og
      hun fødte en Søn.
 58.  Og hendes Naboer og Slægtninge hørte, at Herren havde gjort sin
      Barmhjertighed stor imod hende, og de glædede sig med hende.
 59.  Og det skete på den ottende Dag, da kom de for at omskære
      Barnet; og de vilde kalde det Sakarias efter Faderens Navn.
 60.  Og hans Moder svarede og sagde: "Nej, han skal kaldes Johannes."
 61.  Og de sagde til hende: "Der er ingen i din Slægt, som kaldes med
      dette Navn."
 62.  Men de gjorde Tegn til hans Fader om, hvad han vilde, det skulde
      kaldes.
 63.  Og han forlangte en Tavle og skrev disse Ord: "Johannes er hans
      Navn." Og de undrede sig alle.
 64.  Men straks oplodes hans Mund og hans Tunge, og han talte og
      priste Gud.
 65.  Og der kom en Frygt over alle, som boede omkring dem, og alt
      dette rygtedes over hele Judæas Bjergegn.
 66.  Og alle, som hørte det, lagde sig det på Hjerte og sagde: "Hvad
      mon der skal blive af dette Barn?" Thi Herrens Hånd var med ham.

 67.  Og Sakarias, hans Fader, blev fyldt med den Helligånd, og han
      profeterede og sagde:
 68.  "Lovet være Herren, Israels Gud! thi han har besøgt og forløst
      sit Folk
 69.  og har oprejst os et Frelsens Horn" i sin Tjener Davids Hus,
 70.  således som han talte ved sine hellige Profeters Mund fra
      fordums Tid,
 71.  en Frelse fra vore Fjender og fra alle deres Hånd, som hade os,
 72.  for at gøre Barmhjertighed imod vore Fædre og ihukomme sin
      hellige Pagt,
 73.  den Ed, som han svor vor Fader Abraham, at han vilde give os,
 74.  at vi, friede fra vore Fjenders Hånd, skulde tjene ham uden
      Frygt,
 75.  i Hellighed og Retfærdighed for hans Åsyn, alle vore Dage.
 76.  Men også du, Barnlille! skal kaldes den Højestes Profet; thi du
      skal gå foran for Herrens Åsyn for at berede hans Veje,
 77.  for at give hans Folk Erkendelse af Frelse ved deres Synders
      Forladelse,
 78.  for vor Guds inderlige Barmhjertigheds Skyld, ved hvilken Lyset
      fra det høje har besøgt os
 79.  for at skinne for dem, som sidde i Mørke og i Dødens Skygge, for
      at lede vore Fødder ind på Fredens Vej,"
 80.  Men Barnet voksede og blev styrket i Ånden; og han var i
      Ørkenerne indtil den Dag, da han trådte frem for Israel.

Lukas 2

  1.  Men det skete i de dage, at en Befaling udgik fra Kejser
      Augustus, at al Verden skulde skrives i Mandtal.
  2.  (Denne første Indskrivning skete, da Kvirinius var Landshøvding
      i Syrien,)
  3.  Og alle gik for at lade sig indskrive, hver til sin By.
  4.  Og også Josef gik op fra Galilæa, fra Byen Nazareth til Judæa
      til Davids By, som kaldes Bethlehem, fordi han var af Davids Hus
      og Slægt,
  5.  for at lade sig indskrive tillige med Maria, sin trolovede, som
      var frugtsommelig.
  6.  Men det skete, medens de vare der, blev Tiden fuldkommet til, at
      hun skulde føde.
  7.  Og hun fødte sin Søn, den førstefødte, og svøbte ham og lagde
      ham i en Krybbe; thi der var ikke Rum for dem i Herberget.

  8.  Og der var Hyrder i den samme Egn, som lå ude på Marken og holdt
      Nattevagt over deres Hjord.
  9.  Og se, en Herrens Engel stod for dem, og Herrens Herlighed
      skinnede om dem, og de frygtede såre
 10.  Og Engelen sagde til dem: "Frygter ikke; thi se, jeg forkynder
      eder en stor Glæde, som skal være for hele Folket.
 11.  Thi eder er i dag en Frelser født, som er den Herre Kristus i
      Davids By.
 12.  Og dette skulle I have til Tegn: I skulle finde et Barn svøbt,
      liggende i en Krybbe."
 13.  Og straks var der med Engelen en himmelsk Hærskares
      Mangfoldighed, som lovede Gud og sagde:
 14.  "Ære være Gud i det højeste! og Fred på Jorden! i Mennesker
      Velbehag!
 15.  Og det skete, da Englene vare farne fra dem til Himmelen, sagde
      Hyrderne til hverandre: "Lader os dog gå til Bethlehem og se
      dette, som er sket, hvilket Herren har kundgjort os."
 16.  Og de skyndte sig og kom og fandt både Maria og Josef, og Barnet
      liggende i Krybben.
 17.  Men da de så det, kundgjorde de, hvad der var talt til dem om
      dette Barn.
 18.  Og alle de, som hørte det, undrede sig over det, der blev talt
      til dem af Hyrderne.
 19.  Men Maria gemte alle disse Ord og overvejede dem i sit Hjerte.
 20.  Og Hyrderne vendte tilbage, idet de priste og lovede Gud for
      alt, hvad de havde hørt og set, således som der var talt til
      dem.

 21.  Og da otte Dage vare fuldkommede, så han skulde omskæres, da
      blev hans Navn kaldt Jesus, som det var kaldt af Engelen, før
      han blev undfangen i Moders Liv.

 22.  Og da deres Renselsesdage efter Mose Lov vare fuldkommede,
      bragte de ham op til Jerusalem for at fremstille ham for Herren,
 23.  som der er skrevet i Herrens Lov, at alt Mandkøn, som åbner
      Moders Liv, skal kaldes helligt for Herren,
 24.  og for at bringe Offer efter det, som er sagt i Herrens Lov, et
      Par Turtelduer eller to unge Duer.
 25.  Og se, der var en Mand i Jerusalem ved Navn Simeon, og denne
      Mand var retfærdig og gudfrygtig og forventede Israels Trøst, og
      den Helligånd var over ham.
 26.  Og det var varslet ham af den Helligånd, at han ikke skulde se
      Døden, førend han havde set Herrens Salvede.
 27.  Og han kom af Åndens Drift til Helligdommen; og idet Forældrene
      bragte Barnet Jesus ind for at gøre med ham efter Lovens Skik,
 28.  da tog han det på sine Arme og priste Gud og sagde:
 29.  "Herre! nu lader du din Tjener fare i Fred, efter dit Ord.
 30.  Thi mine Øjne have set din Frelse,
 31.  som du beredte for alle Folkeslagenes Åsyn,
 32.  et Lys til at oplyse Hedningerne og en Herlighed for dit Folk
      Israel."
 33.  Og hans Fader og hans Moder undrede sig over de Ting, som bleve
      sagte om ham.
 34.  Og Simeon velsignede dem og sagde til hans Moder Maria: "Se,
      denne er sat mange i Israel til Fald og Oprejsning og til et
      Tegn, som imodsiges,
 35.  ja, også din egen Sjæl skal et Sværd gennemtrænge! for at mange
      Hjerters Tanker skulle åbenbares."
 36.  Og der var en Profetinde Anna, Fanuels Datter, af Asers Stamme;
      hun var meget fremrykket i Alder, havde levet syv År med sin
      Mand efter sin Jomfrustand
 37.  og var nu en Enke ved fire og firsindstyve År, og hun veg ikke
      fra Helligdommen, tjenende Gud med Faste og Bønner Nat og Dag.
 38.  Og hun trådte til i den samme Stund og priste Gud og talte om
      ham til alle, som forventede Jerusalems Forløsning.
 39.  Og da de havde fuldbyrdet alle Ting efter Herrens Lov, vendte de
      tilbage til Galilæa til deres egen By Nazareth.
 40.  Men Barnet voksede og blev stærkt og blev fuldt af Visdom: og
      Guds Nåde var over det.

 41.  Og hans Forældre droge hvert År op til Jerusalem på
      Påskehøjtiden.
 42.  Og da han var bleven tolv År gammel, og de gik op efter
      Højtidens Sædvane
 43.  og havde tilendebragt de Dage, blev Barnet Jesus i Jerusalem,
      medens de droge hjem, og hans Forældre mærkede det ikke.
 44.  Men da de mente, at han var i Rejsefølget, kom de en Dags Rejse
      frem, og de ledte efter ham iblandt deres Slægtninge og
      Kyndinge.
 45.  Og da de ikke fandt ham, vendte de tilbage til Jerusalem og
      ledte efter ham.
 46.  Og det skete efter tre Dage, da fandt de ham i Helligdommen,
      hvor han sad midt iblandt Lærerne og både hørte på dem og
      adspurgte dem.
 47.  Men alle, som hørte ham, undrede sig såre over hans Forstand og
      Svar.
 48.  Og da de så ham, bleve de forfærdede; og hans Moder sagde til
      ham:"Barn! hvorfor gjorde du således imod os? Se, din Fader og
      jeg have ledt efter dig med Smerte."
 49.  Og han sagde til dem: "Hvorfor ledte I efter mig? Vidste I ikke,
      at jeg bør være i min Faders Gerning?"
 50.  Og de forstode ikke det Ord, som han talte til dem.
 51.  Og han drog ned med dem og kom til Nazareth og var dem lydig og
      hans Moder gemte alle de Ord i sit Hjerte.
 52.  Og Jesus forfremmedes i Visdom og Alder og yndest hos Gud og
      Mennesker.

Lukas 3

  1.  Men i Kejser Tiberius's femtende Regeringsår, da Pontius Pilatus
      var Landshøvding i Judæa, og Herodes var Fjerdingsfyrste i
      Galilæa, og hans Broder Filip var Fjerdingsfyrste i Ituræa og
      Trakonitis's Land og Lysanias Fjerdingsfyrste i Abilene,
  2.  medens Annas og Kajfas vare Ypperstepræster, kom Guds Ord til
      Johannes, Sakarias's Søn, i Ørkenen.
  3.  Og han gik ud i hele Omegnen om Jordan og prædikede
      Omvendelses-Dåb til Syndernes Forladelse,
  4.  som der er skrevet i Profeten Esajas's Talers Bog: "Der er en
      Røst af en, som råber i Ørkenen: Bereder Herrens Vej, gører hans
      Stier jævne;
  5.  hver Dal skal opfyldes, og hvert Bjerg og Høj skal nedtrykkes,
      og det krumme skal gøres lige, og de ujævne Veje skulle gøres
      jævne;
  6.  og alt Kød skal se Guds Frelse."
  7.  Han sagde altså til de Skarer, som gik ud for at døbes af ham:
      "I Øgleunger! hvem har lært eder at fly fra den kommende Vrede?
  8.  Bærer da Frugter, som ere Omvendelsen værdige, og begynder ikke
      at sige ved eder selv: Vi have Abraham til Fader; thi jeg siger
      eder, at Gud kan opvække Abraham Børn af disse Sten.
  9.  Men Øksen ligger også allerede ved Roden af Træerne; så bliver
      da hvert Træ, som ikke bærer god Frugt, omhugget og kastet i
      Ilden."
 10.  Og Skarerne spurgte ham og sagde: "Hvad skulle vi da gøre?"
 11.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Den, som har to Kjortler,
      dele med den, som ingen har; og den, som har Mad, gøre ligeså!"
 12.  Men også Toldere kom for at døbes, og de sagde til ham: "Mester!
      hvad skulle vi gøre?"
 13.  Men han sagde til dem: "Kræver intet ud over, hvad eder er
      forordnet."
 14.  Men også Krigsfolk spurgte ham og sagde: "Hvad skulle vi da
      gøre?" Og han sagde til dem: "Øver ikke Vold imod nogen, bruger
      ikke Underfundighed imod nogen, og lader eder nøje med eders
      Sold!"
 15.  Men da Folket var i Forventning, og alle tænkte i deres Hjerter
      om Johannes, om ikke han skulde være Kristus,
 16.  da svarede Johannes og sagde til alle: "Jeg døber eder med Vand;
      men den kommer, som er stærkere end jeg, og hvis Skotvinge jeg
      ikke er værdig at løse; han skal døbe eder med den Helligånd og
      Ild.
 17.  Hans Kasteskovl er i hans Hånd, for at han skal gennemrense sin
      Lo og sanke Hveden i sin Lade, men Avnerne skal han opbrænde med
      uslukkelig Ild."
 18.  Ligeså formanede han også Folket om mange andre Ting og
      forkyndte dem Evangeliet.
 19.  Men da Fjerdingsfyrsten Herodes blev revset af ham for hans
      Broders Hustru, Herodias's Skyld og for alt det onde, som
      Herodes gjorde,
 20.  så føjede han til alt det øvrige også dette, at han kastede
      Johannes i Fængsel.

 21.  Men medens hele Folket blev døbt, skete det, da også Jesus var
      bleven døbt og bad, at Himmelen åbnedes,
 22.  og at den Helligånd dalede ned over ham i legemlig Skikkelse som
      en Due, og at en Røst lød fra Himmelen: "Du er min Søn, den
      elskede, i dig har jeg Velbehag."

 23.  Og Jesus selv var omtrent tredive År, da han begyndte, og han
      var, som man holdt for, en Søn af Josef Elis Søn,
 24.  Matthats Søn, Levis Søn, Melkis Søn, Jannajs Søn, Josefs Søn,
 25.  Mattathias's Søn, Amos's Søn, Naums Søn, Eslis Søn, Naggajs Søn,
 26.  Måths Søn, Mattathias's Søn, Semeis Søn, Josefs Søn, Judas Søn,
 27.  Joanans Søn, Resas Søn, Zorobabels Søn; Salathiels Søn, Neris
      Søn.
 28.  Melkis Søn, Addis Søn, Kosams Søn, Elmadams Søn, Ers Søn,
 29.  Jesu Søn, Eliezers Søn, Jorims Søn, Matthats Søn, Levis Søn,
 30.  Simeons Søn, Judas Søn, Josets Søn, Jonams Søn, Eliakims Søn,
 31.  Meleas Søn, Mennas Søn, Mattathas Søn, Nathans Søn, Davids Søn,
 32.  Isajs Søn, Obeds Søn, Boos's Søn, Salmons Søn, Nassons Søn,
 33.  Aminadabs Søn, Arams Søn, Esroms Søn, Fares's Søn, Judas Søn,
 34.  Jakobs Søn, Isaks Søn, Abrahams Søn, Tharas Søn, Nakors Sn,
 35.  Seruks Søn, Ragaus Søn, Faleks Søn, Ebers Søn, Salas Søn,
 36.  Kajnans Søn, Arfaksads Søn, Sems Søn, Noas Søn, Lameks Søn,
 37.  Methusalas Søn, Enoks Søn, Jareds Søn, Maleleels Søn, Kajnans
      Søn,
 38.  Enos's Søn, Seths Søn, Adams Søn, Guds Søn.

Lukas 4

  1.  Men Jesus vendte tilbage fra Jorden fuld af den Helligånd og
      blev ført af Ånden i Ørkenen
  2.  i fyrretyve Dage, medens han blev fristet af Djævelen. Og han
      spiste intet i de Dage; og da de havde Ende, blev han hungrig.
  3.  Og Djævelen sagde til ham: "Dersom du er Guds Søn, da sig til
      denne Sten, at den skal blive Brød."
  4.  Og Jesus svarede ham: "Der er skrevet: Mennesket skal ikke leve
      af Brød alene."
  5.  Og han førte ham op og viste ham alle Verdens Riger i et
      øjeblik.
  6.  Og Djævelen sagde til ham: "Dig vil jeg give hele denne Magt og
      deres Herlighed; thi den er mig overgiven, og jeg giver den, til
      hvem jeg vil.
  7.  Dersom du altså vil tilbede mig, skal den helt tilhøre dig."
  8.  Og Jesus svarede ham og sagde: "Der er skrevet: Du skal tilbede
      Herren din Gud og tjene ham alene."
  9.  Og han førte ham til Jerusalem og stillede ham på Helligdommens
      Tinde og sagde til ham: "Dersom du er Guds Søn, da kast dig ned
      herfra;
 10.  thi der er skrevet: Han skal give sine Engle Befaling om dig, at
      de skulle bevare dig,
 11.  og at de skulle bære dig på Hænderne, for at du ikke skal støde
      din Fod på nogen Sten."
 12.  Og Jesus svarede og sagde til ham: "Der er sagt: Du må ikke
      friste Herren din Gud."
 13.  Og da Djævelen havde endt al Fristelse, veg han fra ham til en
      Tid.

 14.  Og Jesus vendte i Åndens Kraft tilbage til Galilæa, og Rygtet om
      ham kom ud i hele det omliggende Land.
 15.  Og selv lærte han i deres Synagoger og blev prist af alle.
 16.  Og han kom til Nazareth, hvor han var opfødt, og gik efter sin
      Sædvane på Sabbatsdagen ind i Synagogen og stod op for at
      forelæse.
 17.  Og man gav ham Profeten Esajas's Bog, og da han slog Bogen op;
      fandt han det Sted, hvor der stod skrevet:
 18.  "Herrens Ånd er over mig, fordi han salvede mig til at forkynde
      Evangelium for fattige; han har sendt mig for at forkynde
      fangne, at de skulle lades løs, og blinde, at de skulle få deres
      Syn, for at sætte plagede i Frihed,
 19.  for at forkynde et Herrens Nådeår."
 20.  Og han lukkede Bogen sammen og gav Tjeneren den igen og satte
      sig; og alles Øjne i Synagogen stirrede på ham.
 21.  Men han begyndte at sige til dem: "I Dag er dette Skriftord gået
      i Opfyldelse for eders Øren."
 22.  Og de berømmede ham alle og undrede sig over de livsalige Ord,
      som udgik af hans Mund, og de sagde: "Er dette ikke Josefs Søn?"
 23.  Og han sagde til dem: "I ville sikkerlig sige mig dette
      Ordsprog: Læge! læg dig selv; gør også her i din Fædreneby
      så. store Ting, som vi have hørt ere skete i Kapernaum."
 24.  Men han sagde: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, at ingen Profet er
      anerkendt i sit Fædreland.
 25.  Men jeg siger eder i Sandhed: Der var mange Enker i Israel i
      Elias's Dage, da Himmelen var lukket i tre År og seks Måneder,
      den Gang der var en stor Hunger i hele Landet;
 26.  og til ingen af dem blev Elias sendt uden til Sarepta ved Sidon
      til en Enke.
 27.  Og der var mange spedalske i Israel på Profeten Elisas Tid, og
      ingen af dem blev renset, uden Syreren Naman."
 28.  Og alle, som vare i Synagogen, bleve fulde af Harme, da de hørte
      dette.
 29.  Og de stode op og stødte ham ud af Byen og førte ham hen til
      Skrænten af det Bjerg, på hvilket deres By var bygget, for at
      styrte ham ned.
 30.  Men han gik igennem, midt imellem dem, og drog bort.

 31.  Og han kom ned til Kapernaum, en By i Galilæa, og lærte dem på
      Sabbaterne.
 32.  Og de bleve slagne af Forundring over hans Lære, thi hans Tale
      var med Myndighed.
 33.  Og i Synagogen var der et Menneske, som havde en uren ond Ånd,
      og han råbte med høj Røst:
 34.  "Ak! hvad have vi med dig at gøre, Jesus af Nazareth? Er du
      kommen for at ødelægge os? Jeg kender dig, hvem du er, du Guds
      hellige."
 35.  Og Jesus truede ham og sagde: "Ti, og far ud af ham!" Og den
      onde Ånd kastede ham ind imellem dem og for ud af ham uden at
      have gjort ham nogen Skade.
 36.  Og der kom en Rædsel over alle; og de talte med hverandre og
      sagde "Hvad er dog dette for et Ord; thi han byder over de urene
      Ånder med Myndighed og Kraft, og de fare ud?"
 37.  Og Rygtet om ham udbredtes alle Vegne i det omliggende Land.

 38.  Men han stod op og gik fra Synagogen ind i Simons Hus; og Simons
      Svigermoder plagedes at en stærk Feber; og de bade ham for
      hende.
 39.  Og han stillede sig hen over hende og truede Feberen, og den
      forlod hende. Men hun stod straks op og vartede dem op.
 40.  Men da Solen gik ned, førte alle de, som havde syge med alle
      Hånde Svagheder, dem til ham; og han lagde Hænderne på hver
      enkelt af dem og helbredte dem
 41.  Også onde Ånder fore ud al mange, råbte og sagde: "Du er Guds
      Søn;" og han truede dem og tillod dem ikke at tale, fordi de
      vidste, at han var Kristus.

 42.  Men da det var blevet Dag, gik han ud og drog til et øde Sted;
      og Skarerne ledte efter ham; og de kom hen til ham, og de holdt
      på ham, for at han ikke skulde gå fra dem.
 43.  Men han sagde til dem: "Også for de andre Byer bør jeg forkynde
      Evangeliet om Guds Rige; thi dertil blev jeg udsendt."
 44.  Og han prædikede i Galilæas Synagoger.

Lukas 5

  1.  Men det skete, da Folkeskaren trængte sig sammen om ham og hørte
      Guds Ord, og han stod ved Genezareths Sø,
  2.  da så han to Skibe stå ved Søen; men Fiskerne vare gåede fra dem
      og toede Garnene.
  3.  Og han gik om Bord i et af Skibene, som var Simons, og bad ham
      at lægge lidt fra Land; og han satte sig og lærte Skarerne fra
      Skibet.
  4.  Men da han holdt op med at tale, sagde han til Simon: "Far ud på
      Dybet, og kaster eders Garn ud til en Dræt!"
  5.  Og Simon svarede og sagde til ham: "Mester! vi have arbejdet
      hele Natten og fik intet; men på dit Ord vil jeg kaste Garnene
      ud."
  6.  Og da de gjorde det, fangede de en stor Mængde Fisk, og deres
      Garn sønderreves.
  7.  Og de vinkede ad deres Staldbrødre i det andet Skib, at de
      skulde komme og hjælpe dem; og de kom og de fyldte begge
      Skibene, så at de var nær ved at synke.
  8.  Men da Simon Peter så det, faldt han ned for Jesu Knæ og sagde:
      "Gå bort fra mig, thi jeg er en syndig Mand, Herre!"
  9.  Thi en Rædsel var påkommen ham og alle dem, som vare med ham,
      over den Fiskedræt, som de havde fået;
 10.  ligeledes også Jakob og Johannes, Zebedæus's Sønner, som vare
      Simons Staldbrødre. Og Jesus sagde til Simon: "Frygt ikke, fra
      nu af skal du fange Mennesker."
 11.  Og de lagde Skibene til Land og forlode alle Ting og fulgte ham.

 12.  Og det skete, medens han var i en af Byerne, se, da var der en
      Mand fuld af Spedalskhed; og da han så Jesus, faldt han på sit
      Ansigt, bad ham og sagde: "Herre! om du vil, kan du rense mig."
 13.  Og han udrakte Hånden og rørte ved ham og sagde: "Jeg vil; bliv
      ren!" Og straks forlod Spedalskheden ham.
 14.  Og han bød ham, at han skulde ikke sige det til nogen, men "gå
      bort, og fremstil dig for Præsten, og offer for din Renselse,
      således som Moses har befalet, til Vidnesbyrd for dem!"
 15.  Men Rygtet om ham udbredte sig end mere, og store Skarer kom
      sammen for at høre og for at helbredes for deres Sygdomme.
 16.  Men han gik bort til Ørkenerne og bad.

 17.  Og det skete en af de Dage, at han lærte, og der sad Farisæere
      og Lovlærere, som vare komne fra enhver Landsby i Galilæa og
      Judæa og fra Jerusalem; og Herrens Kraft var hos ham til at
      helbrede.
 18.  Og se, nogle Mænd bare på en Seng en Mand, som var værkbruden,
      og de søgte at bære ham ind og lægge ham foran ham.
 19.  Og da de ikke fandt nogen Vej til at bære ham ind for Skarens
      Skyld, stege de op oven på Taget og firede ham tillige med
      Sengen ned imellem Tagstenene midt iblandt dem foran Jesus.
 20.  Og da han så deres Tro, sagde han: "Menneske! dine Synder ere
      dig forladte."
 21.  Og de skriftkloge og Farisæerne begyndte at tænke således ved
      sig selv: "Hvem er denne, som taler Gudsbespottelser? Hvem kan
      forlade Synder, uden Gud alene?"
 22.  Men da Jesus kendte deres Tanker, svarede han og sagde til dem:
      "Hvad tænke I på i eders Hjerter?
 23.  Hvilket er lettest at sige: Dine Synder ere dig forladte? eller
      at sige: Stå op og gå?
 24.  Men for at I skulle vide, at Menneskesønnen har Magt på Jorden
      til at forlade Synder," så sagde han til den værkbrudne: "Jeg
      siger dig, stå op, og tag din Seng, og gå til dit Hus!"
 25.  Og han stod straks op for deres Øjne og tog det, som han lå på,
      og gik hen til sit Hus og priste Gud.
 26.  Og Forfærdelse betog alle, og de priste Gud; og de bleve fulde
      af Frygt og sagde: "Vi have i Dag set utrolige Ting."

 27.  Og derefter gik han ud og så en Tolder ved Navn Levi sidde ved
      Toldboden, og han sagde til ham: "Følg mig!"
 28.  Og han forlod alle Ting og stod op og fulgte ham.
 29.  Og Levi gjorde et stort Gæstebud for ham i sit Hus; og der var
      en stor Skare af Toldere og andre, som sade til Bords med dem.
 30.  Og Farisæerne og deres Skriftkloge knurrede imod hans Disciple
      og sagde: "Hvorfor spise og drikke I med Toldere og Syndere?"
 31.  Og Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "De raske trænge ikke til
      Læge, men de syge.
 32.  Jeg er ikke kommen for at kalde retfærdige, men Syndere til
      Omvendelse."

 33.  Men de sagde til ham: "Johannes's Disciple faste ofte og holde
      Bønner og Farisæernes ligeså; men dine spise og drikke?"
 34.  Men Jesus sagde til dem: "Kunne I vel få Brudesvendene til at
      faste, så længe Brudgommen er hos dem?
 35.  Men der skal komme Dage, da Brudgommen bliver tagen fra dem; da
      skulle de faste i de Dage."
 36.  Men han sagde også en Lignelse til dem: "Ingen river en Lap af
      et nyt Klædebon og sætter den på et gammelt Klædebon; ellers
      river han både det nye sønder, og Lappen fra det nye vil ikke
      passe til det gamle.
 37.  Og ingen kommer ung Vin på gammle Læderflasker; ellers sprænger
      den unge Vin Læderflaskerne, og den spildes, og Læderflaskerne
      ødelægges.
 38.  Men man skal komme ung Vin på nye Læderflasker, så blive de
      begge bevarede.
 39.  Og ingen, som har drukket den gamle, vil have den unge; thi han
      siger: Den gamle er god."

Lukas 6

  1.  Men det skete på den næstførste Sabbat, at han vandrede igennem
      en Sædemark, og hans Disciple plukkede Aks og gned dem med
      Hænderne og spiste.
  2.  Men nogle af Farisæerne sagde: "Hvorfor gøre I, hvad det ikke er
      tilladt at gøre på Sabbaten?"
  3.  Og Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Have I da ikke læst, hvad
      David gjorde, da han blev hungrig, han og de, som vare med ham?
  4.  hvorledes han gik ind i Guds Hus og tog Skuebrødene og spiste og
      gav også dem, som vare med ham, skønt det ikke er nogen tilladt
      at spise dem uden Præsterne alene."
  5.  Og han sagde til dem: "Menneskesønnen er Herre også over
      Sabbaten."

  6.  Men det skete på en anden Sabbat, at han kom ind i Synagogen og
      lærte. Og der var der en Mand, hvis højre Hånd var vissen.
  7.  Men de skriftkloge og Farisæerne toge Vare på ham, om han vilde
      helbrede på Sabbaten, for at de kunde finde noget at anklage ham
      for.
  8.  Men han vidste deres Tanker; og han sagde til Manden, som havde
      den visne Hånd: "Rejs dig og stå frem her i Midten!" Og han
      rejste sig og stod frem.
  9.  Men Jesus sagde til dem: "Jeg spørger eder, om det er tilladt at
      gøre godt på Sabbaten eller at gøre ondt, at frelse Liv eller at
      ødelægge det?"
 10.  Og han så omkring på dem alle og sagde til ham: "Ræk din Hånd
      ud!" Og han gjorde det; da blev hans Hånd sund igen som den
      anden.
 11.  Men de bleve fulde af Raseri og talte med hverandre om, hvad de
      skulde gøre ved Jesus.

 12.  Men det skete i disse Dage, at han gik ud på et Bjerg for at
      bede; og han tilbragte Natten i Bøn til Gud.
 13.  Og da det blev Dag, hidkaldte han sine Disciple og udvalgte tolv
      af dem, hvilke han også kaldte Apostle:
 14.  Simon, hvem han også kaldte Peter, og Andreas, hans Broder, og
      Jakob og Johannes og Filip og Bartholomæus
 15.  og Matthæus og Thomas, Jakob, Alfæus's Søn, og Simon, som kaldes
      Zelotes,
 16.  Judas, Jakobs Søn, og Judas Iskariot, som blev Forræder.

 17.  Og han gik ned med dem og stod på et jævnt Sted, og der var en
      Skare af hans Disciple og en stor Mængde af Folket fra hele
      Judæa og Jerusalem og Kysten ved Tyrus og Sidon,
 18.  som vare komne for at høre ham og helbredes for deres Sygdomme.
      Og de plagede bleve helbredte fra urene Ånder;
 19.  og hele Skaren søgte at røre ved ham; thi en Kraft gik ud fra
      ham og helbredte alle.

 20.  Og han opløftede sine Øjne på sine Disciple og sagde: "Salige
      ere I fattige, thi eders er Guds Rige.
 21.  Salige ere I, som nu hungre, thi I skulle mættes. Salige ere I,
      som nu græde, thi I skulle le.
 22.  Salige er I, når Menneskene hade eder, og når de udstøde eder og
      håne eder og forkaste eders Navn som ondt for Menneskesønnens
      Skyld.
 23.  Glæder eder på den Dag og jubler; thi se, eders Løn er stor i
      Himmelen. Thi på samme Måde gjorde deres Fædre ved Profeterne.
 24.  Men ve eder, I rige, thi I have allerede fået eders Trøst.
 25.  Ve eder, I, som nu ere mætte, thi I skulle hungre. Ve eder, I,
      som nu le, thi I skulle sørge og græde.
 26.  Ve eder, når alle Mennesker tale godt om eder; thi på samme Måde
      gjorde deres Fædre ved de falske Profeter.

 27.  Men jeg siger eder, I, som høre: Elsker eders Fjender, gører dem
      godt, som hade eder;
 28.  velsigner dem, som forbande eder, og beder for dem, som krænke
      eder.
 29.  Den, som slår dig på den ene Kind, byd ham også den anden til;
      og den, som tager Kappen fra dig, formen ham heller ikke
      Kjortelen!
 30.  Giv enhver, som beder dig; og af den, som tager, hvad dit er,
      kræve du det ikke igen!
 31.  Og som I ville, at Menneskene skulle gøre imod eder, ligeså
      skulle også I gøre imod dem!
 32.  Og dersom I elske dem, som elske eder, hvad Tak have I derfor?
      Thi også Syndere elske dem, som dem elske.
 33.  Og dersom I gøre vel imod dem, der gøre vel imod eder, hvad Tak
      have I derfor? Thi også Syndere gøre det samme.
 34.  Og dersom I låne dem, af hvem I håbe at få igen, hvad Tak have I
      derfor? Thi også Syndere låne Syndere for at få lige igen.
 35.  Men elsker eders Fjender, og gører vel, og låner uden at vente
      noget derfor, så skal eders Løn være stor, og I skulle være den
      Højestes Børn; thi han er god imod de utaknemmelige og onde.
 36.  Vorder barmhjertige, ligesom eders Fader er barmhjertig.

 37.  Og dømmer ikke, så skulle I ikke dømmes; fordømmer ikke, så
      skulle I ikke fordømmes; forlader, så skal der forlades eder;
 38.  giver, så skal der gives eder. Et godt, knuget, rystet, topfuldt
      Mål skulle de give i eders Skød; thi med hvad Mål I måle, skal
      der tilmåles eder igen."
 39.  Men han sagde dem også en Lignelse: "Mon en blind kan lede en
      blind? Ville de ikke begge falde i Graven?
 40.  En Discipel er ikke over sin Mester; men enhver, som er fuldt
      færdig, skal være som sin Mester.
 41.  Men hvorfor ser du Skæven, som er i din Broders Øje; men
      Bjælken, som er i dit eget Øje, bliver du ikke var?
 42.  Eller hvorledes kan du sige til din Broder: Broder! lad mig
      drage Skæven ud, som er i dit Øje, du, som ikke ser Bjælken i
      dit eget Øje?  Du Hykler! drag først Bjælken ud af dit Øje, og
      da kan du se klart til at drage Skæven ud, som er i din Broders
      Øje.

 43.  Thi der er intet godt Træ, som bærer rådden Frugt, og intet
      råddent Træ, som bærer god Frugt
 44.  Thi hvert Træ kendes på sin egen Frugt; thi man sanker ikke
      Figener af Torne, ikke heller plukker man Vindruer af en
      Tornebusk.
 45.  Et godt Menneske fremfører det gode af sit Hjertes gode Forråd,
      og et ondt Menneske fremfører det onde af sit onde Forråd; thi
      af Hjertets Overflødighed taler hans Mund.

 46.  Men hvorfor kalde I mig Herre, Herre! og gøre ikke, hvad jeg
      siger?
 47.  Hver den, som kommer til mig og hører mine Ord og gør efter dem,
      hvem han er lig, skal jeg vise eder.
 48.  Han er lig et Menneske, der byggede et Hus og gravede i Dybden
      og lagde Grundvolden på Klippen; men da en Oversvømmelse kom,
      styrtede Floden imod det Hus, og den kunde ikke ryste det; thi
      det var bygget godt.
 49.  Men den, som hører og ikke gør derefter, han er lig et Menneske,
      der byggede et Hus på Jorden, uden Grundvold; og Floden styrtede
      imod det, og det faldt straks sammen, og dette Hus's Fald blev
      stort."

Lukas 7

  1.  Men da han havde fuldendt alle sine Ord i Folkets Påhør, gik han
      ind i Kapernaum.
  2.  Men en Høvedsmands Tjener, som denne holdt meget af, var syg og
      nær ved at dø.
  3.  men da han hørte om Jesus, sendte han nogle af Jødernes Ældste
      til ham og bad ham om, at han vilde komme og helbrede hans
      Tjener.
  4.  Men da de kom til Jesus, bade de ham indtrængende og sagde: "Han
      er vel værd, at du gør dette for ham;
  5.  thi han elsker vort Folk, og han har bygget Synagogen for os."
  6.  Og Jesus gik med dem. Men da han allerede ikke var langt fra
      Huset, sendte Høvedsmanden nogle Venner og lod ham sige: "Herre!
      umag dig ikke; thi jeg er ikke værdig til, at du skal gå ind
      under mit Tag.
  7.  Derfor agtede jeg heller ikke mig selv værdig til at komme til
      dig; men sig det med et Ord, så bliver min Dreng helbredt.
  8.  Jeg er jo selv et Menneske, som står under Øvrighed og har
      Stridsmænd under mig; og siger jeg til den ene: Gå! så går han;
      og til den anden: Kom! så kommer han; og til min Tjener: Gør
      dette!  så gør han det."
  9.  Men da Jesus hørte dette, forundrede han sig over ham; og han
      vendte sig om og sagde til Skaren, som fulgte ham: "Jeg siger
      eder, end ikke i Israel har jeg fundet så stor en Tro."
 10.  Og da de, som vare udsendte, kom tilbage til Huset, fandt de den
      syge Tjener sund.

 11.  Og det skete Dagen derefter, at han gik til en By, som hed Nain,
      og der gik mange af hans Disciple og en stor Skare med ham.
 12.  Men da han nærmede sig Byens Port, se, da blev en død båren ud,
      som var sin Moders enbårne Søn, og hun var Enke; og en stor
      Skare fra Byen gik med hende.
 13.  Og da Herren så hende, ynkedes han inderligt over hende og sagde
      til hende: "Græd ikke!"
 14.  Og han trådte til og rørte ved Båren; men de, som bare, stode
      stille, og han sagde: "du unge Mand, jeg siger dig, stå op!"
 15.  Og den døde rejste sig op og begyndte at tale; og han gav ham
      til hans Moder.
 16.  Men Frygt betog alle, og de priste Gud og sagde: "Der er en stor
      Profet oprejst iblandt os, og Gud har besøgt sit Folk."
 17.  Og denne Tale om ham kom ud i hele Judæa og i hele det
      omliggende Land.

 18.  Og Johannes's Disciple fortalte ham om alt dette. Og Johannes
      kaldte to af sine Disciple til sig
 19.  og sendte dem til Herren og lod sige: "Er du den, som kommer,
      eller skulle vi vente en anden?"
 20.  Og da Mændene kom til ham, sagde de: "Johannes Døberen har sendt
      os til dig og lader sige: Er du den, som kommer, eller skulle vi
      vente en anden?"
 21.  I den samme Time helbredte han mange for Sygdomme og Plager og
      onde Ånder og skænkede mange blinde Synet.
 22.  Og han svarede og sagde til dem: "Går hen, og forkynder Johannes
      de Ting, som I have set og hørt: Blinde se, lamme gå, spedalske
      renses, døve høre, døde stå op, Evangeliet forkyndes for
      fattige;
 23.  og salig er den, som ikke forarges på mig."
 24.  Men da Johannes's Sendebud vare gåede bort, begyndte han at sige
      til Skarerne om Johannes: "Hvad gik I ud i Ørkenen at skue? Et
      Rør, som bevæges hid og did af Vinden?
 25.  Eller hvad gik I ud at se? Et Menneske, iført bløde Klæder? Se,
      de, som leve i prægtige Klæder og i Vellevned, ere i
      Kongsgårdene.
 26.  Eller hvad gik I ud at se? En Profet? Ja, siger jeg eder, endog
      mere end en Profet!
 27.  Han er den, om hvem der er skrevet: Se, jeg sender min Engel for
      dit Ansigt, han skal berede din Vej foran dig.
 28.  Jeg siger eder: Iblandt dem, som ere fødte af Kvinder, er ingen
      større Profet end Johannes; men den mindste i Guds Rige er
      større end han.
 29.  Og hele Folket, som hørte ham, endog Tolderne, gav Gud Ret, idet
      de bleve døbte med Johannes's Dåb.
 30.  Men Farisæerne og de lovkyndige have foragtet Guds Råd med dem
      selv, idet de ikke bleve døbte af ham.

 31.  Ved hvem skal jeg da ligne denne Slægts Mennesker? og hvem ligne
      de?
 32.  De ligne Børn, som sidde på Torvet og råbe til hverandre og
      sige: Vi blæste på Fløjte for eder, og I dansede ikke, vi sang
      Klagesange for eder, og I græd ikke.
 33.  Thi Johannes Døberen kom, som hverken spiste Brød eller drak
      Vin, og I sige: Han er besat.
 34.  Menneskesønnen kom, som spiser og drikker, og I sige: Se, en
      Frådser og en Vindranker, Tolderes og Synderes Ven!
 35.  Dog Visdommen er retfærdiggjort ved alle sine Børn!"

 36.  Men en af Farisæerne bad ham om, at han vilde spise med ham; og
      han gik ind i Farisæerens Hus og satte sig til Bords.
 37.  Og se, der var en Kvinde, som var en Synderinde i Byen; da hun
      fik at vide, at han sad til Bords i Farisæerens Hus, kom hun med
      en Alabastkrukke med Salve;
 38.  og hun stillede sig bag ved ham, ved hans Fødder og græd og
      begyndte at væde hans Fødder med sine Tårer og aftørrede dem med
      sit Hovedhår og kyssede hans Fødder og salvede dem med Salven.
 39.  Men da Farisæeren, som havde indbudt ham, så det, sagde han ved
      sig selv: "Dersom denne var en Profet, vidste han, hvem og
      hvordan en Kvinde denne er, som rører ved ham, at hun er en
      Synderinde."
 40.  Og Jesus tog til Orde og sagde til ham: "Simon! jeg har noget at
      sige dig." Men han siger: "Mester, sig frem!"
 41.  "En Mand, som udlånte Penge, havde to Skyldnere; den ene var fem
      Hundrede Denarer skyldig. men den anden halvtredsindstyve.
 42.  Da de ikke havde noget at betale med, eftergav han dem det
      begge.  Hvem af dem vil nu elske ham mest?"
 43.  Simon svarede og sagde: "Jeg holder for, den, hvem han eftergav
      mest?" Men han sagde til ham: "Du dømte ret."
 44.  Og han vendte sig imod Kvinden og sagde til Simon: "Ser du denne
      Kvinde? Jeg kom ind i dit Hus; du gav mig ikke Vand til mine
      Fødder; men hun vædede mine Fødder med sine Tårer og aftørrede
      dem med sit Hår.
 45.  Du gav mig intet Kys; men hun ophørte ikke med at kysse mine
      Fødder, fra jeg kom herind.
 46.  Du salvede ikke mit Hoved med Olie; men hun salvede mine Fødder
      med Salve.
 47.  Derfor siger jeg dig: Hendes mange Synder ere hende forladte,
      eftersom hun elskede meget; men den, hvem lidet forlades, elsker
      lidet."
 48.  Men han sagde til hende: "Dine Synder ere forladte!"
 49.  Og de, som sade til Bords med ham, begyndte at sige ved sig
      selv: "Hvem er denne, som endog forlader Synder?"
 50.  Men han sagde til Kvinden: "Din Tro har frelst dig, gå bort med
      Fred!"

Lukas 8

  1.  Og det skete i Tiden der efter, at han rejste igennem Byer og
      Landsbyer og prædikede og forkyndte Evangeliet om Guds Rige, og
      med ham de tolv
  2.  og nogle Kvinder, som vare helbredte fra onde Ånder og Sygdomme,
      nemlig: Maria, der kaldes Magdalene, af hvem syv onde Ånder vare
      udfarne;
  3.  og Johanna, Herodes's Husfoged Kuzas Hustru, og Susanna og mange
      andre, som tjente dem med, hvad de ejede.

  4.  Men da en stor Skare kom sammen, og de droge til ham fra de
      forskellige Byer, sagde han ved en Lignelse:
  5.  "En Sædemand gik ud at så sin Sæd; og idet han såede, faldt
      noget ved Vejen og blev nedtrådt, og Himmelens Fugle åde det op.
  6.  Og noget faldt på Klippen; og da det voksede op, visnede det,
      fordi det ikke havde Væde.
  7.  Og noget faldt midt iblandt Torne, og Tornene voksede op med og
      kvalte det.
  8.  Og noget faldt i den gode Jord, og det voksede op og bar
      hundrede Fold Frugt." Da han sagde dette, råbte han: "Den, som
      har Øren at høre med, han høre!"

  9.  Men hans Disciple spurgte ham, hvad denne Lignelse skulde
      betyde.
 10.  Og han sagde: "Eder er det givet at kende Guds Riges
      Hemmeligheder, men de andre i Lignelser, for at de, skønt
      seende, ikke skulle se, og, skønt hørende, ikke skulle forstå.

 11.  Men dette er Lignelsen: Sæden er Guds Ord.
 12.  Men de ved Vejen ere de, som høre det; derefter kommer Djævelen
      og tager Ordet bort af deres Hjerte, for at de ikke skulle tro
      og blive frelste.
 13.  Men de på Klippen ere de, som modtage Ordet med Glæde, når de
      høre det, og disse have ikke Rod; de tro til en Tid og falde fra
      i Fristelsens Tid.
 14.  Men det, som faldt iblandt Torne, det er dem, som have hørt og
      så gå hen og kvæles under Livets Bekymringer og Rigdom og
      Nydelser og ikke bære moden Frugt.
 15.  Men det i den gode Jord, det er dem, som, når de have hørt
      Ordet, beholde det i et smukt og godt Hjerte og bære Frugt i
      Udholdenhed.

 16.  Men ingen, som tænder et Lys, skjuler det med et Kar eller
      sætter det under en Bænk; men han sætter det på en Lysestage,
      for at de, som komme ind, kunne se Lyset.
 17.  Thi der er ikke noget skjult, som jo skal blive åbenbart; og
      ikke noget lønligt, som jo skal blive kendt og komme for Lyset.
 18.  Ser derfor til, hvorledes I høre; thi den, som har, ham skal der
      gives; og den, som ikke har, fra ham skal endog det tages, han
      synes at have."

 19.  Men hans Moder og Brødre kom til ham og kunde ikke nå frem til
      ham for Skaren.
 20.  Og det blev ham meddelt: "Din Moder og dine Brødre stå udenfor
      og begære at se dig."
 21.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Min Moder og mine Brødre ere
      disse, som høre Guds Ord og gøre efter det."

 22.  Og det skete en af de Dage, at han gik om Bord i et Skib tillige
      med sine Disciple, og han sagde til dem: "Lader os fare over til
      hin Side af Søen;" og de sejlede ud.
 23.  Men medens de sejlede, faldt han i Søvn; og en Stormvind for ned
      over Søen, og Skibet blev fuldt af Vand, og de vare i Fare.
 24.  Da trådte de hen og vækkede ham og sagde: "Mester, Mester! vi
      forgå." Men han stod op og truede Vinden og Vandets Bølger; og
      de lagde sig, og det blev blikstille.
 25.  Og han sagde til dem: "Hvor, er eders Tro?" Men de frygtede og
      undrede sig, og sagde til hverandre: "Hvem er dog denne, siden
      han byder både over Vindene og Vandet, og de ere ham lydige?"

 26.  Og de sejlede ind til Gadarenernes Land, som ligger lige over
      for Galilæa.
 27.  Men da han trådte ud på Landjorden, mødte der ham en Mand fra
      Byen, som i lang Tid havde været besat af onde Ånder og ikke
      havde haft Klæder på og ikke opholdt sig i Hus, men i Gravene.
 28.  Men da han så Jesus, råbte han og faldt ned for ham og sagde med
      høj Røst: "Hvad har jeg med dig at gøre, Jesus, den højeste Guds
      Søn?  jeg beder dig om, at du ikke vil pine mig."
 29.  Thi han bød den urene Ånd at fare ud af Manden; thi i lange
      Tider havde den revet ham med sig, og han blev bunden med Lænker
      og Bøjer og bevogtet, og han sønderrev, hvad man bandt ham med,
      og dreves af den onde Ånd ud i Ørkenerne.
 30.  Men Jesus spurgte ham og sagde: "Hvad er dit Navn?" Men han
      sagde: "Leion"; thi mange onde Ånder vare farne i ham.
 31.  Og de bade ham om at han ikke vilde byde dem at fare ned i
      Afgrunden;
 32.  men der var sammesteds en stor Hjord Svin, som græssede på
      Bjerget; og de bade ham om, at han vilde tilstede dem at fare i
      dem; og han tilstedte dem det.
 33.  Men de onde Ånder fore ud at Manden og fore i Svinene, og
      Hjorden styrtede sig ned over Brinken ud i Søen og druknede.
 34.  Men da Hyrderne så det, som var sket, flyede de og forkyndte det
      i Byen og på Landet.
 35.  Da gik de ud for af se det, som var sket, og de kom til Jesus og
      fandt Manden, af hvem de onde Ånder vare udfarne, siddende ved
      Jesu Fødder, påklædt og ved Samling; og de frygtede.
 36.  Og de, som havde set det, fortalte dem, hvorledes den besatte
      var bleven frelst.
 37.  Og hele Mængden fra Gadarenernes Omegn bad ham om, at han vilde
      gå bort fra dem; thi de vare betagne af stor Frygt. Men han gik
      om Bord i et Skib og vendte tilbage igen.
 38.  Men Manden, af hvem de onde Ånder vare udfarne, bad ham om, at
      han måtte være hos ham; men han lod ham fare og sagde:
 39.  "Vend tilbage til dit Hus, og fortæl, hvor store Ting Gud har
      gjort imod dig." Og han gik bort og kundgjorde over hele Byen,
      hvor store Ting Jesus havde gjort imod ham.

 40.  Men det skete, da Jesus kom tilbage, tog Skaren imod ham; thi de
      ventede alle på ham.
 41.  Og se, det kom en Mand, som hed Jairus, og han var Forstander
      for Synagogen; og han faldt ned for Jesu Fødder og bad ham komme
      ind i hans Hus;
 42.  thi han havde en enbåren Datter, omtrent tolv År gammel, og hun
      droges med Døden. Men idet han gik, trængte Skarerne sig sammen
      om ham.
 43.  Og en Kvinde, som havde haft Blodflod i tolv År og havde kostet
      al sin Formue på Læger og ikke kunde blive helbredt af nogen,
 44.  hun gik til bagfra og rørte ved Fligen af hans Klædebon, og
      straks standsedes hendes Blodflod.
 45.  Og Jesus sagde: "Hvem var det, som rørte ved mig?" Men da alle
      nægtede det, sagde Peter og de, som vare med ham: "Mester!
      Skarerne trykke og trænge dig, og du siger: Hvem var det, som
      rørte ved mig?"
 46.  Men Jesus sagde: "Der rørte nogen ved mig; thi jeg mærkede, at
      der udgik en Kraft fra mig."
 47.  Men da Kvinden så, at det ikke var skjult, kom hun bævende og
      faldt ned for ham og fortalte i alt Folkets Påhør, af hvad Årsag
      hun havde rørt ved ham, og hvorledes hun straks var bleven
      helbredt.
 48.  Men han sagde til hende: "Datter! din Tro har frelst dig; gå
      bort med Fred!"
 49.  Medens han endnu talte, kommer der en fra Synagogeforstanderens
      Hus og siger til ham: "Din Datter er død; umag ikke Mesteren!"
 50.  Men da Jesus hørte det, svarede han ham: "Frygt ikke; tro blot;
      så skal hun blive frelst."
 51.  Men da han kom til Huset, tillod han ingen at gå ind med sig
      uden Peter og Johannes og Jakob og Pigens Fader og Moder.
 52.  Og de græd alle og holdt Veklage over hende; men han sagde:
      "Græder ikke; hun er ikke død, men sover."
 53.  Og de lo ad ham; thi de vidste, at hun var død.
 54.  Men han greb hendes Hånd og råbte og sagde: "Pige, stå op!"
 55.  Og hendes Ånd vendte tilbage, og hun stod straks op; og han
      befalede, at de skulde give hende noget at spise.
 56.  Og hendes Forældre bleve forfærdede; men han bød dem, at de ikke
      måtte sige nogen det, som var sket.

Lukas 9

  1.  Men han sammenkaldte de tolv og gav dem Magt og Myndighed over
      alle de onde Ånder og til at helbrede Sygdomme.
  2.  Og han sendte dem ud for at prædike Guds Rige og helbrede de
      syge.
  3.  Og han sagde til dem: "Tager intet med på Vejen, hverken Stav
      eller Taske eller Brød eller Penge, ej heller skal nogen have to
      Kjortler.
  4.  Og hvor I komme ind i et Hus, der skulle I blive og derfra drage
      bort.
  5.  Og hvor som helst de ikke modtage eder, fra den By skulle I gå
      ud og endog ryste Støvet af eders Fødder til Vidnesbyrd imod
      dem."
  6.  Men de gik ud og droge fra Landsby til Landsby, idet de
      forkyndte Evangeliet og helbredte alle Vegne.

  7.  Men Fjerdingsfyrsten Herodes hørte alt det, som skete; og han
      var tvivlrådig, fordi nogle sagde, at Johannes var oprejst fra
      de døde;
  8.  men nogle, at Elias havde vist sig; men andre, at en af de gamle
      Profeter var opstanden.
  9.  Men Herodes sagde: "Johannes har jeg ladet halshugge; men hvem
      er denne, om hvem jeg hører sådanne Ting?" Og han søgte at få
      ham at se.

 10.  Og Apostlene kom tilbage og fortalte ham, hvor store Ting de
      havde gjort. Og han tog dem med sig og drog bort afsides til en
      By, som kaldes Bethsajda.
 11.  Men da Skarerne fik det at vide, fulgte de efter ham; og han tog
      imod dem og talte til dem om Guds Rige og helbredte dem, som
      trængte til Lægedom.
 12.  Men Dagen begyndte at hælde. Og de tolv kom hen og sagde til
      ham: "Lad Skaren gå bort, for at de kunne gå herfra til de
      omliggende Landsbyer og Gårde og få Herberge og finde Føde; thi
      her ere vi på et øde Sted."
 13.  Men han sagde til dem: "Giver I dem at spise!"Men de sagde: "Vi
      have ikke mere end fem Brød og to Fisk, med mindre vi skulle gå
      bort og købe Mad til hele denne Mængde."
 14.  De vare nemlig omtrent fem Tusinde Mænd. Men han sagde til sine
      Disciple: "Lader dem sætte sig ned i Hobe, halvtredsindstyve i
      hver."
 15.  Og de gjorde så og lode dem alle sætte sig ned.
 16.  Men han tog de fem Brød og de to Fisk, så op til Himmelen og
      velsignede dem, og han brød dem og gav sine Disciple dem at
      lægge dem for Skaren.
 17.  Og de spiste og bleve alle mætte; og det, som de fik tilovers af
      Stykker, blev opsamlet, tolv Kurve.

 18.  Og det skete, medens han bad, vare hans Disciple alene hos ham;
      og han spurgte dem og sagde: "Hvem sige Skarerne, at jeg er?"
 19.  Men de svarede og sagde: "Johannes Døberen; men andre: Elias;
      men andre: En af de gamle Profeter er opstanden."
 20.  Og han sagde til dem: "Men I hvem sige I, at jeg er?" Og Peter
      svarede og sagde: "Guds Kristus."
 21.  Men han bød dem strengt ikke at sige dette til nogen,
 22.  idet han sagde: "Menneskesønnen skal lide meget og forkastes af
      de Ældste og Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge og ihjelslås og
      oprejses på den tredje Dag."

 23.  Men han sagde til alle: "Vil nogen komme efter mig, han fornægte
      sig selv og tage sit Kors op daglig og følge mig;
 24.  thi den, som vil frelse sit Liv. skal miste det; men den, som
      mister sit Liv for min Skyld, han skal frelse det.
 25.  Thi hvad gavner det et Menneske, om han har vundet den hele
      Verden, men mistet sig selv eller bødet med sig selv?
 26.  Thi den, som skammer sig ved mig og mine Ord, ved ham skal
      Menneskesønnen skamme sig, når han kommer i sin og Faderens og
      de hellige Engles Herlighed.
 27.  Men sandelig, siger jeg eder: Der er nogle af dem, som stå her.
      der ingenlunde skulle smage Døden. førend de se Guds Rige."

 28.  Men det skete omtrent otte Dage efter denne Tale, at han tog
      Peter og Johannes og Jakob med sig og gik op på Bjerget for at
      bede.
 29.  Og det skete, medens han bad, da blev hans Ansigts Udseende
      anderledes, og hans Klædebon blev hvidt og strålende.
 30.  Og se, to Mænd talte med ham, og det var Moses og Elias,
 31.  som bleve set i Herlighed og talte om hans Udgang, som han
      skulde fuldbyrde i Jerusalem.
 32.  Men Peter og de, som vare med ham, vare betyngede af Søvn; men
      da de vågnede op, så de hans Herlighed og de to Mænd, som stode
      hos ham.
 33.  Og det skete, da disse skiltes fra ham, sagde Peter til Jesus:
      "Mester! det er godt, at vi ere her; og lader os gøre tre
      Hytter, en til dig og en til Moses og en til Elias;" men han
      vidste ikke, hvad han sagde.
 34.  Men idet han sagde dette, kom en Sky og overskyggede dem; men de
      frygtede, da de kom ind i Skyen.
 35.  Og der kom fra Skyen en Røst, som sagde: "Denne er min Søn, den
      udvalgte, hører ham!"
 36.  Og da Røsten kom, blev Jesus funden alene. Og de tav og
      forkyndte i de Dage ingen noget af det, de havde set.

 37.  Men det skete Dagen derefter, da de kom ned fra Bjerget, at der
      mødte ham en stor Skare.
 38.  Og se, en Mand af Skaren råbte og sagde: "Mester! jeg beder dig,
      se til min Søn: thi han er min enbårne.
 39.  Og se, en Ånd griber ham, og pludseligt skriger han, og den
      slider i ham, så at han fråder, og med Nød viger den fra ham,
      idet den mishandler ham;
 40.  og jeg bad dine Disciple om at uddrive den; og de kunde ikke."
 41.  Men Jesus svarede og sagde: "O du vantro og forvendte Slægt!
      hvor længe skal jeg være hos eder og tåle eder? Bring din Søn
      hid!"
 42.  Men endnu medens han gik derhen, rev og sled den onde Ånd i ham.
      Men Jesus truede den urene Ånd og helbredte drengen og gav hans
      Fader ham tilbage.
 43.  Men de bleve alle slagne af Forundring over Guds Majestæt. Men
      da alle undrede sig over alt det, han gjorde, sagde han til sine
      Disciple:

 44.  "Gemmer i eders Øren disse Ord: Menneskesønnen skal overgives i
      Menneskers Hænder."
 45.  Men de forstode ikke dette Ord, og det var skjult for dem, så de
      ikke begreb det, og de frygtede for at spørge ham om dette Ord.

 46.  Men der opstod den Tanke hos dem, hvem der vel var den største
      af dem.
 47.  Men da Jesus så deres Hjertes Tanke, tog, han et Barn og
      stillede det hos sig.
 48.  Og han sagde til dem: "Den, som modtager dette Barn for mit
      Navns Skyld, modtager mig; og den, som modtager mig, modtager
      den, som udsendte mig; thi den, som er den mindste iblandt eder
      alle, han er stor."

 49.  Men Johannes tog til Orde og sagde: "Mester! vi så en uddrive
      onde Ånder i dit Navn; og vi forbød ham det, fordi han ikke
      følger med os."
 50.  Men Jesus sagde til ham: "Forbyder ham det ikke; thi den, som
      ikke er imod eder, er for eder."

 51.  Men det skete, da hans Optagelses Dage vare ved at fuldkommes,
      da fæstede han sit Ansigt på at drage til Jerusalem.
 52.  Og han sendte Sendebud forud for sig; og de gik og kom ind i en
      Samaritanerlandsby for at berede ham Herberge.
 53.  Og de modtoge ham ikke, fordi han var på Vejen til Jerusalem.
 54.  Men da hans Disciple, Jakob og Johannes, så det, sagde de:
      "Herre!  vil du, at vi skulle byde Ild fare ned fra Himmelen og
      fortære dem, ligesom også Elias gjorde?"
 55.  Men han vendte sig og irettesatte dem.
 56.  Og de gik til en anden Landsby.

 57.  Og medens de vandrede på Vejen, sagde en til ham: "Jeg vil følge
      dig, hvor du end går hen."
 58.  Og Jesus sagde til ham: "Ræve have Huler, og Himmelens Fugle
      Reder; men Menneskesønnen har ikke det, hvortil han kan hælde
      sit Hoved."
 59.  Men han sagde til en anden: "Følg mig!" Men denne sagde: "Herre!
      tilsted mig først at gå hen at begrave min Fader."
 60.  Men han sagde til ham: "Lad de døde begrave deres døde; men gå
      du hen og forkynd Guds Rige!"
 61.  Men også en anden sagde: "Herre! jeg vil følge dig; men tilsted
      mig først at tage Afsked med dem, som ere i mit Hus."
 62.  Men Jesus sagde til ham: "Ingen, som lægger sin Hånd på Ploven
      og ser tilbage, er vel skikket for Guds Rige."

Lukas 10

  1.  Men derefter udvalgte Herren også halvfjerdsindstyve andre og
      sendte dem ud to og to forud for sig, til hver By og hvert Sted,
      hvorhen han selv vilde komme.
  2.  Og han sagde til dem: "Høsten er stor, men Arbejderne ere få;
      beder derfor Høstens Herre om, at han vil sende Arbejdere ud til
      sin Høst.
  3.  Går ud! Se, jeg sender eder som Lam midt iblandt Ulve.
  4.  Bærer ikke Pung, ikke Taske, ej heller Sko; og hilser ingen på
      Vejen!
  5.  Men hvor I komme ind i et Hus, siger der først: Fred være med
      dette Hus!
  6.  Og er der sammesteds et Fredens Barn, skal eders Fred Hvile på
      ham; men hvis ikke, da skal den vende tilbage til eder igen.
  7.  Men bliver i det samme Hus, spiser og drikker, hvad de have; thi
      Arbejderen er sin Løn værd. I må ikke flytte fra Hus til Hus
  8.  Og hvor I komme ind i en By. og de modtage eder, spiser der,
      hvad der sættes for eder;
  9.  og Helbreder de syge, som ere der, og siger dem: Guds Rige er
      kommet nær til eder.
 10.  Men hvor I komme ind i en By og de ikke modtage eder, der skulle
      I gå ud på dens Gader og sige:
 11.  Endog det Støv, som hænger ved vore Fødder fra eders By, tørre
      vi af til eder; dog dette skulle I vide, at Guds Rige er kommet
      nær.
 12.  Men jeg siger eder, det skal gå Sodoma tåleligere på hin Dag end
      den By.
 13.  Ve dig, Korazin! ve dig, Bethsajda! thi dersom de kraftige
      Gerninger, som ere skete i eder, vare skete i Tyrus og Sidon, da
      havde de for længe siden omvendt sig, siddende i Sæk og Aske.
 14.  Men det skal gå Tyrus og Sidon tåleligere ved Dommen end eder.
 15.  Og du, Kapernaum, som er bleven ophøjet indtil Himmelen, du skal
      nedstødes indtil Dødsriget.
 16.  Den, som hører eder, hører mig, og den, som foragter eder,
      foragter mig; men den, som foragter mig, foragter den, som
      udsendte mig."

 17.  Men de halvfjerdsindsfyve vendte tilbage med Glæde og sagde:
      "Herre! også de onde Ånder ere os lydige i dit Navn."
 18.  Men han sagde til dem: "Jeg så Satan falde ned fra Himmelen som
      et Lyn.
 19.  Se, jeg har givet eder Myndighed til at træde på Slanger og
      Skorpioner og over hele Fjendens Magt, og slet intet skal skade
      eder.
 20.  Dog, glæder eder ikke derover, at Ånderne ere eder lydige; men
      glæder eder over, at eders Navne ere indskrevne i Himlene."

 21.  I den samme Stund frydede Jesus sig i den Helligånd og sagde:
      "Jeg priser dig, Fader, Himmelens og Jordens Herre! fordi du har
      skjult dette for vise og forstandige og åbenbaret det for
      umyndige. Ja, Fader! thi således skete det, som var
      velbehageligt for dig.
 22.  Alle Ting ere mig overgivne af min Fader; og ingen kender, hvem
      Sønnen er, uden Faderen, og hvem Faderen er, uden Sønnen og den,
      for hvem Sønnen vil åbenbare ham."
 23.  Og han vendte sig til Disciplene og sagde særligt til dem:
      "Salige ere de Øjne, som se det, I se.
 24.  Thi jeg siger eder, at mange Profeter og Konger have ville se
      det, I se, og have ikke set det, og høre det, I høre, og have
      ikke hørt det."

 25.  Og se, en lovkyndig stod op og fristede ham og sagde: "Mester!
      hvad skal jeg gøre, for at jeg kan arve et evigt Liv?"
 26.  Men han sagde til ham: "Hvad er der skrevet i Loven, hvorledes
      læser du?".
 27.  Men han svarede og sagde til ham: "Du skal elske Herren din Gud
      af hele dit Hjerte og med hele din Sjæl og med hele din Styrke
      og med hele dit Sind, og din Næste som dig selv."
 28.  Men han sagde til ham: "Du svarede ret; gør dette, så skal du
      leve."
 29.  Men han vilde gøre sig selv retfærdig og sagde til Jesus: "Hvem
      er da min Næste?"
 30.  Men Jesus svarede og sagde: "Et Menneske gik ned fra Jerusalem
      til Jeriko, og han faldt iblandt Røvere, som både klædte ham af
      og sloge ham og gik bort og lod ham ligge halvdød.
 31.  Men ved en Hændelse gik en Præst den samme Vej ned, og da han så
      ham, gik han forbi.
 32.  Ligeså også en Levit; da han kom til Stedet, gik han hen og så
      ham og gik forbi.
 33.  Men en Samaritan, som var på Rejse, kom til ham, og da han så
      ham, ynkedes han inderligt.
 34.  Og han gik hen til ham, forbandt hans Sår og gød Olie og Vin
      deri, løftede ham op på sit eget Dyr og førte ham til et
      Herberge og plejede ham.
 35.  Og den næste Dag tog han to Denarer frem og gav Værten dem og
      sagde: Plej ham! og hvad mere du lægger ud, vil jeg betale dig,
      når jeg kommer igen.
 36.  Hvilken af disse tre tykkes dig nu at have været hans Næste, der
      var falden iblandt Røverne?"
 37.  Men han sagde: "Han, som øvede.Barmhjertighed imod ham." Og
      Jesus sagde til ham: "Gå bort, og gør du ligeså!"

 38.  Men det skete, medens de vare på Vandring, gik han ind i en
      Landsby; og en Kvinde ved Navn Martha modtog ham i sit Hus.
 39.  Og hun havde en Søster, som hed Maria, og hun satte sig ved
      Herrens Fødder og hørte på hans Tale.
 40.  Men Martha havde travlt med megen Opvartning; og hun kom hen og
      sagde: "Herre! bryder du dig ikke om, at min Søster har ladet
      mig opvarte ene? Sig hende dog, at hun skal hjælpe mig."
 41.  Men Herren svarede og sagde til hende: "Martha! Martha! du gør
      dig Bekymring og Uro med mange Ting;
 42.  men eet er fornødent. Maria har valgt den gode Del, som ikke
      skal tages fra hende."

Lukas 11

  1.  Og det skete, da han var på et Sted og bad, at en af hans
      Disciple sagde til ham, da han holdt op: "Herre! lær os at bede,
      som også Johannes lærte sine Disciple."
  2.  Da sagde han til dem: "Når I bede, da siger: Fader, Helliget
      vorde dit Navn; komme dit Rige;
  3.  giv os hver dag vort daglige Brød;
  4.  og forlad os vore Synder, thi også vi forlade hver, som er os
      skyldig; og led os ikke i Fristelse!"
  5.  Og han sagde til dem: "Om nogen af eder har en Ven og går til
      ham ved Midnat og siger til ham: Kære! lån mig tre Brød,
  6.  efterdi en Ven af mig er kommen til mig fra Rejsen, og jeg har
      intet at sætte for ham;
  7.  og hin så svarer derinde fra og siger: Vold mig ikke Besvær;
      Døren er allerede lukket, og mine Børn ere med mig i Seng; jeg
      kan ikke stå op og give dig det:
  8.  da, siger jeg eder, om han end ikke står op og giver ham det,
      fordi han er hans Ven, så står han dog op for hans Påtrængenheds
      Skyld og giver ham alt, hvad han trænger til.
  9.  Og jeg siger eder: Beder, så skal eder gives; søger, så skulle I
      finde; banker på, så skal der lukkes op for eder.
 10.  Thi hver den, som beder, han får, og den, som søger, han finder,
      og den, som banker på, for ham skal der lukkes op.
 11.  Men hvilken Fader iblandt eder vil give sin Søn en Sten, når han
      beder om Brød, eller når han beder om en Fisk, mon han da i
      Stedet for en Fisk vil give ham en Slange?
 12.  Eller når han beder om et Æg, mon han da vil give ham en
      Skorpion?
 13.  Dersom da I, som ere onde, vide at give eders Børn gode Gaver,
      hvor meget mere skal da Faderen fra Himmelen give den Helligånd
      til dem, som bede ham!"

 14.  Og han uddrev en ond Ånd, og den var stum; men det skete, da den
      onde Ånd var udfaren, talte den stumme, og Skaren forundrede
      sig.
 15.  Men nogle af dem sagde: "Ved Beelzebul, de onde Ånders Fyrste,
      uddriver han de onde Ånder."
 16.  Men andre fristede ham og forlangte af ham et Tegn fra
      Himmelen..
 17.  Men da han kendte deres Tanker, sagde han til dem: "Hvert Rige,
      som er kommet i Splid med sig selv, lægges øde, og Hus falder
      over Hus.
 18.  Men hvis også Satan er kommen i Splid med sig selv, hvorledes
      skal hans Rige da bestå? Thi l sige, at jeg uddriver de onde
      Ånder ved Beelzebul.
 19.  Men dersom jeg uddriver de onde Ånder ved Beelzebul, ved hvem
      uddrive da eders Sønner dem? Derfor skulle de være eders
      Dommere.
 20.  Men dersom jeg uddriver de onde Ånder ved Guds Finger, da er jo
      Guds Rige kommet til eder.
 21.  Når den stærke bevæbnet vogter sin Gård, bliver det, han ejer, i
      Fred.
 22.  Men når en stærkere end han er kommen over ham og har overvundet
      ham, da tager han hans fulde Rustning, som han forlod sig på, og
      uddeler hans Bytte.
 23.  Den, som ikke er med mig, er imod mig; og den, som ikke samler
      med mig, adspreder.
 24.  Når den urene Ånd er faren ud af Mennesket, vandrer den igennem
      vandløse Steder og søger Hvile; og når den ikke finder den,
      siger den: Jeg vil vende tilbage til mit Hus, som jeg gik ud af.
 25.  Og når den kommer, finder den det fejet og prydet.
 26.  Da går den bort og tager syv andre Ånder med sig, som ere værre
      end den selv, og når de ere komne derind, bo de der; og det
      sidste bliver værre med dette Menneske end det første."

 27.  Men det skete, medens han sagde disse Ting, da opløftede en
      Kvinde af Skaren sin Røst og sagde til ham: "Saligt er det Liv,
      som bar dig, og de Bryster, som du diede."
 28.  Men han sagde: "Ja, salige ere de, som høre Guds Ord og bevare
      det."

 29.  Men da Skarerne strømmede til, begyndte han at sige: "Denne
      Slægt er en ond Slægt; et Tegn forlanger den, og der skal intet
      Tegn gives den uden Jonas's Tegn.
 30.  Thi ligesom Jonas blev et Tegn for Niniviterne, således skal
      også Menneskesønnen være det for denne Slægt.
 31.  Sydens Dronning skal oprejses ved Dommen sammen med Mændene af
      denne Slægt og fordømme dem; thi hun kom fra Jordens Grænser for
      at høre Salomons Visdom; og se, her er mere end Salomon.
 32.  Mænd fra Ninive skulle opstå ved Dommen sammen med denne Slægt
      og fordømme den; thi de omvendte sig ved Jonas's Prædiken; og
      se, her er mere end Jonas.

 33.  Ingen tænder et Lys og sætter det i Skjul, ikke heller under
      Skæppen, men på Lysestagen, for at de, som komme ind, kunne se
      dets Skin.
 34.  Dit Øje er Legemets Lys; når dit Øje er sundt, er også hele dit
      Legeme lyst, men dersom det er dårligt, er også dit Legeme
      mørkt.
 35.  Se derfor til, at det Lys, der er i dig, ikke er Mørke.
 36.  Dersom da hele dit Legeme et lyst, så at ingen Del deraf er
      mørk, vil det være helt lyst, som når Lyset bestråler dig med
      sin Glans."

 37.  Men idet han talte, beder en Farisæer ham om, at han vilde spise
      Middagsmåltid hos ham, og han gik ind og satte sig til Bords.
 38.  Men Farisæeren forundrede sig, da han så, at han ikke toede sig
      først før Måltidet.
 39.  Men Herren sagde til ham: "I Farisæere rense nu det udvendige af
      Bægeret og Fadet; men eders Indre er fuldt af Rov og Ondskab.
 40.  I Dårer! han, som gjorde det ydre, gjorde han ikke også det
      indre?
 41.  Men giver det, som er indeni, til Almisse; se, så ere alle Ting
      eder rene.
 42.  Men ve eder, I Farisæere! thi I give Tiende af Mynte og Rude og
      alle Hånde Urter og forbigå Retten og Kærligheden til Gud; disse
      Ting burde man gøre og ikke forsømme hine.
 43.  Ve eder, I Farisæere! thi I elske den fornemste Plads i
      Synagogerne og Hilsenerne på Torvene.
 44.  Ve eder, thi I ere som de ukendelige Grave, og Menneskene, som
      gå over dem, vide det ikke."
 45.  Men en af de lovkyndige svarede og siger til ham: "Mester! idet
      du siger dette, forhåner du også os,"
 46.  Men han sagde: "Ve også eder, I lovkyndige! thi I lægge
      Menneskene Byrder på, vanskelige at bære, og selv røre I ikke
      Byrderne med een af eders Fingre.
 47.  Ve eder! thi I bygge Profeternes Grave, og eders Fædre sloge dem
      ihjel.
 48.  Altså ere I Vidner og samtykke i eders Fædres Gerninger; thi de
      sloge dem ihjel, og I bygge.
 49.  Derfor har også Guds Visdom sagt: Jeg vil sende Profeter og
      Apostle til dem, og nogle af dem skulle de slå ihjel og
      forfølge,
 50.  for at alle Profeternes Blod, som er udøst fra Verdens
      Grundlæggelse, skal kræves af denne Slægt,
 51.  fra Abels Blod indtil Sakarias's Blod, som blev dræbt imellem
      Alteret og Templet; ja, jeg siger eder: Det skal kræves af denne
      Slægt.
 52.  Ve eder, I lovkyndige! thi I have taget Kundskabens Nøgle; selv
      ere I ikke gåede ind, og dem, som vilde gå ind, have I
      forhindret."
 53.  Og da han var gået ud derfra, begyndte de skriftkloge og
      Farisæerne at trænge stærkt ind på ham og at lokke Ord af hans
      Mund om flere Ting;
 54.  thi de lurede på ham for at opfange noget af hans Mund, for at
      de kunde anklage ham.

Lukas 12

  1.  Da imidlertid mange Tusinde Mennesker havde samlet sig, så at de
      trådte på hverandre, begyndte han at sige til sine Disciple:
      "Tager eder først og fremmest i Vare for Farisæernes Surdejg,
      som er Hykleri.
  2.  Men intet er skjult, som jo skal åbenbares, og intet er lønligt,
      som jo skal blive kendt.
  3.  Derfor, alt hvad I have sagt i Mørket, skal høres i Lyset; og
      hvad I have talt i Øret i Kamrene, skal blive prædiket på
      Tagene.

  4.  Men jeg siger til eder, mine Venner! frygter ikke for dem, som
      slå Legemet ihjel og derefter ikke formå at gøre mere.
  5.  Men jeg vil vise eder, for hvem I skulle frygte: Frygter for
      ham, som har Magt til, efter at have slået ihjel, at kaste i
      Helvede; ja, jeg siger eder: Frygter for ham!
  6.  Sælges ikke fem Spurve for to Penninge? og ikke een af dem er
      glemt hos Gud.
  7.  Ja, endog Hårene på eders Hoved ere alle talte; frygter ikke, I
      ere mere værd end mange Spurve.
  8.  Men jeg siger eder: Enhver, som vedkender sig mig for
      Menneskene, ham vil også Menneskesønnen vedkende sig for Guds
      Engle.
  9.  Og den, som har fornægtet mig for Menneskene, skal fornægtes for
      Guds Engle.
 10.  Og enhver, som taler et Ord imod Menneskesønnen, ham skal det
      forlades; men den, som har talt bespotteligt imod den Helligånd,
      ham skal det ikke forlades.
 11.  Men når de føre eder frem for Synagogerne og Øvrighederne og
      Myndighederne, da bekymrer eder ikke for, hvorledes eller
      hvormed I skulle forsvare eder, eller hvad I skulle sige.
 12.  Thi den Helligånd skal lære eder i den samme Time, hvad I bør
      sige."

 13.  Men en af Skaren sagde til ham: "Mester! sig til min Broder, at
      han skal dele Arven med mig."
 14.  Men han sagde til ham: "Menneske! hvem har sat mig til Dommer
      eller Deler over eder?"
 15.  Og han sagde til dem: "Ser til og vogter eder for al Havesyge;
      thi ingens Liv beror på, hvad han ejer, selv om han har
      Overflod."
 16.  Og han sagde en Lignelse til dem: "Der var en rig Mand, hvis
      Mark havde båret godt.
 17.  Og han tænkte ved sig selv og sagde: Hvad skal jeg gøre? thi jeg
      har ikke Rum, hvori jeg kan samle min Afgrøde.
 18.  Og han sagde: Dette vil jeg gøre, jeg vil nedbryde mine Lader og
      bygge dem større, og jeg vil samle deri al min Afgrøde og mit
      Gods;
 19.  og jeg vil sige til min Sjæl: Sjæl! du har mange gode Ting
      liggende for mange År; slå dig til Ro, spis, drik, vær lystig!
 20.  Men Gud sagde til ham: Du Dåre! i denne Nat kræves din Sjæl af
      dig; men hvem skal det høre til. som du har beredt?
 21.  Således er det med den, som samler sig Skatte og ikke er rig i
      Gud."

 22.  Men han sagde til sine Disciple: "Derfor siger jeg eder:
      Bekymrer eder ikke for Livet, hvad I skulle spise; ikke heller
      for Legemet, hvad I skulle iføre eder.
 23.  Livet er mere end Maden, og Legemet mere end Klæderne.
 24.  Giver Agt på Ravnene, at de hverken så eller høste og de have
      ikke Forrådskammer eller Lade, og Gud føder dem; hvor langt mere
      værd end Fuglene ere dog I?
 25.  Og hvem af eder kan ved at bekymre sig lægge en Alen til sin
      Vækst?
 26.  Formå I altså ikke engang det mindste, hvorfor bekymre I eder da
      for det øvrige?
 27.  Giver Agt på Lillierne, hvorledes de vokse; de arbejde ikke og
      spinde ikke; men jeg siger eder: End ikke Salomon i al sin
      Herlighed var klædt som en af dem.
 28.  Klæder da Gud således det Græs på Marken, som i Dag står og i
      Morgen kastes i Ovnen, hvor meget mere eder, I lidettroende!
 29.  Og I, spørger ikke efter, hvad I skulle spise, og hvad I skulle
      drikke; og værer ikke ængstelige!
 30.  Thi efter alt dette søge Hedningerne i Verden; men eders Fader
      ved, at I have disse Ting nødig.
 31.  Men søger hans Rige, så skulle disse Ting gives eder i Tilgift.
 32.  Frygt ikke, du lille Hjord! thi det var eders Fader
      velbehageligt at give eder Riget.
 33.  Sælger, hvad I eje, og giver Almisse! Gører eder Punge, som ikke
      ældes, en Skat i Himlene, som ikke slipper op, der hvor ingen
      Tyv kommer nær, og intet Møl ødelægger.
 34.  Thi hvor eders Skat er, der vil også eders Hjerte være.

 35.  Eders Lænder være omgjordede, og eders Lys brændende!
 36.  Og værer I ligesom Mennesker, der vente på deres Herre, når han
      vil bryde op fra Brylluppet, for at de straks, når han kommer og
      banker på, kunne lukke op for ham.
 37.  Salige ere de Tjenere, som Herren finder vågne, når han kommer.
      Sandelig, siger jeg eder, at han skal binde op om sig og sætte
      dem til Bords og gå om og varte dem op,
 38.  Og dersom han kommer i den anden Nattevagt og kommer i den
      tredje Nattevagt og finder det således, da ere disse Tjenere
      salige.
 39.  Men dette skulle I vide, at dersom Husbonden vidste, i hvilken
      Time Tyven vilde komme, da vågede han og tillod ikke, at der
      skete Indbrud i hans Hus.
 40.  Vorder også I rede; thi Menneskesønnen kommer i den Time, som I
      ikke mene."
 41.  Men Peter sagde til ham: "Herre! siger du denne Lignelse til os
      eller også til alle?"
 42.  Og Herren sagde: "Hvem er vel den tro og forstandige Husholder,
      som Herren vil sætte over sit Tyende til at give dem den
      bestemte Kost i rette Tid?
 43.  Salig er den Tjener, hvem hans Herre, når han kommer, finder
      handlende således.
 44.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, han skal sætte ham over alt, hvad han
      ejer.
 45.  Men dersom hin Tjener siger i sit Hjerte: "Min Herre tøver med
      at komme" og så begynder at slå Karlene og Pigerne og at spise
      og drikke og beruse sig,
 46.  da skal den Tjeners Herre komme på den Dag, han ikke venter, og
      i den Time, han ikke ved, og hugge ham sønder og give ham hans
      Lod sammen med de utro:
 47.  Men den Tjener, som har kendt sin Herres Villie og ikke har
      truffet Forberedelser eller handlet efter hans Villie, skal have
      mange Hug;
 48.  men den, som ikke har kendt den og har gjort, hvad der er Hug
      værd, skal have få Hug. Enhver, hvem meget er givet, af ham skal
      man kræve meget; og hvem meget er betroet, af ham skal man
      forlange mere.

 49.  Ild er jeg kommen at kaste på Jorden, og hvor vilde jeg, at den
      var optændt allerede!
 50.  Men en Dåb har jeg at døbes med, og hvor ængstes jeg, indtil den
      er fuldbyrdet!
 51.  Mene I, at jeg er kommen for at give Fred på Jorden? Nej, siger
      jeg eder, men Splid,
 52.  Thi fra nu af skulle fem i eet Hus være i Splid indbyrdes, tre
      imod to, og to imod tre.
 53.  De skulle være i Splid, Fader med Søn og Søn med Fader, Moder
      med Datter og Datter med Moder, Svigermoder med sin Svigerdatter
      og Svigerdatter med sin Svigermoder."

 54.  Men han sagde også til Skarerne: "Når I se en Sky komme op i
      Vester, sige I straks: Der kommer Regn, og det sker således.
 55.  Og når I se en Søndenvind blæse, sige I: Der kommer Hede: og det
      sker.
 56.  I Hyklere! Jordens og Himmelens Udseende vide I at skønne om;
      men hvorfor have I da intet Skøn om den nærværende Tid?
 57.  Og hvorfor dømme I ikke også fra eder selv, hvad der er det
      rette?
 58.  Thi medens du går hen med din Modpart til Øvrigheden, da gør dig
      Flid på Vejen for at blive forligt med ham, for at han ikke skal
      trække dig for Dommeren, og Dommeren skal overgive dig til
      Slutteren, og Slutteren skal kaste dig i Fængsel.
 59.  Jeg siger dig: Du skal ingenlunde komme ud derfra, førend du får
      betalt endog den sidste Skærv."

Lukas 13

  1.  Men på den samme Tid var der nogle til Stede, som fortalte ham
      om de Galilæere, hvis Blod Pilatus havde blandet med deres Ofre.
  2.  Og han svarede og sagde til dem: "Mene I, at disse Galilæere
      vare Syndere frem for alle Galilæere, fordi de have lidt dette?
  3.  Nej, siger jeg eder; men dersom I ikke omvende eder, skulle I
      alle omkomme ligeså.
  4.  Eller hine atten, som Tårnet i Siloam faldt ned over og
      ihjelslog, mene I, at de vare skyldige fremfor alle Mennesker,
      som bo i Jerusalem?
  5.  Nej, siger jeg eder; men dersom I ikke omvende eder, skulle I
      alle omkomme ligeså."

  6.  Men han sagde denne Lignelse: "En havde et Figentræ, som var
      plantet i hans Vingård; og han kom og ledte efter Frugt derpå og
      fandt ingen.
  7.  Men han sagde til Vingårdsmanden: Se, i tre År er jeg nu kommen
      og har ledt efter Frugt på dette Figentræ og ingen fundet; hug
      det om; hvorfor skal det tilmed gøre Jorden unyttig?
  8.  Men han svarede og sagde til ham: Herre! lad det stå endnu dette
      År, indtil jeg får gravet om det og gødet det;
  9.  måske vil det bære Frugt i Fremtiden; men hvis ikke, da hug det
      om!"

 10.  Men han lærte i en af Synagogerne på Sabbaten.
 11.  Og se, der var en Kvinde, som havde haft en Svagheds Ånd i atten
      År, og hun var sammenbøjet og kunde aldeles ikke rette sig op.
 12.  Men da Jesus så hende, kaldte han på hende og sagde til hende:
      "Kvinde! du er løst fra din Svaghed."
 13.  Og han lagde Hænderne på hende; og straks rettede hun sig op og
      priste Gud.
 14.  Men Synagogeforstanderen, som var vred, fordi Jesus helbredte på
      Sabbaten, tog til Orde og sagde til Folkeskaren: "Der er seks
      Dage, på hvilke man bør arbejde; kommer derfor på dem og lader
      eder helbrede, og ikke på Sabbatsdagen!"
 15.  Men Herren svarede ham og sagde: "I Hyklere! løser ikke enhver
      iblandt eder sin Okse eller sit Asen fra Krybben på Sabbaten og
      fører dem til Vands?
 16.  Men denne, som er en Abrahams Datter, hvem Satan har bundet, se,
      i atten År, burde hun ikke løses fra dette Bånd på
      Sabbatsdagen?"
 17.  Og da han sagde dette, bleve alle hans Modstandere beskæmmede;
      og hele Skaren glædede sig over alle de herlige Gerninger, som
      gjordes af ham.

 18.  Han sagde da: "Hvad ligner Guds Rige, og hvormed skal jeg ligne
      det?
 19.  Det ligner et Sennepskorn, som et Menneske tog og lagde i sin
      Have; og det voksede og blev til et Træ, og Himmelens Fugle
      byggede Rede i dets Grene."
 20.  Og atter sagde han: "Hvormed skal jeg ligne Guds Rige?
 21.  Det ligner en Surdejg, som en Kvinde tog og lagde ned i tre Mål
      Mel, indtil det blev syret alt sammen."

 22.  Og han gik igennem Byer og Landsbyer og lærte og tog Vejen til
      Jerusalem.
 23.  Men en sagde til ham: "Herre mon de ere få, som blive frelste?"
      Da sagde han til dem:
 24.  "Kæmper for at komme ind igennem den snævre Port; thi mange,
      siger jeg eder, skulle søge at komme ind og ikke formå det.
 25.  Fra den Stund Husbonden er stået op og har lukket Døren, og I
      begynde at stå udenfor og banke på Døren og sige: Herre, luk op
      for os! da vil han svare og sige til eder: Jeg kender eder ikke,
      hvorfra I ere;
 26.  da skulle I begynde at sige: vi spiste og drak for dine Øjne, og
      du lærte på vore Gader,
 27.  og han skal sige: Jeg siger eder, jeg kender eder ikke, hvorfra
      I ere; viger bort fra mig, alle I, som øve Uret!
 28.  Der skal der være Gråd og Tænders Gnidsel, når I må se Abraham
      og Isak og Jakob og alle Profeterne i Guds Rige, men eder selv
      blive kastede udenfor.
 29.  Og de skulle komme fra Øster og Vester og fra Norden og Sønden
      og sidde til Bords i Guds Rige.
 30.  Og se, der er sidste, som skulle være iblandt de første, og der
      er første, som skulle være iblandt de sidste."

 31.  I den samme Stund kom nogle Farisæere og sagde til ham: "Gå
      bort, og drag herfra; thi Herodes vil slå dig ihjel."
 32.  Og han sagde til dem: "Går hen og siger til denne Ræv: Se, jeg
      uddriver onde Ånder og fuldfører Helbredelser i Dag og i Morgen,
      og på den tredje dag fuldendes jeg.
 33.  Dog bør jeg vandre i Dag og i Morgen og den Dag derefter; thi
      det sømmer sig ikke, at en Profet dræbes uden for Jerusalem.
 34.  Jerusalem! Jerusalem! som ihjelslår Profeterne og stener dem,
      som ere sendte til dig! hvor ofte vilde jeg samle dine Børn,
      ligesom en Høne samler sine Kyllinger under Vingerne! Og I vilde
      ikke.
 35.  Se, eders Hus overlades til eder selv. Men jeg siger eder: I
      skulle ingenlunde se mig, førend den Tid kommer, da I sige:
      Velsigtnet være den, som kommer, i Herrens Navn!"

Lukas 14

  1.  Og det skete, da han kom ind i en af de øverste Farisæeres Hus
      på en Sabbat for at holde Måltid, at de toge Vare på ham.
  2.  Og se, der stod en vattersottig Mand foran ham.
  3.  Og Jesus tog til Orde og sagde til de lovkyndige og Farisæerne:
      "Er det tilladt at helbrede på Sabbaten eller ej?"
  4.  Men de tav. Og han tog på ham og helbredte ham og lod ham fare.
  5.  Og han tog til Orde og sagde til dem: "Hvem er der iblandt eder,
      som ikke straks, når hans Søn eller Okse falder i en Brønd,
      drager dem op på Sabbatsdagen?"
  6.  Og de kunde ikke give Svar derpå.

  7.  Men han sagde en Lignelse til de budne, da han gav Agt på,
      hvorledes de udvalgte sig de øverste Pladser ved Bordet, og
      sagde til dem:
  8.  "Når du bliver buden af nogen til Bryllup, da sæt dig ikke
      øverst til Bords, for at ikke en fornemmere end du måtte være
      buden af ham,
  9.  og han, som indbød dig og ham, måtte komme og sige til dig: Giv
      denne Plads, og du da med Skam komme til at sidde nederst.
 10.  Men når du bliver buden, da gå hen og sæt dig nederst, for at,
      når han kommer, som har indbudt dig, han da må sige til dig:
      Ven!  sæt dig højere op; da skal du have Ære for alle dem, som
      sidde til Bords med dig.
 11.  Thi enhver, som Ophøjer sig selv, skal fornedres; og den, som
      fornedrer sig selv, skal ophøjes."
 12.  Men han sagde også til ham, som havde indbudt ham: "Når du gør
      Middags- eller Aftensmåltid, da byd ikke dine Venner, ej heller
      dine Brødre, ej heller dine Frænder, ej heller rige Naboer, for
      at ikke også de skulle indbyde dig igen, og du få Vederlag.
 13.  Men når du gør et Gæstebud, da indbyd fattige, vanføre, lamme,
      blinde!
 14.  Så skal du være salig; thi de have intet at gengælde dig med;
      men det skal gengældes dig i de retfærdiges Opstandelse."

 15.  Men da en af dem, som sade med til Bords, hørte dette, sagde han
      til ham: "Salig er den, som holder Måltid i Guds Rige."
 16.  Men han sagde til ham: "der var en Mand, som gjorde en stor
      Nadver og indbød mange.
 17.  Og han udsendte sin Tjener på Nadverens Time for at sige til de
      budne: Kommer! thi nu er det beredt.
 18.  Og de begyndte alle som een at undskylde sig. Den første sagde
      til ham: Jeg har købt en Mark og har nødig at gå ud og se den;
      jeg beder dig, hav mig undskyldt!
 19.  Og en anden sagde: Jeg har købt fem Par Okser og går hen at
      prøve dem; jeg beder dig, hav mig undskyldt!
 20.  Og en anden sagde: Jeg har taget mig en Hustru til Ægte, og
      derfor kan jeg ikke komme.
 21.  Og Tjeneren kom og meldte sin Herre dette; da blev Husbonden
      vred og sagde til sin Tjener: Gå hurtig ud på Byens Stræder og
      Gader, og før de fattige og vanføre og lamme og blinde herind!
 22.  Og Tjeneren sagde: Herre! det er sket, som du befalede, og der
      er endnu Rum.
 23.  Og Herre sagde til Tjeneren: Gå ud på Vejene og ved Gærderne og
      nød dem til at gå ind, for at mit Hus kan blive fuldt.
 24.  Thi jeg siger eder, at ingen af hine Mænd, som vare budne, skal
      smage min Nadver."

 25.  Men store Skarer gik med ham, og han vendte sig og sagde til
      dem:
 26.  "Dersom nogen kommer til mig og ikke hader sin Fader og Moder og
      Hustru og Børn og Brødre og Søstre, ja endog sit eget Liv, kan
      han ikke være min Discipel.
 27.  Den, som ikke bærer sit Kors og følger efter mig, kan ikke være
      min Discipel.
 28.  Thi hvem iblandt eder, som vil bygge et Tårn, sætter sig ikke
      først hen og beregner Omkostningen, om han har nok til at
      fuldføre det,
 29.  for at ikke, når han får lagt Grunden og ej kan fuldende det,
      alle, som se det, skulle begynde at spotte ham og sige:
 30.  Dette Menneske begyndte at bygge og kunde ikke fuldende det.
 31.  Eller hvilken Konge, som drager ud for at gå i Kamp imod en
      anden Konge, sætter sig ikke først hen og rådslår, om han er
      mægtig til med ti Tusinde at møde den, som kommer imod ham med
      tyve Tusinde?
 32.  Men hvis ikke, sender han, medens den anden endnu er langt
      borte, Sendebud hen og underhandler om Fred.
 33.  Således kan da ingen af eder, som ikke forsager alt det, han
      ejer, være min Discipel.
 34.  Saltet er altså godt; men dersom også Saltet mister sin Kraft,
      hvorved skal det da få den igen?
 35.  Det er ikke tjenligt hverken til Jord eller til Gødning; man
      kaster det ud. Den, som har Øren at høre med, han høre!"

Lukas 15

  1.  Men alle Toldere og Syndere holdt sig nær til ham for at høre
      ham.
  2.  Og både Farisæerne og de skriftkloge knurrede og sagde: "Denne
      tager imod Syndere og spiser med dem."
  3.  Men han talte denne Lignelse til dem og sagde:
  4.  "Hvilket Menneske af eder, som har hundrede Får og har mistet
      eet af dem, forlader ikke de ni og halvfemsindstyve i Ørkenen og
      går ud efter det, han har mistet, indtil han finder det?
  5.  Og når han har fundet det, lægger han det på sine Skuldre med
      Glæde.
  6.  Og når han kommer hjem, sammenkalder han sine Venner og Naboer
      og siger til dem: Glæder eder med mig; thi jeg har fundet mit
      Får, som jeg havde mistet.
  7.  Jeg siger eder: Således skal der være Glæde i Himmelen over een
      Synder, som omvender sig, mere end over ni og halvfemsindstyve
      retfærdige, som ikke trænge til Omvendelse.

  8.  Eller hvilken Kvinde, som har ti Drakmer og taber een Drakme,
      tænder ikke Lys og fejer Huset og søger med Flid, indtil hun
      finder den?
  9.  Og når hun har fundet den, sammenkalder hun sine Veninder og
      Naboersker og siger: Glæder eder med mig; thi jeg har fundet den
      Drakme, som jeg havde tabt.
 10.  Således, siger jeg eder, bliver der Glæde hos Guds Engle over
      een Synder, som omvender sig."

 11.  Men han sagde: "En Mand havde to Sønner.
 12.  Og den yngste af dem sagde til Faderen: Fader! giv mig den Del
      af Formuen, som tilfalder mig. Og han skiftede Godset imellem
      dem.
 13.  Og ikke mange Dage derefter samlede den yngste Søn alt sit og
      drog udenlands til et fjernt Land og ødte der sin Formue i et
      ryggesløst Levned.
 14.  Men da han havde sat alt til, blev der en svær Hungersnød i det
      samme Land; og han begyndte at lide Mangel.
 15.  Og han gik hen og holdt sig til en af Borgerne der i Landet, og
      denne sendte ham ud på sine Marker for at vogte Svin.
 16.  Og han attråede at fylde sin Bug med de Bønner, som Svinene åde;
      og ingen gav ham noget.
 17.  Men han gik i sig selv og sagde: Hvor mange Daglejere hos min
      Fader have ikke Brød i Overflødighed? men jeg omkommer her af
      Hunger.
 18.  Jeg vil stå op og gå til min Fader og sige til ham: Fader! jeg
      har syndet imod Himmelen og over for dig,
 19.  jeg er ikke længer værd at kaldes din Søn, gør mig som en af
      dine Daglejere!
 20.  Og han stod op og kom til sin Fader. Men da han endnu var langt
      borte, så hans Fader ham og ynkedes inderligt, og han løb til og
      faldt ham om Halsen og kyssede ham.
 21.  Men Sønnen sagde til ham: Fader! jeg har syndet imod Himmelen og
      over for dig, jeg er ikke længer værd at kaldes din Søn.
 22.  Men Faderen sagde til sine Tjenere: Henter det bedste Klædebon
      frem, og ifører ham det, og giver ham en Ring på hans Hånd og
      Sko på Fødderne;
 23.  og henter Fedekalven og slagter den, og lader os spise og være
      lystige!
 24.  Thi denne min Søn var død og er bleven levende igen, han var
      fortabt og er funden. Og de begyndte at være lystige!
 25.  Men hans ældste Søn var på Marken, og da han kom og nærmede sig
      Huset, hørte han Musik og Dans.
 26.  Og han kaldte en af Karlene til sig og spurgte, hvad dette var?
 27.  Men han sagde til ham: Din Broder er kommen, og din Fader har
      slagtet Fedekalven, fordi han har fået ham sund igen.
 28.  Men han blev vred og vilde ikke gå ind. Men hans Fader gik ud og
      bad ham.
 29.  Men han svarede og sagde til Faderen: Se, så mange År har jeg
      tjent dig, og aldrig har jeg overtrådt noget af dine Bud, og du
      har aldrig givet mig et Kid, for at jeg kunde være lystig med
      mine Venner.
 30.  Men da denne din Søn kom, som har fortæret dit Gods med Skøger,
      slagtede du Fedekalven til ham.
 31.  Men han sagde til ham: Barn! du er altid hos mig, og alt mit er
      dit.
 32.  Men man burde være lystig og glæde sig, fordi denne din Broder
      var død og er bleven levende og var fortabt og er funden."

Lukas 16

  1.  Men han sagde også til Disciplene: "Der var en rig Mand, som
      havde en Husholder, og denne blev angiven for ham som en, der
      ødte hans Ejendom.
  2.  Og han lod ham kalde og sagde til ham: Hvad er dette, jeg hører
      om dig? Aflæg Regnskabet for din Husholdning; thi du kan ikke
      længer være Husholder.
  3.  Men Husholderen sagde ved sig selv: Hvad skal jeg gøre, efterdi
      min Herre tager Husholdningen fra mig? Jeg formår ikke at Grave,
      jeg skammer mig ved at tigge.
  4.  Nu ved jeg, hvad jeg vil gøre, for af de skulle modtage mig i
      deres Huse, når jeg bliver sat fra Husholdningen.
  5.  Og han kaldte hver enkelt af sin Herres Skyldnere til sig og
      sagde til den første: Hvor meget er du min Herre skyldig?
  6.  Men han sagde: Hundrede Fade Olie. Og han sagde til ham: Tag dit
      Skyldbrev, og sæt dig hurtig ned og skriv halvtredsindstyve!
  7.  Derefter sagde han til en anden: Men du, hvor meget er du
      skyldig?  Men han sagde: Hundrede Mål Hvede. Han siger til ham:
      Tag dit Skyldbrev og skriv firsindstyve!
  8.  Og Herren roste den uretfærdige Husholder, fordi han havde
      handlet klogelig; thi denne Verdens Børn ere klogere end Lysets
      Børn imod deres egen Slægt.
  9.  Og jeg siger eder: Gører eder Venner ved Uretfærdighedens
      Mammon, for at de, når det er forbi med den, må modtage eder i
      de evige Boliger.
 10.  Den, som er tro i det mindste, er også tro i meget, og den, som
      er uretfærdig i det mindste, er også uretfærdig i meget.
 11.  Dersom I da ikke have været tro i den uretfærdige Mammon, hvem
      vil da betro eder den sande?
 12.  Og dersom I ikke have været tro i det, som andre eje, hvem vil
      da give eder noget selv at eje?
 13.  Ingen Tjener kan tjene to Herrer; thi han vil enten hade den ene
      og elske den anden, eller holde sig til den ene og ringeagte den
      anden; I kunne ikke tjene Gud og Mammon."

 14.  Men alt dette hørte Farisæerne, som vare pengegerrige, og de
      spottede ham.
 15.  Og han sagde til dem: "I ere de, som gøre eder selv retfærdige
      for Menneskene; men Gud kender eders Hjerter; thi det, som er
      højt iblandt Mennesker, er en Vederstyggelighed for Gud.
 16.  Loven og Profeterne vare indtil Johannes; fra den Tid forkyndes
      Evangeliet om Guds Rige, og enhver trænger derind med Vold.
 17.  Men det er lettere, at Himmelen og Jorden forgå, end at en
      Tøddel af Loven bortfalder.
 18.  Hver, som skiller sig fra sin Hustru og tager en anden til Ægte,
      bedriver Hor; og hver, som tager til Ægte en Kvinde, der er
      skilt fra sin Mand, bedriver Hor.

 19.  Men der var en rig Mand, og han klædte sig i Purpur og kostbart
      Linned og levede hver Dag i Fryd og Herlighed.
 20.  Men en fattig ved Navn Lazarus var lagt ved hans Port, fuld af
      Sår.
 21.  Og han attråede at mættes af det, som faldt fra den Riges Bord;
      men også Hundene kom og slikkede hans Sår.
 22.  Men det skete, at den fattige døde, og at han blev henbåren af
      Englene i Abrahams Skød; men den rige døde også og blev
      begravet.
 23.  Og da han slog sine Øjne op i Dødsriget, hvor han var i Pine,
      ser han Abraham langt borte og Lazarus i hans Skød.
 24.  Og han råbte og sagde: Fader Abraham! forbarm dig over mig, og
      send Lazarus, for at han kan dyppe det yderste af sin Finger i
      Vand og læske min Tunge; thi jeg pines svarlig i denne Lue.
 25.  Men Abraham sagde: Barn! kom i Hu, at du har fået dit gode i din
      Livstid, og Lazarus ligeså det onde; men nu trøstes han her, og
      du pines.
 26.  Og foruden alt dette er der fæstet et stort Svælg imellem os og
      eder, for at de, som ville fare herfra over til eder, ikke
      skulle kunne det, og de ikke heller skulle fare derfra over til
      os.
 27.  Men han sagde: Så beder jeg dig, Fader! at du vil sende ham til
      min Faders Hus
 28.  thi jeg har fem Brødre for at han kan vidne for dem, for at ikke
      også de skulle komme i dette Pinested.
 29.  Men Abraham siger til ham: De have Moses og Profeterne, lad dem
      høre dem!
 30.  Men han sagde: Nej, Fader Abraham! men dersom nogen fra de døde
      kommer til dem, ville de omvende sig.
 31.  Men han sagde til ham: Høre de ikke Moses og Profeterne, da lade
      de sig heller ikke overbevise, om nogen opstår fra de døde."

Lukas 17

  1.  Men han sagde til sine Disciple: "Det er umuligt, at Forargelser
      ikke skulde komme; men ve den, ved hvem de komme!
  2.  Det er bedre for ham, om en Møllesten er lagt om hans Hals, og
      han er kastet i Havet end at han skulde forarge een af disse
      små.
  3.  Vogter på eder selv! Dersom din Broder synder, da irettesæt ham;
      og dersom han angrer, da tilgiv ham!
  4.  Og dersom han syv Gange om Dagen synder imod dig og syv Gange
      vender tilbage til dig og siger: Jeg angrer det, da skal du
      tilgive ham."

  5.  Og Apostlene sagde til Herren: "Giv os mere Tro!"
  6.  Men Herren sagde: "Dersom I havde Tro som et Sennepskorn, da
      kunde I sige til dette Morbærfigentræ: Ryk dig op med Rode, og
      plant dig i Havet, og det skulde adlyde eder.
  7.  Men hvem af eder, som har en Tjener, der pløjer eller vogter,
      siger til ham, når han kommer hjem fra Marken: Gå straks hen og
      sæt dig til Bords?
  8.  Vil han ikke tværtimod sige til ham: Tilbered, hvad jeg skal
      have til Nadver, og bind op om dig, og vart mig op, medens jeg
      spiser og drikker; og derefter må du spise og drikke?
  9.  Mon han takker Tjeneren, fordi han gjorde det, som var befalet?
      Jeg mener det ikke.
 10.  Således skulle også I, når I have gjort alle de Ting, som ere
      eder befalede, sige: Vi ere unyttige Tjenere; kun hvad vi vare
      skyldige at gøre, have vi gjort."

 11.  Og det skete, medens han var på Vej til Jerusalem, at han drog
      midt imellem Samaria og Galilæa.
 12.  Og da han gik ind i en Landsby, mødte der ham ti spedalske Mænd,
      som stode langt borte,
 13.  og de opløftede Røsten og sagde: "Jesus, Mester, forbarm dig
      over os!"
 14.  Og da han så dem, sagde han til dem: "Går hen og fremstiller
      eder for Præsterne!" Og det skete, medens de gik bort, bleve de
      rensede.
 15.  Men en af dem vendte tilbage, da han så, at han var helbredt, og
      priste Gud med høj Røst.
 16.  Og han faldt på sit Ansigt for hans Fødder og takkede ham; og
      denne var en Samaritan.
 17.  Men Jesus svarede og sagde: "Bleve ikke de ti rensede? hvor ere
      de ni?
 18.  Fandtes der ingen, som vendte tilbage for at give Gud Ære, uden
      denne fremmede?"
 19.  Og han sagde til ham:"Stå op, gå bort; din Tro har frelst dig!"

 20.  Men da han blev spurgt af Farisæerne om, når Guds Rige kommer,
      svarede han dem og sagde: "Guds Rige kommer ikke således, at man
      kan vise derpå.
 21.  Ikke heller vil man sige: Se her, eller: Se der er det; thi se,
      Guds Rige er inden i eder."

 22.  Men han sagde til Disciplene: "Der skal komme Dage, da I skulle
      attrå at se en af Menneskesønnens Dage, og I skulle ikke se den.
 23.  Og siger man til eder: Se der, eller: Se her er han, så går ikke
      derhen, og løber ikke derefter!
 24.  Thi ligesom Lynet, når det lyner fra den ene Side af Himmelen,
      skinner til den anden Side af Himmelen, således skal
      Menneskesønnen være på sin Dag.
 25.  Men først bør han lide meget og forkastes af denne Slægt.
 26.  Og som det skete i Noas Dage, således skal det også være i
      Menneskesønnens Dage:
 27.  De spiste, drak, toge til Ægte, bleve bortgiftede indtil den
      Dag, da Noa gik ind i Arken, og Syndfloden kom og ødelagde alle.
 28.  Ligeledes, som det skete i Loths Dage: De spiste, drak, købte,
      solgte, plantede, byggede;
 29.  men på den Dag, da Loth gik ud af Sodoma, regnede Ild og Svovl
      ned fra Himmelen og ødelagde dem alle:
 30.  på samme Måde skal det være på den Dag, da Menneskesønnen
      åbenbares.
 31.  På den dag skal den, som er på Taget og har sine Ejendele i
      Huset, ikke stige ned for at hente dem; og ligeså skal den, som
      er på Marken, ikke vende tilbage igen!
 32.  Kommer Loths Hustru i Hu!
 33.  Den, som søger at bjærge sit Liv, skal miste det; og den, som
      mister det, skal beholde Livet.
 34.  Jeg siger eder: I den Nat skulle to Mænd være på eet Leje; den
      ene skal tages med, og den anden skal lades tilbage.
 35.  To Kvinder skulle male på samme Kværn; den ene skal tages med,
      og den anden skal lades tilbage.
 36.  To Mænd skulle være på Marken; den ene skal tages med. og den
      anden skal lades tilbage."
 37.  Og de svare og sige til ham: "Hvor, Herre?" Men han sagde til
      dem: "Hvor Ådselet er, der ville også Ørnene samle sig."

Lukas 18

  1.  Men han talte til dem en Lignelse om, at de burde altid bede og
      ikke blive trætte,
  2.  og sagde: "Der var i en By en Dommer, som ikke frygtede Gud og
      ikke undså sig for noget Menneske.
  3.  Og der var en Enke i den By, og hun kom til ham og sagde: Skaf
      mig Ret over min Modpart!
  4.  Og længe vilde han ikke. Men derefter sagde han ved sig selv: Om
      jeg end ikke frygter Gud, ej heller undser mig for noget
      Menneske,
  5.  så vil jeg dog, efterdi denne Enke volder mig Besvær, skaffe
      Hende Ret, for at hun ikke uophørligt skal komme og plage mig."
  6.  Men Herren sagde: "Hører, hvad den uretfærdige Dommer siger!
  7.  Skulde da Gud ikke skaffe sine udvalgte Ret, de, som råbe til
      ham Dag og Nat? og er han ikke langmodig, når det gælder dem?
  8.  Jeg siger eder, han skal skaffe dem Ret i Hast. Men mon
      Menneskesønnen, når han kommer, vil finde Troen på Jorden?"

  9.  Men han sagde også til nogle, som stolede på sig selv, at de
      vare retfærdige, og foragtede de andre, denne Lignelse:
 10.  "Der gik to Mænd op til Helligdommen for at bede; den ene var en
      Farisæer, og den anden en Tolder.
 11.  Farisæeren stod og bad ved sig selv således: Gud! Jeg takker
      dig, fordi jeg ikke er som de andre Mennesker, Røvere,
      uretfærdige, Horkarle, eller også som denne Tolder.
 12.  Jeg faster to Gange om Ugen, jeg giver Tiende af al min indtægt.
 13.  Men Tolderen stod langt borte og vilde end ikke opløfte Øjnene
      til Himmelen, men slog sig for sit Bryst og sagde: Gud, vær mig
      Synder nådig!
 14.  Jeg siger eder: Denne gik retfærdiggjort hjem til sit Hus
      fremfor den anden; thi enhver, som Ophøjer sig selv, skal
      fornedres; men den, som fornedrer sig selv, skal ophøjes."

 15.  Men de bare også de små Børn til ham, for at han skulde røre ved
      dem; men da Disciplene så det, truede de dem.
 16.  Men Jesus kaldte dem til sig og sagde: "Lader de små Børn komme
      til mig, og formener dem det ikke; thi Guds Rige hører sådanne
      til.
 17.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, den, som ikke modtager Guds Rige
      ligesom et lille Barn, han skal ingenlunde komme ind i det."

 18.  Og en af de Øverste spurgte ham og sagde: "Gode Mester! hvad
      skal jeg gøre, for at jeg kan arve et evigt Liv?"
 19.  Men Jesus sagde til ham: "Hvorfor kalder du mig god? Ingen er
      god uden een, nemlig Gud.
 20.  Du kender Budene: Du må ikke bedrive Hor; du må ikke slå ihjel;
      du må ikke stjæle; du må ikke sige falsk Vidnesbyrd; Ær din
      Fader og din Moder."
 21.  Men han sagde: "Det har jeg holdt alt sammen fra min Ungdom af."
 22.  Men da Jesus hørte det, sagde han til ham: "Endnu een Ting
      fattes dig: Sælg alt, hvad du har, og uddel det til fattige, så
      skal du have en Skat i Himmelen; og kom så og følg mig!"
 23.  Men da han hørte dette, blev han dybt bedrøvet; thi han var såre
      rig.
 24.  Men da Jesus så, at han blev dybt bedrøvet, sagde han: "Hvor
      vanskeligt komme de, som have Rigdom, ind i Guds Rige!
 25.  thi det er lettere for en Kamel at gå igennem et Nåleøje end for
      en rig at gå ind i Guds Rige."
 26.  Men de, som hørte det, sagde: "Hvem kan da blive frelst?"
 27.  Men han sagde: "Hvad der er umuligt for Mennesker, det er muligt
      for Gud."
 28.  Men Peter sagde: "Se, vi have forladt vort eget og fulgt dig."
 29.  Men han sagde til dem: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, der er ingen,
      som har forladt Hus eller Forældre eller Brødre eller Hustru
      eller Børn for Guds Riges Skyld,
 30.  uden at han skal få det mange Fold igen i denne Tid og i den
      kommende Verden et evigt Liv."

 31.  Men han tog de tolv til sig og sagde til dem: "Se, vi drage op
      til Jerusalem, og alle de Ting, som ere skrevne ved Profeterne,
      skulle fuldbyrdes på Menneskesønnen.
 32.  Thi han skal overgives til Hedningerne og spottes, forhånes og
      bespyttes,
 33.  og de skulle hudstryge og ihjelslå ham; og på den tredje Dag
      skal han opstå."
 34.  Og de fattede intet deraf, og dette Ord var skjult for dem, og
      de forstode ikke det, som blev sagt.

 35.  Men det skete, da han nærmede sig til Jeriko, sad der en blind
      ved Vejen og tiggede.
 36.  Og da han hørte en Skare gå forbi, spurgte han, hvad dette var.
 37.  Men de fortalte ham, at Jesus af Nazareth kom forbi.
 38.  Og han råbte og sagde:"Jesus, du Davids Søn,forbarm dig over
      mig!"
 39.  Og de, som gik foran, truede ham, for at han skulde tie; men han
      råbte meget stærkere: "Du Davids Søn, forbarm dig over mig!"
 40.  Og Jesus stod stille og bød, at han skulde føres til ham; men da
      han kom nær til ham, spurgte han ham og sagde:
 41.  "Hvad vil du, at jeg skal gøre for dig?" Men han sagde: "Herre!
      at jeg må blive seende."
 42.  Og Jesus sagde til ham: "Bliv seende! din Tro har frelst dig."
 43.  Og straks blev han seende, og han fulgte ham og priste Gud; og
      hele Folket lovpriste Gud, da de så det.

Lukas 19

  1.  Og han kom ind i Jeriko og drog derigennem.
  2.  Og se, der var en Mand, som hed Zakæus; han var Overtolder, og
      han var rig.
  3.  Og han søgte at få at se, hvem der var Jesus, og kunde ikke for
      Skaren, fordi han var lille af Vækst.
  4.  Og han løb forud og steg op i et Morbær Figentræ, for at han
      kunde se ham; thi han skulde komme frem ad den Vej.
  5.  Og da Jesus kom til Stedet, så han op og blev ham var og sagde
      til ham: "Zakæus! skynd dig og stig ned; thi jeg skal i Dag
      blive i dit Hus."
  6.  Og han skyndte sig og steg ned og tog imod ham med Glæde.
  7.  Og da de så det, knurrede de alle og sagde: "Han er gået ind for
      at tage Herberge hos en syndig Mand."
  8.  Men Zakæus stod frem og sagde til Herren: "Se, Herre! Halvdelen
      af min Ejendom giver jeg de fattige; og dersom jeg har besveget
      nogen for noget, da giver jeg det fire Fold igen."
  9.  Men Jesus sagde til ham: "I Dag er der blevet dette Hus Frelse
      til Del, efterdi også han er en Abrahams Søn;
 10.  thi Menneskesønnen er kommen for at søge og frelse det
      fortabte."

 11.  Men medens de hørte på dette, fortsatte han og sagde en
      Lignelse, fordi han var nær ved Jerusalem, og de mente, at Guds
      Rige skulde straks komme til Syne.
 12.  Han sagde da: "En højbåren Mand drog til et fjernt Land for at
      få Kongemagt og vende tilbage igen.
 13.  Men han kaldte ti af sine Tjenere og gav dem ti Pund og sagde
      til dem: Købslår dermed, indtil jeg kommer.
 14.  Men hans Medborgere hadede ham og skikkede Sendebud efter ham og
      lod sige: Vi ville ikke, at denne skal være Konge over os.
 15.  Og det skete, da han kom igen, efter at han havde fået
      Kongemagten, sagde han, at disse Tjenere, hvem han havde givet
      Pengene, skulde kaldes for ham, for at han kunde få at vide,
      hvad hver havde vundet.
 16.  Og den første trådte frem og sagde: Herre! dit Pund har
      erhvervet ti Pund til.
 17.  Og han sagde til ham: Vel, du gode Tjener! efterdi du har været
      tro i det mindste, skal du have Magt over ti Byer.
 18.  Og den anden kom og sagde: Herre! dit Pund har indbragt fem
      Pund.
 19.  Men han sagde også til denne: Og du skal være over fem Byer.
 20.  Og en anden kom og sagde: Herre! se, her er dit Pund, som jeg
      har haft liggende i et Tørklæde.
 21.  Thi jeg frygtede for dig, efterdi du er en streng Mand; du
      tager, hvad du ikke lagde, og høster, hvad du ikke såede.
 22.  Han siger til ham: Efter din egen Mund dømmer jeg dig, du onde
      Tjener! Du vidste, at jeg er en streng Mand, som tager, hvad jeg
      ikke lagde, og høster, hvad jeg ikke såede;
 23.  hvorfor gav du da ikke mine Penge til Vekselbordet, så jeg ved
      min Hjemkomst kunde have krævet dem med Rente?
 24.  Og han sagde til dem, som stode hos: Tager Pundet fra ham, og
      giver det til ham, som har de ti Pund.
 25.  Og de sagde til ham: Herre! han har ti Pund.
 26.  Jeg siger eder, at enhver, som har, ham skal der gives; men den,
      som ikke har, fra ham skal endog det tages, som han har.
 27.  Men fører disse mine Fjender hid, som ikke vilde, at jeg skulde
      være Konge over dem, og hugger dem ned for mine Øjne!"

 28.  Og da han havde sagt dette, gik han foran og drog op til
      Jerusalem.
 29.  Og det skete, da han nærmede sig til Bethfage og Bethania ved
      det Bjerg, som kaldes Oliebjerget, udsendte han to af sine
      Disciple og sagde:
 30.  "Går hen til den Landsby, som ligger lige for eder. Når I komme
      derind, skulle I finde et Føl bundet, på hvilket der endnu
      aldrig har siddet noget Menneske; og løser det, og fører det
      hid!
 31.  Og dersom nogen spørger eder: Hvorfor løse I det? da skulle I
      sige således: Herren har Brug for det."
 32.  Men de udsendte gik hen og fandt det, ligesom han havde sagt
      dem.
 33.  Men da de løste Føllet, sagde dets Herrer til dem: "Hvorfor løse
      I Føllet?"
 34.  Og de sagde: "Herren har Brug for det."
 35.  Og de førte det til Jesus, og de lagde deres Klæder på Føllet og
      lod Jesus sætte sig derpå.
 36.  Og da han drog frem, bredte de deres Klæder under ham på Vejen.
 37.  Men da han nu nærmede sig til Nedgangen fra Oliebjerget,
      begyndte hele Disciplenes Mængde med Glæde at prise Gud med høj
      Røst for alle de kraftige Gerninger, som de havde set, og de
      sagde:
 38.  "Velsignet være Kongen, som kommer, i Herrens Navn! Fred i
      Himmelen, og Ære i det højeste!"
 39.  Og nogle af Farisæerne i Skaren sagde til ham: "Mester!
      irettesæt dine Disciple!"
 40.  Og han svarede og sagde til dem: "Jeg siger eder, at hvis disse
      tie, skulle Stenene råbe."

 41.  Og da han kom nær til og så Staden, græd han over den og sagde:
 42.  "Vidste dog også du, ja, selv på denne din Dag, hvad der tjener
      til din Fred! Men nu er det skjult for dine Øjne.
 43.  Thi der skal komme Dage over dig, da dine Fjender skulle kaste
      en Vold op omkring dig og omringe dig og trænge dig alle Vegne
      fra;
 44.  og de skulle lægge dig helt øde og dine Børn i dig og ikke lade
      Sten på Sten tilbage i dig, fordi du ikke kendte din Besøgelses
      Tid."

 45.  Og han gik ind i Helligdommen og begyndte at uddrive dem, som
      solgte,
 46.  og sagde til dem: "Der er skrevet: Og mit Hus er et Bedehus; men
      I have gjort det til en Røverkule."
 47.  Og han lærte daglig i Helligdommen; men Ypperstepræsterne og de
      skriftkloge og de første i Folket søgte at slå ham ihjel.
 48.  Og de fandt ikke, hvad de skulde gøre; thi hele Folket hang ved
      ham og hørte ham.

Lukas 20

  1.  Og det skete på en af de Dage, medens han lærte folket i
      Helligdommen og forkyndte Evangeliet, da trådte
      Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge tillige med de Ældste hen
      til ham.
  2.  Og de talte til ham og sagde: "Sig os, af hvad Magt gør du disse
      Ting, eller hvem er det, som har givet dig denne Magt?"
  3.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Også jeg vil spørge eder om
      en Ting, siger mig det:
  4.  Johannes's Dåb, var den fra Himmelen eller fra Mennesker?"
  5.  Men de overvejede med hverandre og sagde: "Sige vi: Fra
      Himmelen, da vil han sige: Hvorfor troede I ham ikke?
  6.  Men sige vi: Fra Mennesker, da vil hele Folket stene os; thi det
      er overbevist om, at Johannes var en Profet."
  7.  Og de svarede, at de vidste ikke hvorfra.
  8.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "Så siger ikke heller jeg eder, af hvad
      Magt jeg gør disse Ting."

  9.  Men han begyndte at sige denne Lignelse til Folket: "En Mand
      plantede en Vingård og lejede den ud til Vingårdsmænd og drog
      udenlands for lange Tider.
 10.  Og da Tiden kom, sendte han en Tjener til Vingårdsmændene, for
      at de skulde give ham af Vingårdens Frugt; men Vingårdsmændene
      sloge ham og sendte ham tomhændet bort.
 11.  Og han sendte fremdeles en anden Tjener; men de sloge også ham
      og forhånede ham og sendte ham tomhændet bort.
 12.  Og han sendte fremdeles en tredje; men også ham sårede de og
      kastede ham ud.
 13.  Men Vingårdens Herre sagde: Hvad skal jeg gøre? Jeg vil sende
      min Søn, den elskede; de ville dog vel undse sig, for ham.
 14.  Men da Vingårdsmændene så ham, rådsloge de indbyrdes og sagde:
      Det er Arvingen; lader os slå ham ihjel, for at Arven kan blive
      vor.
 15.  Og de kastede ham ud af Vingården og sloge ham ihjel. Hvad vil
      nu Vingårdens Herre gøre ved dem?
 16.  Han vil komme og ødelægge disse Vingårdsmænd og give Vingården
      til andre." Men da de hørte det, sagde de: "Det ske aldrig!"
 17.  Men han så på dem og sagde: "Hvad er da dette, som er skrevet:
      Den Sten, som Bygningsmændene forkastede, den er bleven til en
      Hovedhjørnesten?
 18.  Hver, som falder på denne Sten, skal slå sig sønder; men hvem
      den falder på, ham skal den knuse."
 19.  Og Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge søgte at lægge Hånd på
      ham i den samme Time, men de frygtede for Folket; thi de
      forstode, at han sagde denne Lignelse imod dem.

 20.  Og de toge Vare på ham og udsendte Lurere, der anstillede sig,
      som om de vare retfærdige, for at fange ham i Ord, så de kunde
      overgive ham til Øvrigheden og Landshøvdingens Magt.
 21.  Og de spurgte ham og sagde: "Mester! vi vide, at du taler og
      lærer Rettelig og ikke ser på Personer, men lærer Guds Vej i
      Sandhed.
 22.  Er det os tilladt at give Kejseren Skat eller ej?"
 23.  Men da han mærkede deres Træskhed, sagde han til dem: "Hvorfor
      friste I mig?
 24.  Viser mig en Denar"; hvis Billede og Overskrift bærer den?" Men
      de svarede og sagde: "Kejserens."
 25.  Men han sagde til dem: "Så giver da Kejseren, hvad Kejserens er,
      og Gud, hvad Guds er."
 26.  Og de kunde ikke fange ham i Ord i Folkets Påhør, og de
      forundrede sig over hans Svar og tav.

 27.  Men nogle af Saddukæerne, som nægte, at der er Opstandelse, kom
      til ham og spurgte ham og sagde:
 28.  "Mester! Moses har foreskrevet os: Dersom en har en Broder, som
      er gift, og denne dør barnløs, da skal hans Broder tage Hustruen
      og oprejse sin Broder Afkom.
 29.  Nu var der syv Brødre; og den første tog en Hustru og døde
      barnløs.
 30.  Ligeså den anden.
 31.  Og den tredje tog hende, og således også alle syv; de døde uden
      at efterlade Børn.
 32.  Men til sidst døde også Hustruen.
 33.  Hvem af dem får hende så til Hustru i Opstandelsen? thi de have
      alle syv haft hende til Hustru."
 34.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "Denne Verdens Børn tage til Ægte og
      bortgiftes;
 35.  men de, som agtes værdige til at få Del i hin Verden og i
      Opstandelsen fra de døde, tage hverken til Ægte eller
      bortgiftes.
 36.  Thi de kunne ikke mere dø; thi de ere Engle lige og ere Guds
      Børn, idet de ere Opstandelsens Børn.
 37.  Men at de døde oprejses, har også Moses givet til Kende i Stedet
      om Tornebusken, når han kalder Herren: Abrahams Gud og Isaks Gud
      og Jakobs Gud.
 38.  Men han er ikke dødes, men levendes Gud; thi for ham leve de
      alle."
 39.  Men nogle af de skriftkloge svarede og sagde: "Mester! du talte
      vel."
 40.  Og de turde ikke mere spørge ham om noget.

 41.  Men han sagde til dem: "Hvorledes siger man, at Kristus er
      Davids Søn?
 42.  David selv siger jo i Salmernes Bog: Herren sagde til min Herre:
      Sæt dig ved min højre Hånd,
 43.  indtil jeg får lagt dine Fjender som en Skammel for dine Fødder.
 44.  Altså kalder David ham en Herre, hvorledes er han da hans Søn?"

 45.  Men i hele Folkets Påhør sagde han til Disciplene:
 46.  "Vogter eder for de skriftkloge. som gerne ville gå i lange
      Klæder og holde af at lade sig hilse på Torvene og at have de
      fornemste Pladser i Synagogerne og at sidde øverst til Bords ved
      Måltiderne,
 47.  de, som opæde Enkers Huse og på Skrømt bede længe; disse skulle
      få des hårdere Dom."

Lukas 21

  1.  Men idet han så op, fik han Øje på de rige, som lagde deres
      Gaver i Tempelblokken.
  2.  Men han så en fattig Enke. som lagde to Skærve deri.
  3.  Og han sagde: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, at denne fattige Enke
      lagde mere i end de alle.
  4.  Thi alle disse lagde af deres Overflod hen til Gaverne; men hun
      lagde af sin Fattigdom al sin Ejendom, som hun havde."

  5.  Og da nogle sagde om Helligdommen, at den var prydet med smukke
      Sten og Tempelgaver. sagde han:
  6.  "Disse Ting, som I se - der skal komme Dage, da der ikke lades
      Sten på Sten, som jo skal nedbrydes."
  7.  Men de spurgte ham og sagde: "Mester! når skal dette da ske? og
      hvad er Tegnet på, når dette skal ske?"
  8.  Men han sagde: "Ser til, at I ikke blive forførte; thi mange
      skulle på mit Navn komme og sige: Det er mig, og: Tiden er
      kommen nær. Går ikke efter dem!
  9.  Men når I høre om Krige og Oprør, da forskrækkes ikke; thi dette
      må først ske, men Enden er der ikke straks."
 10.  Da sagde han til dem: "Folk skal rejse sig imod Folk, og Rige
      imod Rige.
 11.  Og store Jordskælv skal der være her og der og Hungersnød og
      Pest, og der skal ske frygtelige Ting og store Tegn fra
      Himmelen.
 12.  Men forud for alt dette skulle de lægge Hånd på eder og forfølge
      eder og overgive eder til Synagoger og Fængsler, og I skulle
      føres frem for Konger og Landshøvdinger for mit Navns Skyld.
 13.  Det skal falde ud for eder til Vidnesbyrd.
 14.  Lægger det da på Hjerte, at I ikke forud skulle overtænke,
      hvorledes I skulde forsvare eder.
 15.  Thi jeg, vil give eder Mund og Visdom, som alle eders
      Modstandere ikke skulle kunne modstå eller modsige.
 16.  Men I skulle endog forrådes af Forældre og Brødre og Frænder og
      Venner, og de skulle slå nogle af eder ihjel.
 17.  Og I skulle hades af alle for mit Navns Skyld.
 18.  Og ikke et Hår på eders Hoved skal gå tabt.
 19.  Ved eders Udholdenhed skulle I vinde eders Sjæle.
 20.  Men når I se Jerusalem omringet af Krigshære, da forstår, at
      dens Ødelæggelse er kommen nær.
 21.  Da skulle de, som ere i Judæa, fly til Bjergene; og de, som ere
      inde i Staden, skulle vige bort derfra; og de, som ere på
      Landet, skulle ikke gå ind i den.
 22.  Thi disse ere Hævnens Dage, da alt, hvad skrevet er, skal
      opfyldes.
 23.  Men ve de frugtsommelige og dem, som give Die, i de Dage; thi
      der skal være stor Nød på Jorden og Vrede over dette Folk.
 24.  Og de skulle falde for Sværdets Od og føres fangne til alle
      Hedningerne; og Jerusalem skal nedtrædes af Hedningerne, indtil
      Hedningernes Tider fuldkommes.
 25.  Og der skal ske Tegn i Sol og Måne og Stjerner, og på Jorden
      skulle Folkene ængstes i Fortvivlelse over Havets og Bølgernes
      Brusen,
 26.  medens Mennesker forsmægte af Frygt og Forventning om de Ting,
      som komme over Jorderige; thi Himmelens Kræfter skulle rystes.
 27.  Og da skulle de se Menneskesønnen komme i Sky med Kraft og megen
      Herlighed.
 28.  Men når disse Ting begynde at ske, da ser op og opløfter eders
      Hoveder, efterdi eders Forløsning stunder til."
 29.  Og han sagde dem en Lignelse: "Ser Figentræet og alle Træerne;
 30.  når de alt springe ud, da se I og skønne af eder selv, at
      Sommeren nu er nær.
 31.  Således skulle også I, når I se disse Ting ske, skønne, at Guds
      Rige er nær.
 32.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, at denne Slægt skal ingenlunde forgå,
      førend det er sket alt sammen.
 33.  Himmelen og Jorden skulle forgå; men mine Ord skulle ingenlunde
      forgå.
 34.  Men vogter eder, at eders Hjerter ikke, nogen Tid besværes af
      Svir og Drukkenskab og timelige Bekymringer, så hin dag kommer
      pludseligt over eder som en Snare.
 35.  Thi komme skal den over alle dem, der bo på hele Jordens Flade.
 36.  Og våger og beder til enhver Tid, for at I må blive i Stand til
      at undfly alle disse Ting, som skulle ske, og bestå for
      Menneskesønnen."
 37.  Men han lærte om Dagene i Helligdommen, men om Nætterne gik han
      ud og overnattede på det Bjerg, som kaldes Oliebjerget.
 38.  Og hele Folket kom årle til ham i Helligdommen for at høre ham.

Lukas 22

  1.  Men de usyrede Brøds Højtid, som kaldes Påske, nærmede sig.
  2.  Og Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge søgte, hvorledes de kunde
      slå ham ihjel; thi de frygtede for Folket.
  3.  Men Satan gik ind i Judas, som kaldes Iskariot og var en af de
      tolv.
  4.  Og han gik hen og talte med Ypperstepræsterne og Høvedsmændene
      om, hvorledes han vilde forråde ham til dem.
  5.  Og de bleve glade og lovede at give ham Penge.
  6.  Og han tilsagde det; og han søgte Lejlighed til at forråde ham
      til dem uden Opløb.

  7.  Men de usyrede Brøds Dag kom, på hvilken man skulde slagte
      Påskelammet.
  8.  Og han udsendte Peter og Johannes og sagde: "Går hen og bereder
      os Påskelammet, at vi kunne spise det."
  9.  Men de sagde til ham: "Hvor vil du, at vi skulle berede det?"
 10.  Men han sagde til dem: "Se, når I ere komne ind i Staden, skal
      der møde eder en Mand, som bærer en Vandkrukke; følger ham til
      Huset, hvor han går ind,
 11.  og I skulle sige til Husbonden i Huset: Mesteren siger: Hvor er
      det Herberge, hvor jeg kan spise Påskelammet med mine Disciple?
 12.  Og han skal vise eder en stor Sal opdækket; der skulle I berede
      det."
 13.  Og de gik hen og fandt det således, som han havde sagt dem; og
      de beredte Påskelammet.
 14.  Og da Timen kom, satte han sig til Bords, og Apostlene med ham.
 15.  Og han sagde til dem: "Jeg har hjerteligt længtes efter at spise
      dette Påskelam med eder, førend jeg lider.
 16.  Thi jeg siger eder, at jeg skal ingen Sinde mere spise det,
      førend det bliver fuldkommet i Guds Rige."
 17.  Og han tog en Kalk, takkede og sagde: "Tager dette, og deler det
      imellem eder!
 18.  Thi jeg siger eder, at fra nu af skal jeg ikke drikke af
      Vintræets Frugt, førend Guds Rige kommer."
 19.  Og han tog Brød, takkede og brød det og gav dem det og sagde:
      "Dette er mit Legeme, det, som gives for eder; gører dette til
      min Ihukommelse!"
 20.  Ligeså tog han også Kalken efter Aftensmåltidet og sagde: "Denne
      Kalk er den nye Pagt i mit Blod, det, som udgydes for eder.
 21.  Men se, hans Hånd, som forråder mig, er her på Bordet hos mig.
 22.  Thi Menneskesønnen går bort, som det er beskikket; dog ve det
      Menneske, ved hvem han bliver forrådt!"
 23.  Og de begyndte at spørge hverandre indbyrdes om, hvem af dem det
      dog kunde være, som skulde gøre dette.

 24.  Men der opstod også en Trætte iblandt dem om, hvem at dem der
      måtte synes at være den største.
 25.  Men han sagde til dem: "Folkenes Konger herske over dem, og de,
      som bruge Myndighed over dem, kaldes deres Velgørere.
 26.  I derimod ikke således; men den ældste iblandt eder blive som
      den yngste, og Føreren som den, der tjener.
 27.  Thi hvem er størst: den, som sidder til Bords? eller den, som
      tjener? Mon ikke den, som sidder til Bords? Men jeg er iblandt
      eder som den, der tjener.
 28.  Men I ere de, som have holdt ud med mig i mine Fristelser.
 29.  Og ligesom min Fader har tildelt mig Kongedømme, tildeler jeg
      eder
 30.  at skulle spise og drikke ved mit Bord i mit Rige og sidde på
      Troner og dømme Israels tolv Stammer."
 31.  Men Herren sagde: "Simon, Simon! se, Satan begærede eder for at
      sigte eder som Hvede.
 32.  Men jeg bad for dig, at din Tro ikke skal svigte; og når du
      engang omvender dig, da styrk dine Brødre!"
 33.  Men han sagde til ham: "Herre! jeg er rede til at gå med dig
      både i Fængsel og i Døden."
 34.  Men han sagde: "Peter! jeg siger dig: Hanen skal ikke gale i
      Dag, førend du tre Gange har nægtet, at du kender mig."

 35.  Og han sagde til dem: "Da jeg udsendte eder uden Pung og Taske
      og Sko, manglede I da noget?" Og de sagde: "Intet."
 36.  Men han sagde til dem: "Men nu, den, som har en Pung, tage den
      med, ligeså også en Taske; og den, som ikke har noget Sværd,
      sælge sin Kappe og købe et!
 37.  Thi jeg siger eder: Det, som er skrevet, bør opfyldes på mig,
      dette: "Og han blev regnet iblandt Overtrædere;" thi også med
      mig har det en Ende."
 38.  Men de sagde: "Herre! se, her er to Sværd." Men han sagde til
      dem: "Det er nok."

 39.  Og han gik ud og gik efter sin Sædvane til Oliebjerget; men også
      Disciplene fulgte ham.
 40.  Men da han kom til Stedet, sagde han til dem: "Beder om ikke at
      falde i Fristelse."
 41.  Og han rev sig løs fra dem, så meget som et Stenkast, og faldt
      på Knæ, bad og sagde:
 42.  "Fader, vilde du dog tage denne Kalk fra mig! dog ske ikke min
      Villie, men din!"
 43.  Men en Engel fra Himmelen viste sig for ham og styrkede ham.
 44.  Og da han var i Dødsangst, bad han heftigere; men hans Sved blev
      som Blodsdråber, der faldt ned på Jorden.
 45.  Og da han stod op fra Bønnen og kom til Disciplene, fandt han
      dem sovende af Bedrøvelse.
 46.  Og han sagde til dem: "Hvorfor sove I? Står op og beder, for at
      I ikke skulle falde i Fristelse."

 47.  Medens han endnu talte, se, da kom der en Skare; og han, som hed
      Judas, en af de tolv, gik foran dem og nærmede sig til Jesus for
      at kysse ham.
 48.  Men Jesus sagde til ham: "Judas! forråder du Menneskesønnen med
      et Kys?"
 49.  Men da de,som vare omkring ham, så, hvad der vilde ske, sagde
      de: "Herre! skulle vi slå til med Sværd?"
 50.  Og en af dem slog Ypperstepræstens Tjener og afhuggede hans
      højre Øre.
 51.  Men Jesus tog til Orde og sagde: "Lad dem gøre også dette!" Og
      han rørte ved hans Øre og lægte ham.
 52.  Men Jesus sagde til Ypperstepræsterne og Høvedsmændene for
      Helligdommen og de ældste, som vare komne til ham: "I ere gåede
      ud som imod en Røver med Sværd og Knipler.
 53.  Da jeg var daglig hos eder i Helligdommen, udrakte I ikke
      Hænderne imod mig; men dette er eders Time og Mørkets Magt."

 54.  Og de grebe ham og førte ham bort og bragte ham ind i
      Ypperstepræstens Hus; men Peter fulgte efter i Frastand.
 55.  Og de tændte en Ild midt i Gården og satte sig sammen, og Peter
      sad midt iblandt dem.
 56.  Men en Pige så ham sidde i Lysskæret og stirrede på ham og
      sagde: "Også denne var med ham."
 57.  Men han fornægtede ham og sagde: "Jeg kender ham ikke. Kvinde!"
 58.  Og lidt derefter så en anden ham og sagde: "Også du er en af
      dem." Men Peter sagde: "Menneske! det er jeg ikke."
 59.  Og omtrent en Time derefter forsikrede en anden det og sagde: "I
      Sandhed, også denne var med ham; han er jo også en Galilæer."
 60.  Men Peter sagde: "Menneske! jeg forstår ikke, hvad du siger." Og
      straks, medens han endnu talte. galede Hanen.
 61.  Og Herren vendte sig og så på Peter; og Peter kom Herrens Ord i
      Hu, hvorledes han havde sagt til ham: "Førend Hanen galer i Dag,
      skal du fornægte mig tre Gange."
 62.  Og han gik udenfor og græd bitterligt.

 63.  Og de Mænd, som holdt Jesus, spottede ham og sloge ham;
 64.  og de kastede et Klæde over ham og spurgte ham og sagde:
      "Profeter! hvem var det, som slog dig?"
 65.  Og mange andre Ting sagde de spottende til ham.
 66.  Og da det blev Dag, samlede Folkets Ældste sig og
      Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge, og de førte ham hen for
      deres Råd
 67.  og sagde: "Er du Kristus, da sig os det!" Men han sagde til dem:
      "Siger jeg eder det, tro I det ikke.
 68.  Og om jeg spørger, svare I mig ikke, ej heller løslade I mig.
 69.  Men fra nu af skal Menneskesønnen sidde ved Guds Krafts højre
      Hånd."
 70.  Men de sagde alle: "Er du da Guds Søn?" Og han sagde til dem: "I
      sige det; jeg er det."
 71.  Men de sagde: "Hvad have vi længere Vidnesbyrd nødig? vi have jo
      selv hørt det af hans Mund!"

Lukas 23

  1.  Og hele Mængden stod op og førte ham for Pilatus.
  2.  Og de begyndte at anklage ham og sagde: "Vi have fundet, at
      denne vildleder vort Folk og forbyder at give Kejseren Skat og
      siger om sig selv at han er Kristus, en Konge."
  3.  Men Pilatus spurgte ham og sagde: "Er du Jødernes Konge?" Og han
      svarede og sagde til ham: "Du siger det."
  4.  Men Pilatus sagde til Ypperstepræsterne og til Skarerne: "Jeg
      finder ingen Skyld hos dette Menneske."
  5.  Men de bleve ivrigere og sagde: "Han oprører Folket, idet han
      lærer over hele Judæa fra Galilæa af, hvor han begyndte, og lige
      hertil."
  6.  Men da Pilatus hørte om Galilæa, spurgte han, om Manden var en
      Galilæer.
  7.  Og da han fik at vide, at han var fra Herodes's Område, sendte
      han ham til Herodes, som også selv var i Jerusalem i disse Dage.
  8.  Men da Herodes så Jesus, blev han meget glad; thi han havde i
      lang Tid gerne villet se ham, fordi han hørte om ham, og han
      håbede at se et Tegn blive gjort af ham.
  9.  Og han gjorde ham mange Spørgsmål; men han svarede ham intet.
 10.  Men Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge stode og anklagede ham
      heftigt.
 11.  Men da Herodes med sine Krigsfolk havde hånet og spottet ham,
      kastede han et prægtigt Klædebon om ham og sendte ham til
      Pilatus igen.
 12.  På den Dag bleve Herodes og Pilatus Venner med hinanden; thi de
      vare før i Fjendskab med hinanden.
 13.  Men Pilatus sammenkaldte Ypperstepræsterne og Rådsherrerne og
      Folket
 14.  og sagde til dem: "I have ført dette Menneske til mig som en,
      der forfører Folket til Frafald; og se. jeg har forhørt ham i
      eders Påhør og har ingen Skyld fundet hos dette Menneske i det,
      som I anklage ham for,
 15.  og Herodes ikke heller, thi han sendte ham tilbage fil os; og
      se, han har intet gjort som han er skyldig at dø for.
 16.  Derfor vil jeg revse ham og lade ham løs."
 17.  (Men han var nødt til at løslade dem een på Højtiden.)
 18.  Men de råbte alle sammen og sagde: "Bort med ham, men løslad os
      Barabbas!"
 19.  Denne var kastet i Fængsel for et Oprør, som var sket i Staden,
      og for Mord.
 20.  Og atter talte Pilatus til dem, da han gerne vilde løslade
      Jesus.
 21.  Men de råbte til ham og sagde: "Korsfæst, korsfæst ham!
 22.  Men han sagde tredje Gang til dem: "Hvad ondt har da denne gjort
      Jeg har ingen Dødsskyld fundet hos ham; derfor vil jeg revse ham
      og lade ham løs."
 23.  Men de trængte på med stærke Råb og forlangte, at han skulde
      korsfæstes; og deres Råb fik Overhånd.
 24.  Og Pilatus dømte, at deres Forlangende skulde opfyldes;
 25.  og han løslod den, de forlangte, som var kastet i Fængsel for
      Oprør og Mord; men Jesus overgav han til deres Villie.

 26.  Og da de førte ham bort, toge de fat på en vis Simon fra Kyrene,
      som kom fra Marken, og lagde Korset på ham, for at han skulde
      bære det bag efter Jesus.
 27.  Men der fulgte ham en stor Hob af Folket, og af Kvinder, som
      jamrede og græd over ham.
 28.  Men Jesus vendte sig om til dem og sagde: "I Jerusalems Døtre!
      græder ikke over mig, men græder over eder selv og over eders
      Børn!
 29.  Thi se, der kommer Dage, da man skal sige: Salige ere de
      ufrugtbare og de Liv, som ikke fødte, og de Bryster, som ikke
      gave Die.
 30.  Da skulle de begynde at sige til Bjergene: Falder over os! og
      til Højene: Skjuler os!
 31.  Thi gør man dette ved det grønne Træ, hvad vil da ske med det
      tørre?"
 32.  Men der blev også to andre Misdædere førte ud for at henrettes
      med ham.
 33.  Og da de vare komne til det Sted, som kaldes "Hovedskal",
      korsfæstede de ham der, og Misdæderne, den ene ved hans højre,
      og den anden ved hans venstre Side.
 34.  Men Jesus sagde: "Fader! forlad dem; thi de vide ikke, hvad de
      gøre." Men de delte hans Klæder imellem sig ved Lodkastning.
 35.  Og Folket stod og så til; men også Rådsherrerne spottede ham og
      sagde: "Andre har han frelst, lad ham frelse sig selv, dersom
      han er Guds Kristus, den udvalgte."
 36.  Men også Stridsmændene spottede ham, idet de trådte til, rakte
      ham Eddike og sagde:
 37.  "Dersom du er Jødernes Konge, da frels dig selv!"
 38.  Men der var også sat en Overskrift over ham (skreven på Græsk og
      Latin og Hebraisk): "Denne er Jødernes Konge."
 39.  Men en af de ophængte Misdædere spottede ham og sagde: "Er du
      ikke Kristus? Frels dig selv og os!"
 40.  Men den anden svarede og irettesatte ham og sagde: "Frygter
      heller ikke du Gud, da du er under den samme Dom?
 41.  Og vi ere det med Rette; thi vi få igen, hvad vore Gerninger
      have forskyldt; men denne gjorde intet uskikkeligt."
 42.  Og han sagde: "Jesus! kom mig i Hu, når du kommer i dit Rige!"
 43.  Og han sagde til ham: "Sandelig, siger jeg dig, i Dag skal du
      være med mig i Paradiset."
 44.  Og det var nu ved den sjette Time, og der blev Mørke over hele
      Landet indtil den niende Time,
 45.  idet Solen formørkedes; og Forhænget i Templet splittedes midt
      over.
 46.  Og Jesus råbte med høj Røst og sagde: "Fader! i dine Hænder
      befaler jeg min Ånd;" og da han havde sagt det, udåndede han.
 47.  Men da Høvedsmanden så det, som skete, gav han Gud Æren og
      sagde: "I Sandhed, dette Menneske var retfærdigt."
 48.  Og alle Skarerne, som vare komne sammen til dette Skue, sloge
      sig for Brystet, da de så, hvad der skete, og vendte tilbage.
 49.  Men alle hans Kyndinge stode langt borte, ligeså de Kvinder, som
      fulgte med ham fra Galilæa, og så dette.

 50.  Og se, en Mand ved Navn Josef, som var Rådsherre, en god og
      retfærdig Mand,
 51.  han havde ikke samtykket i deres Råd og Gerning, han var fra
      Arimathæa, en jødisk By, og han forventede Guds Rige;
 52.  han gik til Pilatus og bad om Jesu Legeme.
 53.  Og han tog det ned og svøbte det i et fint Linklæde, og han
      lagde ham i en Grav, som var hugget i en Klippe, hvor endnu
      ingen nogen Sinde var lagt. 54 Og det var Beredelsesdag, og
      Sabbaten stundede til.
 55.  Men Kvinderne, som vare komne med ham fra Galilæa, fulgte efter
      og så Graven, og hvorledes hans Legeme blev lagt.
 56.  Og de vendte tilbage og beredte vellugtende Urter og Salver; og
      Sabbaten over holdt de sig stille efter Budet.

Lukas 24

  1.  Men på den første Dag i Ugen meget årle kom de til Graven og
      bragte de vellugtende Urter, som de havde beredt.
  2.  Og de fandt Stenen bortvæltet fra Graven.
  3.  Men da de gik derind, fandt de ikke den Herres Jesu Legeme.
  4.  Og det skete, da de vare tvivlrådige om dette, se, da stode to
      Mænd for dem i strålende Klædebon.
  5.  Men da de bleve forfærdede og bøjede deres Ansigter imod Jorden,
      sagde de til dem: "Hvorfor lede I efter den levende iblandt de
      døde?
  6.  Han er ikke her, men han er opstanden; kommer i Hu, hvorledes
      han talte til eder, medens han endnu var i Galilæa, og sagde,
  7.  at Menneskesønnen burde overgives i syndige Menneskers Hænder og
      korsfæstes og opstå på den tredje Dag."
  8.  Og de kom hans Ord i Hu.
  9.  Og de vendte tilbage fra Graven og kundgjorde alle disse Ting
      for de elleve og for alle de andre.
 10.  Men det var Maria Magdalene og Johanna og Maria, Jakobs Moder,
      og de øvrige Kvinder med dem; de sagde Apostlene disse Ting.
 11.  Og disse Ord kom dem for som løs Tale; og de troede dem ikke.
 12.  Men Peter stod op og løb til Graven; og da han kiggede derind
      ser han Linklæderne alene liggende der, og han gik hjem i Undren
      over det, som var sket.

 13.  Og se, to af dem vandrede på den samme Dag til en Landsby, som
      lå tresindstyve Stadier fra Jerusalem, dens Navn var Emmaus.
 14.  Og de talte med hinanden om alle disse Ting, som vare skete.
 15.  Og det skete, medens de samtalede og spurgte hinanden indbyrdes,
      da kom Jesus selv nær og vandrede med dem.
 16.  Men deres Øjne holdtes til, så de ikke kendte ham.
 17.  Men han sagde til dem: "Hvad er dette for Ord, som I skifte med
      hinanden på Vejen?" Og de standsede bedrøvede.
 18.  Men en af dem, som hed Kleofas, svarede og sagde til ham: "Er du
      alene fremmed i Jerusalem og ved ikke, hvad der er sket der i
      disse dage?"
 19.  Og han sagde til dem: "Hvilket?" Men de sagde til ham: "Det med
      Jesus af Nazareth, som var en Profet, mægtig i Gerning og Ord
      for Gud og alt Folket;
 20.  og hvorledes Ypperstepræsterne og vore Rådsherrer have overgivet
      ham til Dødsdom og korsfæstet ham.
 21.  Men vi håbede, at han var den, som skulde forløse Israel. Men
      med alt dette er det i Dag den tredje Dag, siden dette skete.
 22.  Men også nogle af vore Kvinder have forfærdet os, idet de kom
      årle til Graven,
 23.  og da de ikke fandt hans Legeme, kom de og sagde, at de havde
      også set et Syn af Engle, der sagde, at han lever.
 24.  Og nogle af vore gik hen til Graven, og de fandt det således,
      som Kvinderne havde sagt; men ham så de ikke."
 25.  Og han sagde til dem: "O I uforstandige og senhjertede til at
      tro på alt det, som Profeterne have talt!
 26.  Burde ikke Kristus lide dette og indgå til sin Herlighed?"
 27.  Og han begyndte fra Moses og fra alle Profeterne og udlagde dem
      i alle Skrifterne det, som handlede om ham.
 28.  Og de nærmede sig til Landsbyen, som de gik til; og han lod, som
      han vilde gå videre.
 29.  Og de nødte ham meget og sagde: "Bliv hos os; thi det er mod
      Aften, og Dagen hælder." Og han gik ind for at blive hos dem.
 30.  Og det skete, da han havde sat sig med dem til Bords, tog han
      Brødet, velsignede og brød det og gav dem det.
 31.  Da bleve deres Øjne åbnede, og de kendte ham; og han blev
      usynlig for dem.
 32.  Og de sagde til hinanden: "Brændte ikke vort Hjerte i os, medens
      han talte til os på Vejen og oplod os Skrifterne?"
 33.  Og de stode op i den samme Time og vendte tilbage til Jerusalem
      og fandt forsamlede de elleve og dem, som vare med dem, hvilke
      sagde:
 34.  "Herren er virkelig opstanden og set af Simon."
 35.  Og de fortalte, hvad der var sket på Vejen, og hvorledes han
      blev kendt af dem, idet han brød Brødet.

 36.  Men medens de talte dette, stod han selv midt iblandt dem; og
      han siger til dem: "Fred være med eder!"
 37.  Da forskrækkedes de og betoges af Frygt og mente, at de så en
      Ånd.
 38.  Og han sagde til dem: "Hvorfor ere I forfærdede? og hvorfor
      opstiger der Tvivl i eders Hjerter?
 39.  Ser mine Hænder og mine Fødder, at det er mig selv; føler på mig
      og ser; thi en Ånd har ikke Kød og Ben, som I se, at jeg har."
 40.  Og da han havde sagt dette, viste han dem sine Hænder og sine
      Fødder.
 41.  Men da de af Glæde herover endnu ikke kunde tro og undrede sig,
      sagde han til dem: "Have I her noget at spise?"
 42.  Og de gave ham et Stykke af en stegt Fisk.
 43.  Og han tog det og spiste det for deres Øjne.
 44.  Men han sagde til dem: "Dette er mine Ord, som jeg talte til
      eder, medens jeg endnu var hos eder, at de Ting bør alle sammen
      opfyldes, som ere skrevne om mig i Mose Lov og Profeterne og
      Salmerne."
 45.  Da oplod han deres Forstand til at forstå Skrifterne.
 46.  Og han sagde til dem: "Således er der skrevet, at Kristus skulde
      lide og opstå fra de døde på den tredje Dag,
 47.  og at der i hans Navn skal prædikes Omvendelse og Syndernes
      Forladelse for alle Folkeslagene og begyndes fra Jerusalem.
 48.  I ere Vidner om disse Ting.
 49.  Og se, jeg sender min Faders Forjættelse over eder; men I skulle
      blive i Staden, indtil I blive iførte Kraft fra det høje."

 50.  Men han førte dem ud til hen imod Bethania, og han opløftede
      sine Hænder og velsignede dem.
 51.  Og det skete, idet han velsignede dem, skiltes han fra dem og
      opløftedes til Himmelen.
 52.  Og efter at have tilbedt ham vendte de tilbage til Jerusalem med
      stor Glæde.
 53.  Og de vare stedse i Helligdommen og priste Gud.


Johannes

Johannes 1

  1.  I Begyndelsen var Ordet, og Ordet var hos Gud, og Ordet var Gud.
  2.  Dette var i Begyndelsen hos Gud.
  3.  Alle Ting ere blevne til ved det, og uden det blev end ikke een
      Ting til af det, som er.
  4.  I det var Liv, og Livet var Menneskenes Lys.
  5.  Og Lyset skinner i Mørket, og Mørket begreb det ikke.
  6.  Der kom et Menneske, udsendt fra Gud, hans Navn var Johannes.
  7.  Denne kom til et Vidnesbyrd, for at han skulde vidne om Lyset,
      for at alle skulde tro ved ham.
  8.  Han var ikke Lyset, men han skulde vidne om Lyset.
  9.  Det sande Lys, der oplyser hvert Menneske, var ved at komme til
      Verden.
 10.  Han var i Verden, og Verden er bleven til ved ham, og Verden
      kendte ham ikke.
 11.  Han kom til sit eget, og hans egne toge ikke imod ham.
 12.  Men så mange, som toge imod ham, dem gav han Magt til at vorde
      Guds Børn, dem, som tro på hans Navn;
 13.  hvilke ikke bleve fødte af Blod, ej heller af Køds Villie, ej
      heller af Mands Villie, men af Gud.
 14.  Og Ordet blev Kød og tog Bolig iblandt os, og vi så hans
      Herlighed, en Herlighed, som en enbåren Søn har den fra sin
      Fader, fuld af Nåde og Sandhed.
 15.  Johannes vidner om ham og råber og siger: "Ham var det, om hvem
      jeg sagde: Den, som kommer efter mig, er kommen foran mig; thi
      han var før mig."
 16.  Thi af hans Fylde have vi alle modtaget, og det Nåde over Nåde.
 17.  Thi Loven blev given ved Moses; Nåden og Sandheden er kommen ved
      Jesus Kristus.
 18.  Ingen har nogen Sinde set Gud; den enbårne Søn, som er i
      Faderens Skød, han har kundgjort ham.

 19.  Og dette er Johannes's Vidnesbyrd, da Jøderne sendte Præster og
      Leviter ud fra Jerusalem, for at de skulde spørge ham: "Hvem er
      du?"
 20.  Og han bekendte og nægtede ikke, og han bekendte: "Jeg er ikke
      Kristus."
 21.  Og de spurgte ham: "Hvad da? Er du Elias?" Han siger: "Det er
      jeg ikke." "Er du Profeten?" Og han svarede: "Nej."
 22.  Da sagde de til ham: "Hvem er du? For at vi kunne give dem Svar,
      som have udsendt os; hvad siger du om dig selv?"
 23.  Han sagde: "Jeg er en Røst af en, som råber i Ørkenen: Jævner
      Herrens Vej, som Profeten Esajas har sagt."
 24.  Og de vare udsendte fra Farisæerne,
 25.  og de spurgte ham og sagde til ham: "Hvorfor døber du da, dersom
      du ikke er Kristus, ej heller Elias, ej heller Profeten?"
 26.  Johannes svarede dem og sagde: "Jeg døber med Vand; midt iblandt
      eder står den, I ikke kende,
 27.  han som kommer efter mig, hvis Skotvinge jeg ikke er værdig at
      løse."
 28.  Dette skete i Bethania hinsides Jordan, hvor Johannes døbte.
 29.  Den næste Dag ser han Jesus komme til sig, og han siger: "Se det
      Guds Lam, som bærer Verdens Synd!
 30.  Han er den, om hvem jeg sagde: Efter mig kommer en Mand, som er
      kommen foran mig; thi han var før mig.
 31.  Og jeg kendte ham ikke; men for at han skulde åbenbares for
      Israel, derfor er jeg kommen og døber med Vand."
 32.  Og Johannes vidnede og sagde: "Jeg har set Ånden dale ned som en
      Due fra Himmelen, og den blev over ham.
 33.  Og jeg kendte ham ikke; men den, som sendte mig for at døbe med
      Vand, han sagde til mig: Den, som du ser Ånden dale ned over og
      blive over, han er den, som døber med den Helligånd.
 34.  Og jeg har set det og har vidnet, at denne er Guds Søn."

 35.  Den næste Dag stod Johannes der atter og to af hans Disciple.
 36.  Og idet han så på Jesus,som gik der,siger han: "Se det Guds
      Lam!"
 37.  Og de to Disciple hørte ham tale, og de fulgte Jesus.
 38.  Men Jesus vendte sig om, og da han så dem følge sig, siger han
      til dem: "Hvad søge I efter?" Men de sagde til ham: "Rabbi!
      (hvilket udlagt betyder Mester) hvor opholder du dig?"
 39.  Han siger til dem: "Kommer og ser!" De kom da og så, hvor han
      opholdt sig, og de bleve hos ham den Dag; det var ved den Tiende
      Time.
 40.  Den ene af de to, som havde hørt Johannes's Ord og havde fulgt
      ham, var Andreas, Simon Peters Broder.
 41.  Denne finder først sin egen Broder Simon og siger til ham: "Vi
      have fundet Messias" (hvilket er udlagt: Kristus).
 42.  Og han førte ham til Jesus. Jesus så på ham og sagde: "Du er
      Simon, Johannes's Søn; du skal hedde Kefas" (det er udlagt:
      Petrus).
 43.  Den næste Dag vilde han drage derfra til Galilæa; og han finder
      Filip. Og Jesus siger til ham: "Følg mig!"
 44.  Men Filip var fra Bethsajda, fra Andreas's og Peters By.
 45.  Filip finder Nathanael og siger til ham: "Vi have fundet ham,
      hvem Moses i Loven og ligeså Profeterne have skrevet om, Jesus,
      Josefs Søn, fra Nazareth."
 46.  Og Nathanael sagde til ham: "Kan noget godt være fra Nazareth?"
      Filip siger til ham: "Kom og se!"
 47.  Jesus så Nathanael komme til sig, og han siger om ham: "Se, det
      er sandelig en Israelit, i hvem der ikke er Svig."
 48.  Nathanael siger til ham: "Hvorfra kender du mig?" Jesus svarede
      og sagde til ham: "Førend Filip kaldte dig, så jeg dig, medens
      du var under Figentræet."
 49.  Nathanael svarede ham: "Rabbi! du er Guds Søn, du er Israels
      Konge."
 50.  Jesus svarede og sagde til ham: "Tror du, fordi jeg sagde dig,
      at jeg så dig under Figentræet? Du skal se større Ting end
      disse."
 51.  Og han siger til ham: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, I
      skulle fra nu af se Himmelen åbnet og Guds Engle stige op og
      stige ned over Menneskesønnen."

Johannes 2

  1.  Og på den tredje Dag var der et Bryllup i Kana i Galilæa; og
      Jesu Moder var der.
  2.  Men også Jesus og hans Disciple bleve budne til Brylluppet.
  3.  Og da Vinen slap op, siger Jesu Moder til ham: "De have ikke
      Vin."
  4.  Jesus siger til hende: "Kvinde! hvad vil du mig? min Time er
      endnu ikke kommen."
  5.  Hans Moder siger til Tjenerne: "Hvad som han siger eder, det
      skulle I gøre."
  6.  Men der var der efter Jødernes Renselsesskik fremsat seks
      Vandkar af Sten, som rummede hvert to eller tre Spande.
  7.  Jesus siger til dem: "Fylder Vandkarrene med Vand; " og de
      fyldte dem indtil det øverste.
  8.  Og han siger til dem: "Øser nu og bærer til Køgemesteren; " og
      de bare det til ham.
  9.  Men da Køgemesteren smagte Vandet, som var blevet Vin, og ikke
      vidste, hvorfra det kom (men Tjenerne, som havde øst Vandet,
      vidste det), kalder Køgemesteren på Brudgommen og siger til ham:
 10.  "Hvert Menneske sætter først den gode Vin frem, og når de ere
      blevne drukne, da den ringere; du har gemt den gode Vin indtil
      nu."
 11.  Denne Begyndelse på sine Tegn gjorde Jesus i Kana i Galilæa, og
      han åbenbarede sin Herlighed; og hans Disciple troede på ham.

 12.  Derefter drog han ned til Kapernaum, han og hans Moder og hans
      Brødre og hans Disciple, og de bleve der ikke mange Dage.

 13.  Og Jødernes Påske var nær, og Jesus drog op til Jerusalem.
 14.  Og han fandt siddende i Helligdommen dem, som solgte Okser og
      Får og Duer, og Vekselerne.
 15.  Og han gjorde en Svøbe af Reb og drev dem alle ud af
      Helligdommen, både Fårene og Okserne, og han spredte
      Vekselerernes Småpenge og væltede Bordene.
 16.  Og han sagde til dem, som solgte duer: "Tager dette bort herfra;
      gører ikke min Faders Hus til en Købmandsbod!"
 17.  Hans Disciple kom i Hu, at der er skrevet: "Nidkærheden for dit
      Hus vil fortære mig."
 18.  Da svarede Jøderne og sagde til ham: "Hvad viser du os for et
      Tegn, efterdi du gør dette?"
 19.  Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Nedbryder dette Tempel, og i
      tre Dage vil jeg oprejse det."
 20.  Da sagde Jøderne: "I seks og fyrretyve År er der bygget på dette
      Tempel, og du vil oprejse det i tre Dage?"
 21.  Men han talte om sit Legemes Tempel.
 22.  Da han så var oprejst fra de døde, kom hans Disciple i Hu, at
      han havde sagt dette; og de troede Skriften og det Ord, som
      Jesus havde sagt.
 23.  Men da han var i Jerusalem i Påsken på Højtiden, troede mange på
      hans Navn, da de så hans Tegn, som han gjorde.
 24.  Men Jesus selv betroede sig ikke til dem, fordi han kendte alle,
 25.  og fordi han ikke havde nødig, at nogen skulde vidne om
      Mennesket; thi han vidste selv, hvad der var i Mennesket.

Johannes 3

  1.  Men der var en Mand af Farisæerne, han hed Nikodemus, en
      Rådsherre iblandt Jøderne.
  2.  Denne kom til ham om Natten og sagde til ham: "Rabbi! vi vide.
      at du er en Lærer kommen fra Gud; thi ingen kan gøre disse Tegn,
      som du gør, uden Gud er med ham."
  3.  Jesus svarede og sagde til ham: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg
      dig.  uden nogen bliver født på ny, kan han ikke se Guds Rige."
  4.  Nikodemus siger til ham: "Hvorledes kan et Menneske fødes, når
      han er gammel? Mon han kan anden Gang komme ind i sin Moders Liv
      og fødes?"
  5.  Jesus svarede: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg dig, uden nogen
      bliver født af Vand og Ånd, kan han ikke komme ind i Guds Rige.
  6.  Hvad der er født af Kødet, er Kød; og hvad der er født af Ånden,
      er Ånd.
  7.  Forundre dig ikke over, at jeg sagde til dig: I må fødes på ny.
  8.  Vinden blæser, hvorhen den vil, og du hører dens Susen, men du
      ved ikke, hvorfra den kommer, og hvor den farer hen; således er
      det med hver den, som er født af Ånden."
  9.  Nikodemus svarede og sagde til ham: "Hvorledes kan dette ske?"
 10.  Jesus svarede og sagde til ham: "Er du Israels Lærer og forstår
      ikke dette?
 11.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg dig vi tale det, vi vide, og vidne
      det, vi have set; og I modtage ikke vort Vidnesbyrd.
 12.  Når jeg siger eder de jordiske Ting, og I ikke tro, hvorledes
      skulle I da tro, når jeg siger eder de himmelske?
 13.  Og ingen er faren op til Himmelen, uden han, som for ned fra
      Himmelen, Menneskesønnen, som er i Himmelen.
 14.  Og ligesom Moses ophøjede Slangen i Ørkenen, således bør
      Menneskesønnen ophøjes,
 15.  for at hver den, som tror, skal have et evigt Liv i ham.
 16.  Thi således elskede Gud Verden, at han gav sin Søn den enbårne,
      for at hver den, som tror på ham, ikke skal fortabes, men have
      et evigt Liv.
 17.  Thi Gud sendte ikke sin Søn til Verden, for at han skal dømme
      Verden, men for at Verden skal frelses ved ham.
 18.  Den, som tror på ham, dømmes ikke; men den, som ikke tror, er
      allerede dømt, fordi han ikke har troet på Guds enbårne Søns
      Navn.
 19.  Og dette er Dommen, at Lyset er kommet til Verden, og Menneskene
      elskede Mørket mere end Lyset; thi deres Gerninger vare onde.
 20.  Thi hver den, som øver ondt, hader Lyset og kommer ikke til
      Lyset, for at hans Gerninger ikke skulle revses.
 21.  Men den, som gør Sandheden, kommer til Lyset, for at hans
      Gerninger må blive åbenbare; thi de ere gjorte i Gud."

 22.  Derefter kom Jesus og hans Disciple ud i Judæas Land, og han
      opholdt sig der med dem og døbte.
 23.  Men også Johannes døbte i Ænon, nær ved Salem, fordi der var
      meget Vand der; og man kom derhen og lod sig døbe.
 24.  Thi Johannes var endnu ikke kastet i Fængsel.
 25.  Da opkom der en Strid imellem Johannes's Disciple og en Jøde om
      Renselse.
 26.  Og de kom til Johannes og sagde til ham: "Rabbi! han, som var
      hos dig hinsides Jordan, han, hvem du gav Vidnesbyrd, se, han
      døber, og alle komme til ham."
 27.  Johannes svarede og sagde: "Et Menneske kan slet intet tage,
      uden det er ham givet fra Himmelen.
 28.  I ere selv mine Vidner på, at jeg sagde: Jeg er ikke Kristus,
      men jeg er udsendt foran ham.
 29.  Den, som har Bruden, er Brudgom; men Brudgommens Ven, som står
      og hører på ham, glæder sig meget over Brudgommens Røst. Så er
      da denne min Glæde bleven fuldkommen.
 30.  Han bør vokse, men jeg forringes.
 31.  Den, som kommer ovenfra, er over alle; den, som er af Jorden, er
      af Jorden og taler af Jorden; den, som kommer fra Himmelen, er
      over alle.
 32.  Og det, som han har set og hørt, vidner han; og ingen modtager
      hans Vidnesbyrd.
 33.  Den, som har modtaget hans Vidnesbyrd, har beseglet, at Gud er
      sanddru.
 34.  Thi han, hvem Gud udsendte, taler Guds Ord; Gud giver nemlig
      ikke Ånden efter Mål.
 35.  Faderen elsker Sønnen og har givet alle Ting i hans Hånd.
 36.  Den, som tror på Sønnen, har et evigt Liv; men den, som ikke vil
      tro Sønnen, skal ikke se Livet, men Guds Vrede bliver over ham."

Johannes 4

  1.  Da Herren nu erfarede, at Farisæerne havde hørt, at Jesus vandt
      flere Disciple og døbte flere end Johannes
  2.  (skønt Jesus ikke døbte selv, men hans Disciple):
  3.  da forlod han Judæa og drog atter bort til Galilæa.
  4.  Men han måtte rejse igennem Samaria.
  5.  Han kommer da til en By i Samaria, som kaldes Sykar, nær ved det
      Stykke Land, som Jakob gav sin Søn Josef.
  6.  Og der var Jakobs Brønd. Jesus satte sig da, træt af Rejsen, ned
      ved Brønden; det var ved den sjette Time.
  7.  En samaritansk Kvinde kommer for at drage Vand op. Jesus siger
      til hende: "Giv mig noget at drikke!"
  8.  Hans Disciple vare nemlig gåede bort til Byen for at købe Mad.
  9.  Da siger den samaritanske Kvinde til ham: "Hvorledes kan dog du,
      som er en Jøde, bede mig, som er en samaritansk Kvinde, om noget
      at drikke?" Thi Jøder holde ikke Samkvem med Samaritanere.
 10.  Jesus svarede og sagde til hende: "Dersom du kendte Guds Gave,
      og hvem det er, som siger til dig: Giv mig noget at drikke, da
      bad du ham, og han gav dig levende Vand."
 11.  Kvinden siger til ham: "Herre! du har jo intet at drage op med,
      og Brønden er dyb; hvorfra har du da det levende Vand?
 12.  Mon du er større end vor Fader Jakob, som har givet os Brønden,
      og han har selv drukket deraf og hans Børn og hans Kvæg?"
 13.  Jesus svarede og sagde til hende: "Hver den, som drikker af
      dette Vand, skal tørste igen.
 14.  Men den, som drikker af det Vand, som jeg giver ham, skal til
      evig Tid ikke tørste; men det Vand, som jeg giver ham, skal
      blive i ham en Kilde af Vand, som fremvælder til et evigt Liv."
 15.  Kvinden siger til ham: "Herre! giv mig dette Vand, for at jeg
      ikke skal tørste og ikke komme hid for at drage op."
 16.  Jesus siger til hende: "Gå bort, kald på din Mand, og kom hid!"
 17.  Kvinden svarede og sagde: "Jeg har ingen Mand." Jesus siger til
      hende: "Med Rette sagde du: Jeg har ingen Mand.
 18.  Thi du har haft fem Mænd; og han, som du nu har, er ikke din
      Mand.  Det har du sagt sandt."
 19.  Kvinden siger til ham: "Herre! jeg ser, at du er en Profet.
 20.  Vore Fædre have tilbedt på dette Bjerg, og I sige, at i
      Jerusalem er Stedet, hvor man bør tilbede."
 21.  Jesus siger til hende: "Tro mig, Kvinde, at den Time kommer, da
      det hverken skal være på dette Bjerg eller i Jerusalem, at I
      tilbede Faderen.
 22.  I tilbede det, I ikke kende; vi tilbede det, vi kende; thi
      Frelsen kommer fra Jøderne.
 23.  Men den Time kommer, ja, den er nu, da de sande Tilbedere skulle
      tilbede Faderen i Ånd og Sandhed; thi det er sådanne Tilbedere,
      Faderen vil have.
 24.  Gud er Ånd, og de, som tilbede ham, bør tilbede i Ånd og
      Sandhed."
 25.  Kvinden siger til ham: "Jeg ved, at Messias kommer (hvilket
      betyder Kristus); når han kommer, skal han kundgøre os alle
      Ting."
 26.  Jesus siger til hende: "Det er mig, jeg, som taler med dig."
 27.  Og i det samme kom hans Disciple, og de undrede sig over, at han
      talte med en Kvinde; dog sagde ingen: "Hvad søger du?" eller:
      "Hvorfor taler du med hende?"
 28.  Da lod Kvinden sin Vandkrukke stå og gik bort til Byen og siger
      til Menneskene der:
 29.  "Kommer og ser en Mand, som har sagt mig alt det, jeg har gjort;
      mon han skulde være Kristus?"
 30.  De gik ud af Byen og kom gående til ham.
 31.  Imidlertid bade Disciplene ham og sagde: "Rabbi, spis!"
 32.  Men han sagde til dem, jeg har Mad at spise, som I ikke kende."
 33.  Da sagde Disciplene til hverandre: "Mon nogen har bragt ham
      noget at spise?"
 34.  Jesus siger til dem: "Min Mad er, at jeg gør hans Villie, som
      udsendte mig, og fuldbyrder hans Gerning.
 35.  Sige I ikke: Der er endnu fire Måneder, så kommer Høsten? Se,
      jeg siger eder, opløfter eders Øjne og ser Markene; de ere
      allerede hvide til Høsten.
 36.  Den, som høster, får Løn og samler Frugt til et evigt Liv, så at
      de kunne glæde sig tilsammen, både den, som sår, og den, som
      høster.
 37.  Thi her er det Ord sandt: En sår, og en anden høster.
 38.  Jeg har udsendt eder at høste det, som I ikke have arbejdet på;
      andre have arbejdet, og I ere gåede ind i deres Arbejde."
 39.  Men mange af Samaritanerne fra den By troede på ham på Grund af
      Kvindens Ord, da hun vidnede: "Han har sagt mig alt det, jeg har
      gjort."
 40.  Da nu Samaritanerne kom til ham, bade de ham om at blive hos
      dem; og han blev der to Dage.
 41.  Og mange flere troede for hans Ords Skyld.
 42.  Og til Kvinden sagde de: "Vi tro nu ikke længer for din Tales
      Skyld; thi vi have selv hørt, og vi vide, at denne er sandelig
      Verdens Frelser."

 43.  Men efter de to Dage gik han derfra til Galilæa.
 44.  Thi Jesus vidnede selv, at en Profet ikke bliver æret i sit eget
      Fædreland.
 45.  Da han nu kom til Galilæa, toge Galilæerne imod ham, fordi de
      havde set alt det, som han gjorde i Jerusalem på Højtiden; thi
      også de vare komne til Højtiden.
 46.  Han kom da atter til Kana i Galilæa, hvor han havde gjort Vandet
      til Vin. Og der var en kongelig Embedsmand, hvis Søn lå syg i
      Kapernaum.
 47.  Da denne hørte, at Jesus var kommen fra Judæa til Galilæa, gik
      han til ham og bad om, at han vilde komme ned og helbrede hans
      Søn; thi han var Døden nær.
 48.  Da sagde Jesus til ham: "Dersom I ikke se Tegn og
      Undergerninger, ville I ikke tro."
 49.  Embedsmanden siger til ham: "Herre! kom, før mit Barn dør."
 50.  Jesus siger til ham: "Gå bort, din Søn lever." Og Manden troede
      det Ord, som Jesus sagde til ham, og gik bort.
 51.  Men allerede medens han var på Hjemvejen, mødte hans Tjenere ham
      og meldte, at hans Barn levede.
 52.  Da udspurgte han dem om den Time, i hvilken det var blevet bedre
      med ham; og de sagde til ham: "I Går ved den syvende time forlod
      Feberen ham."
 53.  Da skønnede Faderen, at det var sket i den Time, da Jesus sagde
      til ham: "Din Søn lever;" og han troede selv og hele hans Hus.
 54.  Dette var det andet Tegn, som Jesus gjorde, da han var kommen
      fra Judæa til Galilæa.

Johannes 5

  1.  Derefter var det Jødernes Højtid, og Jesus gik op til Jerusalem.
  2.  Men der er i Jerusalem ved Fåreporten en Dam, som på Hebraisk
      kaldes Bethesda, og den har fem Søjlegange.
  3.  I dem lå der en Mængde syge, blinde, lamme, visne, (som ventede
      på, at Vandet skulde røres.
  4.  Thi på visse Tider for en Engel ned i Dammen og oprørte Vandet.
      Den, som da, efter at Vandet var blevet oprørt, steg først ned,
      blev rask, hvilken Sygdom han end led af.)
  5.  Men der var en Mand, som havde været syg i otte og tredive År.
  6.  Da Jesus så ham ligge der og vidste, at han allerede havde
      ligget i lang Tid, sagde han til ham: "Vil du blive rask?"
  7.  Den syge svarede ham: "Herre! jeg har ingen, som kan bringe mig
      ned i Dammen, når Vandet bliver oprørt; men når jeg kommer,
      stiger en anden ned før mig."
  8.  Jesus siger til ham: "Stå op, tag din Seng og gå!"
  9.  Og straks blev Manden rask, og han tog sin Seng og gik. Men det
      var Sabbat på den Dag;
 10.  derfor sagde Jøderne til ham, som var bleven helbredt: "Det er
      Sabbat; og det er dig ikke tilladt af bære Sengen."
 11.  Han svarede dem: "Den, som gjorde mig rask, han sagde til mig:
      Tag din Seng og gå!"
 12.  Da spurgte de ham: "Hvem er det Menneske, som sagde til dig: Tag
      din Seng og gå?"
 13.  Men han; som var bleven helbredt, vidste ikke, hvem det var; thi
      Jesus havde unddraget sig, da der var mange Mennesker på Stedet.
 14.  Derefter finder Jesus ham i Helligdommen, og han sagde til ham:
      "Se, du er bleven rask; synd ikke mere, for at ikke noget værre
      skal times dig,!"
 15.  Manden gik bort og sagde til Jøderne, at det var Jesus, som
      havde gjort ham rask.
 16.  Og derfor forfulgte Jøderne Jesus, fordi han havde gjort dette
      på en Sabbat.
 17.  Men Jesus svarede dem: "Min Fader arbejder indtil nu; også jeg
      arbejder."
 18.  Derfor tragtede da Jøderne end mere efter at slå ham ihjel,
      fordi han ikke alene brød Sabbaten, men også kaldte Gud sin egen
      Fader og gjorde sig selv Gud lig.

 19.  Så svarede Jesus og sagde til dem: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger
      jeg eder, Sønnen kan slet intet gøre af sig selv, uden hvad han
      ser Faderen gøre; thi hvad han gør, det gør også Sønnen ligeså.
 20.  Thi Faderen elsker Sønnen og viser ham alt det, han selv gør, og
      han skal vise ham større Gerninger end disse, for at I skulle
      undre eder.
 21.  Thi ligesom Faderen oprejser de døde og gør levende, således gør
      også Sønnen levende, hvem han vil.
 22.  Thi heller ikke dømmer Faderen nogen, men har givet Sønnen hele
      Dommen,
 23.  for at alle skulle ære Sønnen, ligesom de ære Faderen. Den, som
      ikke ærer Sønnen, ærer ikke Faderen, som udsendte ham.
 24.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, den, som hører mit Ord og
      tror den, som sendte mig, har et evigt Liv og kommer ikke til
      Dom, men er gået over fra Døden til Livet.
 25.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, den Time kommer, ja den er
      nu, da de døde skulle høre Guds Søns Røst, og de, som høre den,
      skulle leve.
 26.  Thi ligesom Faderen har Liv i sig selv, således har han også
      givet Sønnen at have Liv i sig selv.
 27.  Og han har givet ham Magt til at holde Dom, efterdi han er
      Menneskesøn.
 28.  Undrer eder ikke herover; thi den Time kommer, på hvilken alle
      de, som ere i Gravene, skulle høre hans Røst,
 29.  og de skulle gå frem, de, som have gjort det gode, til Livets
      Opstandelse, men de, som have gjort det onde, til Dommens
      Opstandelse.
 30.  Jeg kan slet intet gøre af mig selv; således som jeg hører,
      dømmer jeg, og min Dom er retfærdig; thi jeg søger ikke min
      Villie, men hans Villie, som sendte mig.

 31.  Dersom jeg vidner om mig selv, er mit Vidnesbyrd ikke sandt".
 32.  Det er en anden, som vidner om mig, og jeg ved, at det
      Vidnesbyrd er sandt, som han vidner om mig.
 33.  I have sendt Bud til Johannes, og han har vidnet for sandheden.
 34.  Dog, jeg henter ikke Vidnesbyrdet fra et Menneske; men dette
      siger jeg, for at I skulle frelses.
 35.  Han var det brændende og skinnende Lys, og I have til en Tid
      villet fryde eder ved hans Lys.
 36.  Men det Vidnesbyrd, som jeg har, er større end Johannes's; thi
      de Gerninger, som Faderen har givet mig at fuldbyrde, selve de
      Gerninger, som jeg gør, vidne om mig, at Faderen har udsendt
      mig.
 37.  Og Faderen, som sendte mig, han har vidnet om mig. I have aldrig
      hverken hørt hans Røst eller set hans skikkelse,
 38.  og hans Ord have I ikke blivende i eder; thi den, som han
      udsendte, ham tro I ikke.
 39.  I ransage Skrifterne, fordi I mene i dem at have evigt Liv; og
      det er dem, som vidne om mig.
 40.  Og I ville ikke komme til mig, for at I kunne have Liv.
 41.  Jeg tager ikke Ære af Mennesker;
 42.  men jeg kender eder, at I have ikke Guds Kærlighed i eder.
 43.  Jeg er kommen i min Faders Navn, og I modtage mig ikke; dersom
      en anden kommer i sit eget Navn, ham ville I modtage.
 44.  Hvorledes kunne I tro,I, som tage Ære af hverandre, og den Ære,
      som er fra den eneste Gud, søge I ikke?
 45.  Tænker ikke, at jeg vil anklage eder for Faderen; der er en, som
      anklager eder, Moses, til hvem I have sat eders Håb.
 46.  Thi dersom I troede Moses. troede I mig; thi han har skrevet om
      mig,
 47.  Men tro I ikke hans Skrifter, hvorledes skulle I da tro mine
      Ord?"

Johannes 6

  1.  Derefter drog Jesus over til hin Side af Galilæas Sø,Tiberias
      Søen.
  2.  Og en stor Skare fulgte ham, fordi de så de Tegn, som han gjorde
      på de syge.
  3.  Men Jesus gik op på Bjerget og satte sig der med sine Disciple.
  4.  Men Påsken, Jødernes Højtid, var nær.
  5.  Da Jesus nu opløftede sine Øjne og så, at en stor Skare kom til
      ham, sagde han til Filip: "Hvor skulle vi købe Brød, for at
      disse kunne få noget at spise?"
  6.  Men dette sagde han for at prøve ham; thi han vidste selv, hvad
      han vilde gøre.
  7.  Filip svarede ham: "Brød for to Hundrede Denarer er ikke nok for
      dem, til at hver kan få noget lidet."
  8.  En af hans Disciple, Andreas, Simon Peters Broder, siger til
      ham:
  9.  "Her er en lille Dreng, som har fem Bygbrød og to Småfisk; men
      hvad er dette til så mange?"
 10.  Jesus sagde: "Lader Folkene sætte sig ned;" og der var meget
      Græs på Stedet. Da satte Mændene sig ned, omtrent fem Tusinde i
      Tallet.
 11.  Så tog Jesus Brødene og takkede og uddelte dem til dem, som
      havde sat sig ned; ligeledes også af Småfiskene så meget, de
      vilde.
 12.  Men da de vare blevne mætte, siger han til sine Disciple:
      "Samler de tiloversblevne Stykker sammen, for at intet skal gå
      til Spilde."
 13.  Da samlede de og fyldte tolv Kurve med Stykker, som bleve
      tilovers af de fem Bygbrød fra dem, som havde fået Mad.
 14.  Da nu Folkene så det Tegn, som han havde gjort, sagde de: "Denne
      er i Sandhed Profeten, som kommer til Verden."
 15.  Da Jesus nu skønnede, at de vilde komme og tage ham med Magt for
      at gøre ham til Konge, gik han atter op på Bjerget, ganske
      alene.

 16.  Men da det var blevet Aften, gik hans Disciple ned til Søen.
 17.  Og de gik om Bord i et Skib og vilde sætte over til hin Side af
      Søen til Kapernaum. Og det var allerede blevet mørkt, og Jesus
      var endnu ikke kommen til dem.
 18.  Og Søen rejste sig, da der blæste en stærk Vind.
 19.  Da de nu havde roet omtrent fem og tyve eller tredive Stadier,
      se de Jesus vandre på Søen og komme nær til Skibet, og de
      forfærdedes.
 20.  Men han siger til dem: "Det er mig; frygter ikke!"
 21.  Da vilde de tage ham op i Skibet; og straks kom Skibet til
      Landet, som de sejlede til.

 22.  Den næste dag så Skaren, som stod på hin Side af Søen, at der
      ikke havde været mere end eet Skib der, og at Jesus ikke var
      gået om Bord med sine Disciple, men at hans Disciple vare dragne
      bort alene,
 23.  (men der var kommet Skibe fra Tiberias nær til det Sted, hvor de
      spiste Brødet, efter at Herren havde gjort Taksigelse):
 24.  da Skaren nu så, at Jesus ikke var der, ej heller hans Disciple,
      gik de om Bord i Skibene og kom til Kapernaum for at søge efter
      Jesus.
 25.  Og da de fandt ham på hin Side af Søen, sagde de til ham:
      "Rabbi!  når er du kommen hid?"
 26.  Jesus svarede dem og sagde: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder,
      I søge mig, ikke fordi I så Tegn, men fordi I spiste af Brødene
      og bleve mætte.
 27.  Arbejder ikke for den Mad, som er forgængelig, men for den Mad,
      som varer til et evigt Liv, hvilken Menneskesønnen vil give
      eder; thi ham har Faderen, Gud selv, beseglet."
 28.  Da sagde de til ham: "Hvad skulle vi gøre, for at vi kunne
      arbejde på Guds Gerninger?"
 29.  Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Dette er Guds Gerning, at I tro
      på den, som han udsendte."
 30.  Da sagde de til ham: "Hvad gør du da for et Tegn, for at vi
      kunne se det og tro dig? Hvad Arbejde gør du?
 31.  Vore Fædre åde Manna i Ørkenen, som der er skrevet: Han gav dem
      Brød fra Himmelen at æde."
 32.  Da sagde Jesus til dem: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder,
      ikke Moses har givet eder Brødet fra Himmelen, men min Fader
      giver eder det sande Brød fra Himmelen.
 33.  Thi Guds Brød er det, som kommer ned fra Himmelen og giver
      Verden Liv."
 34.  Da sagde de til ham: "Herre! giv os altid dette Brød!"
 35.  Jesus sagde til dem: "Jeg er Livets Brød. Den, som kommer til
      mig, skal ikke hungre; og den, som tror på mig, skal aldrig
      tørste.
 36.  Men jeg har sagt eder, at I have set mig og dog ikke tro.
 37.  Alt, hvad Faderen giver mig, skal komme til mig; og den, som
      kommer til mig, vil jeg ingenlunde kaste ud.
 38.  Thi jeg er kommen ned fra Himmelen, ikke for at gøre min Villie,
      men hans Villie, som sendte mig.
 39.  Men dette er hans Villie, som sendte mig, at jeg skal intet
      miste af alt det, som han har givet mig, men jeg skal oprejse
      det på den yderste Dag.
 40.  Thi dette er min Faders Villie, at hver den, som ser Sønnen og
      tror på ham, skal have et evigt Liv, og jeg skal oprejse ham på
      den yderste Dag."
 41.  Da knurrede Jøderne over ham, fordi han sagde: "Jeg er det Brød,
      som kom ned fra Himmelen,"
 42.  og de sagde: "Er dette ikke Jesus, Josefs Søn, hvis Fader og
      Moder vi kende? Hvorledes kan han da sige: Jeg er kommen ned fra
      Himmelen?"
 43.  Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Knurrer ikke indbyrdes!
 44.  Ingen kan komme til mig, uden Faderen, som sendte mig, drager
      ham; og jeg skal oprejse ham på den yderste Dag.
 45.  Der er skrevet hos Profeterne: "Og de skulle alle være oplærte
      af Gud." Hver den, som har hørt af Faderen og lært, kommer til
      mig.
 46.  Ikke at nogen har set Faderen, kun den, som er fra Gud, han har
      set Faderen.
 47.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, den, som tror på mig, har et
      evigt Liv.
 48.  Jeg er Livets Brød.
 49.  Eders Fædre åde Manna i Ørkenen og døde.
 50.  Dette er det Brød, som kommer ned fra Himmelen, at man skal æde
      af det og ikke dø.
 51.  Jeg er det levende Brød, som kom ned fra Himmelen; om nogen æder
      af dette Brød, han skal leve til evig Tid; og det Brød, som jeg
      vil give, er mit Kød, hvilket jeg vil give for Verdens Liv."
 52.  Da kivedes Jøderne indbyrdes og sagde: "Hvorledes kan han give
      os sit Kød at æde?"
 53.  Jesus sagde da til dem: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder,
      dersom I ikke æde Menneskesønnens Kød og drikke hans Blod, have
      I ikke Liv i eder.
 54.  Den, som æder mit Kød og drikker mit Blod, har et evigt Liv, og
      jeg skal oprejse ham på den yderste Dag.
 55.  Thi mit Kød er sand Mad, og mit Blod er sand Drikke.
 56.  Den, som æder mit Kød og drikker mit Blod, han bliver i mig, og
      jeg i ham.
 57.  Ligesom den levende Fader udsendte mig, og jeg lever i Kraft af
      Faderen, ligeså skal også den, som æder mig, leve i Kraft af
      mig.
 58.  dette er det Brød, som er kommet ned fra Himmelen; ikke som
      eders Fædre åde og døde. Den, som æder dette Brød, skal leve
      evindelig."
 59.  Dette sagde han, da han lærte i en Synagoge i Kapernaum.

 60.  Da sagde mange af hans Disciple, som havde hørt ham: "Dette er
      en hård Tale; hvem kan høre den?"
 61.  Men da Jesus vidste hos sig selv, at hans Disciple knurrede
      derover, sagde han til dem: "Forarger dette eder?
 62.  Hvad om I da få at se, at Menneskesønnen farer op, hvor han var
      før?
 63.  Det er Ånden, som levendegør, Kødet gavner intet; de Ord, som
      jeg har talt til eder, ere Ånd og ere Liv.
 64.  Men der er nogle af eder, som ikke tro." Thi Jesus vidste fra
      Begyndelsen, hvem det var, der ikke troede, og hvem den var, der
      skulde forråde ham.
 65.  Og han sagde: "Derfor har jeg sagt eder, at ingen kan komme til
      mig, uden det er givet ham af Faderen."
 66.  Fra den Tid trådte mange af hans Disciple tilbage og vandrede
      ikke mere med ham.
 67.  Jesus sagde da til de tolv: "Mon også I ville gå bort?"
 68.  Simon Peter svarede ham: "Herre! til hvem skulle vi gå hen? Du
      har det evige Livs Ord;
 69.  og vi have troet og erkendt, at du er Guds Hellige."
 70.  Jesus svarede dem: "Har jeg ikke udvalgt mig eder tolv, og en af
      eder er en Djævel?"
 71.  Men han talte om Judas, Simon Iskariots Søn; thi det var ham,
      som siden skulde forråde ham, skønt han var en af de tolv.

Johannes 7

  1.  Derefter vandrede Jesus omkring i Galilæa; thi han vilde ikke
      vandre i Judæa, fordi Jøderne søgte at slå ham ihjel.
  2.  Men Jødernes Højtid, Løvsalsfesten, var nær.
  3.  Da sagde hans Brødre til ham: "Drag bort herfra og gå til Judæa,
      for at også dine Disciple kunne se dine Gerninger, som du gør.
  4.  Thi ingen gør noget i Løndom, når han selv ønsker at være
      åbenbar; dersom du gør dette, da vis dig for Verden!"
  5.  Thi heller ikke hans Brødre troede på ham.
  6.  Da siger Jesus til dem: "Min Tid er endnu ikke kommen; men eders
      Tid er stedse for Hånden.
  7.  Verden kan ikke hade eder; men mig hader den, fordi jeg vidner
      om den, at dens Gerninger ere onde.
  8.  Drager I op til Højtiden; jeg drager endnu ikke op til denne
      Højtid, thi min Tid er endnu ikke fuldkommet."
  9.  Da han havde sagt dette til dem, blev han i Galilæa.
 10.  Men da hans Brødre vare dragne op til Højtiden, da drog han også
      selv op, ikke åbenlyst, men lønligt.

 11.  Da ledte Jøderne efter ham på Højtiden og sagde: "Hvor er han?"
 12.  Og der blev mumlet meget om ham iblandt Skarerne; nogle sagde:
      "Han er en god Mand;" men andre sagde: "Nej, han forfører
      Mængden."
 13.  Dog talte ingen frit om ham af Frygt for Jøderne.

 14.  Men da det allerede var midt i Højtiden. gik Jesus op i
      Helligdommen og lærte.
 15.  Jøderne undrede sig nu og sagde: "Hvorledes kan denne have
      Lærdom, da han ikke er oplært?"
 16.  Da svarede Jesus dem og sagde: "Min Lære er ikke min, men hans,
      som sendte mig.
 17.  Dersom nogen vil gøre hans Villie, skal han erkende, om Læren er
      fra Gud, eller jeg taler af mig selv.
 18.  Den, der taler af sig selv, søger sin egen Ære; men den, som
      søger hans Ære, der sendte ham, han er sanddru, og der er ikke
      Uret i ham.
 19.  Har ikke Moses givet eder Loven? Og ingen af eder holder Loven.
      Hvorfor søge I at slå mig ihjel?"
 20.  Mængden svarede: "Du er besat; hvem søger at slå dig ihjel?"
 21.  Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Een Gerning gjorde jeg, og I
      undre eder alle derover.
 22.  Moses har givet eder Omskærelsen, (ikke at den er fra Moses, men
      fra Fædrene) og I omskære et Menneske på en Sabbat.
 23.  Dersom et Menneske får Omskærelse på en Sabbat, for at Mose Lov
      ikke skal brydes, ere I da vrede på mig, fordi jeg har gjort et
      helt Menneske rask på en Sabbat?
 24.  Dømmer ikke efter Skinnet, men dømmer en retfærdig Dom!"

 25.  Da sagde nogle af dem fra Jerusalem: "Er det ikke ham, som de
      søge at slå ihjel?
 26.  Og se, han taler frit, og de sige intet til ham; mon
      Rådsherrerne virkelig skulde have erkendt, at han er Kristus?
 27.  Dog vi vide, hvorfra denne er; men når Kristus kommer, kender
      ingen, hvorfra han er."
 28.  Derfor råbte Jesus, idet han lærte i Helligdommen, og sagde:
      "Både kende I mig og vide, hvorfra jeg er! Og af mig selv er jeg
      ikke kommen, men han, som sendte mig, er sand, han, hvem I ikke
      kende.
 29.  Jeg kender ham; thi jeg er fra ham, og han har udsendt mig."
 30.  De søgte da at gribe ham; og ingen lagde Hånd på ham, thi hans
      Time var endnu ikke kommen.
 31.  Men mange af Folket troede på ham, og de sagde: "Når Kristus
      kommer, mon han da skal gøre flere Tegn, end denne har gjort?"

 32.  Farisæerne hørte, at Mængden mumlede dette om ham; og
      Ypperstepræsterne og Farisæerne sendte Tjenere ud for at gribe
      ham.
 33.  Da sagde Jesus: "Endnu en liden Tid er jeg hos eder, så går jeg
      bort til den, som sendte mig.
 34.  I skulle lede efter mig og ikke finde mig, og der, hvor jeg er,
      kunne I ikke komme."
 35.  Da sagde Jøderne til hverandre: "Hvor vil han gå hen, siden vi
      ikke skulle finde ham? Mon han vil gå til dem, som ere adspredte
      iblandt Grækerne, og lære Grækerne?
 36.  Hvad er det for et Ord, han siger: I skulle lede efter mig og
      ikke finde mig, og der, hvor jeg er, kunne I ikke komme?"
 37.  Men på den sidste, den store Højtidsdag stod Jesus og råbte og
      sagde: "Om nogen tørster,han komme til mig og drikke!
 38.  Den, som tror på mig, af hans Liv skal der, som Skriften har
      sagt, flyde levende Vandstrømme:"
 39.  Men dette sagde han om den Ånd, som de, der troede på ham,
      skulde få; thi den Helligånd var der ikke endnu, fordi Jesus
      endnu ikke var herliggjort.

 40.  Nogle af Mængden, som hørte disse Ord, sagde nu: "Dette er
      sandelig Profeten."
 41.  Andre sagde: "Dette er Kristus;" men andre sagde: "Mon da
      Kristus kommer fra Galilæa?
 42.  Har ikke Skriften sagt, at Kristus kommer af Davids Sæd og fra
      Bethlehem, den Landsby, hvor David var?"
 43.  Således blev der Splid iblandt Mængden om ham.
 44.  Men nogle af dem vilde gribe ham; dog lagde ingen Hånd på ham.

 45.  Tjenerne kom nu til Ypperstepræsterne og Farisæerne, og disse
      sagde til dem: "Hvorfor have I ikke ført ham herhen?"
 46.  Tjenerne svarede: "Aldrig har noget Menneske talt således som
      dette Menneske."
 47.  Da svarede Farisæerne dem: "Ere også I forførte?
 48.  Mon nogen af Rådsherrerne har troet på ham, eller nogen af
      Farisæerne?
 49.  Men denne Hob, som ikke kender Loven, er forbandet."
 50.  Nikodemus, han, som var kommen til ham om Natten og var en af
      dem, sagde til dem:
 51.  "Mon vor Lov dømmer et Menneske, uden at man først forhører ham
      og får at vide, hvad han gør?"
 52.  De svarede og sagde til ham: "Er også du fra Galilæa? Ransag og
      se, at der ikke fremstår nogen Profet fra Galilæa."

Johannes 8

  1.  Og de gik hver til sit Hus. Men Jesus gik til Oliebjerget.
  2.  og årle om Morgenen kom han igen i Helligdommen, og hele Folket
      kom til ham; og han satte sig og lærte dem.
  3.  Men de skriftkloge og Farisæerne føre en Kvinde til ham, greben
      i Hor, og stille hende frem i Midten.
  4.  Og de sige til ham: "Mester! denne Kvinde er greben i Hor på
      fersk Gerning.
  5.  Men Moses bød os i Loven, at sådanne skulle stenes; hvad siger
      nu du?"
  6.  Men dette sagde de for at friste ham, for at de kunde have noget
      at anklage ham for. Men Jesus bøjede sig ned og skrev med
      Fingeren på Jorden.
  7.  Men da de bleve ved at spørge ham, rettede han sig op og sagde
      til dem: "Den iblandt eder, som er uden Synd, kaste først Stenen
      på hende!"
  8.  Og han bøjede sig atter ned og skrev på Jorden.
  9.  Men da de hørte det, gik de bort, den ene efter den anden, fra
      de ældste til de yngste, og Jesus blev alene tilbage med
      Kvinden, som stod der i Midten.
 10.  Men da Jesus rettede sig op og ingen så uden Kvinden, sagde han
      til hende: "Kvinde! hvor ere de henne? Var der ingen, som
      fordømte dig?,"
 11.  Men hun sagde: "Herre! ingen." Da sagde Jesus: "Heller ikke jeg
      fordømmer dig; gå bort, og synd ikke mere!"

 12.  Jesus talte da atter til dem og sagde: "Jeg er Verdens Lys; den,
      som følger mig, skal ikke vandre i Mørket, men have Livets Lys."
 13.  Da sagde Farisæerne til ham: "Du vidner om dig selv; dit
      Vidnesbyrd er ikke sandt."
 14.  Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Om jeg end vidner om mig
      selv. er mit Vidnesbyrd sandt; thi jeg ved, hvorfra jeg kom, og
      hvor jeg går hen; men I vide ikke, hvorfra jeg kommer, og hvor
      jeg går hen.
 15.  I dømme efter Kødet; jeg dømmer ingen.
 16.  Men om jeg også dømmer, er min Dom sand; thi det er ikke mig
      alene, men mig og Faderen, han, som sendte mig.
 17.  Men også i eders Lov er der skrevet, at to Menneskers Vidnesbyrd
      er sandt.
 18.  Jeg er den, der vidner om mig selv, og Faderen, som sendte mig,
      vidner om mig."
 19.  Derfor sagde de til ham: "Hvor er din Fader?" Jesus svarede: "I
      kende hverken mig eller min Fader; dersom I kendte mig, kendte I
      også min Fader."
 20.  Disse Ord talte Jesus ved Tempelblokken, da han lærte i
      Helligdommen; og ingen greb ham, fordi hans Time endnu ikke var
      kommen.
 21.  Da sagde han atter til dem: "Jeg går bort, og I skulle lede
      efter mig, og I skulle dø i eders Synd; hvor jeg går hen, kunne
      I ikke komme."
 22.  Da sagde Jøderne: "Mon han vil slå sig selv ihjel, siden han
      siger: Hvor jeg går hen, kunne I ikke komme?"
 23.  Og han sagde til dem: "I ere nedenfra, jeg er ovenfra; I ere af
      denne Verden, jeg er ikke af denne Verden.
 24.  Derfor har jeg sagt eder, at I skulle dø i eders Synder; thi
      dersom I ikke tro, at det er mig, skulle I dø i eders Synder."
 25.  De sagde da til ham: "Hvem er du?" Og Jesus sagde til dem: "Just
      det, som jeg siger eder.
 26.  Jeg har meget at tale og dømme om eder; men den, som sendte mig,
      er sanddru, og hvad jeg har hørt af ham, det taler jeg til
      Verden."
 27.  De forstode ikke, at han talte til dem om Faderen.
 28.  Da sagde Jesus til dem: "Når I få ophøjet Menneskesønnen, da
      skulle I kende, at det er mig, og at jeg gør intet af mig selv;
      men som min Fader har lært mig, således taler jeg.
 29.  Og han, som sendte mig, er med mig; han har ikke ladet mig
      alene, fordi jeg; gør altid det, som er ham til Behag."

 30.  Da han talte dette, troede mange på ham.
 31.  Jesus sagde da til de Jøder, som vare komne til Tro på ham:
      "Dersom I blive i mit Ord, ere I sandelig mine Disciple,
 32.  og I skulle erkende Sandheden, og Sandheden skal frigøre eder."
 33.  De svarede ham: "Vi ere Abrahams Sæd og have aldrig været nogens
      Trælle; hvorledes siger du da: I skulle vorde frie?"
 34.  Jesus svarede dem: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, hver
      den, som gør Synden, er Syndens Træl.
 35.  Men Trællen bliver ikke i Huset til evig Tid, Sønnen bliver der
      til evig Tid.
 36.  Dersom da Sønnen får frigjort eder, skulle I være virkelig frie.
 37.  Jeg ved, at I ere Abrahams Sæd; men I søge at slå mig ihjel,
      fordi min Tale ikke finder Rum hos eder.
 38.  Jeg taler det, som jeg har set hos min Fader; så gøre også I
      det, som I have hørt af eders Fader."
 39.  De svarede og sagde til ham: "Vor Fader er Abraham." Jesus sagde
      til dem: "Dersom I vare Abrahams Børn, gjorde I Abrahams
      Gerninger.
 40.  Men nu søge I at slå mig ihjel, et Menneske, der har sagt eder
      Sandheden, som jeg har hørt af Gud; dette gjorde Abraham ikke.
 41.  I gøre eders Faders Gerninger." De sagde til ham: "Vi ere ikke
      avlede i Hor; vi have een Fader, Gud."
 42.  Jesus sagde til dem: "Dersom Gud var eders Fader, da elskede I
      mig; thi jeg er udgået og kommen fra Gud; thi jeg er heller ikke
      kommen af mig selv, men han har udsendt mig.
 43.  Hvorfor forstå I ikke min Tale? fordi I ikke kunne høre mit Ord.
 44.  I ere af den Fader Djævelen, og eders Faders Begæringer ville I
      gøre. Han var en Manddraber fra Begyndelsen af, og han står ikke
      i Sandheden; thi Sandhed er ikke i ham. Når han taler Løgn,
      taler han af sit eget; thi han er en Løgner og Løgnens Fader.
 45.  Men mig tro I ikke, fordi jeg siger Sandheden.
 46.  Hvem af eder kan overbevise mig om nogen Synd? Siger jeg
      Sandhed, hvorfor tro I mig da ikke?
 47.  Den, som er af Gud, hører Guds Ord; derfor høre I ikke, fordi I
      ere ikke af Gud."
 48.  Jøderne svarede og sagde til ham: "Sige vi ikke med Rette, at du
      er en Samaritan og er besat?"
 49.  Jesus svarede: "Jeg er ikke besat, men jeg ærer min Fader, og I
      vanære mig.
 50.  Men jeg søger ikke min Ære; der er den, som søger den og dømmer.
 51.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, dersom nogen holder mit Ord,
      skal han i al Evighed ikke se Døden."
 52.  Jøderne sagde til ham: "Nu vide vi, at du et besat; Abraham døde
      og Profeterne, og du siger: Dersom nogen holder mit Ord, han
      skal i al Evighed ikke smage Døden.
 53.  Mon du er større end vor Fader Abraham, som jo døde? også
      Profeterne døde; hvem gør du dig selv til?"
 54.  Jesus svarede: "Dersom jeg ærer mig selv, er min Ære intet; det
      er min Fader, som ærer mig, han, om hvem I sige, at han er eders
      Gud.
 55.  Og I have ikke kendt ham, men jeg kender ham. Og dersom jeg
      siger: "Jeg kender ham ikke," da bliver jeg en Løgner ligesom I;
      men jeg kender ham og holder hans Ord.
 56.  Abraham, eders Fader, frydede sig til at se min Dag, og han så
      den og glædede sig."
 57.  Da sagde Jøderne til ham: "Du er endnu ikke halvtredsindstyve År
      gammel, og du har set Abraham?"
 58.  Jesus sagde til dem: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, førend
      Abraham blev til, har jeg været."
 59.  Så toge de Sten for at kaste på ham; men Jesus skjulte sig og
      gik ud af Helligdommen.

Johannes 9

  1.  Og da han gik forbi så han et Menneske, som var blindt fra
      Fødselen.
  2.  Og hans Disciple spurgte ham og sagde: "Rabbi, hvem har syndet,
      denne eller hans Forældre, så han skulde fødes blind?"
  3.  Jesus svarede: "Hverken han eller hans Forældre have syndet; men
      det er sket, for at Guds Gerninger skulle åbenbares på ham.
  4.  Jeg må gøre hans Gerninger, som sendte mig, så længe det er Dag;
      der kommer en Nat, da ingen kan arbejde.
  5.  Medens jeg er i Verden, er jeg Verdens Lys."
  6.  Da han havde sagt dette, spyttede han på Jorden og gjorde Dynd
      af Spyttet og smurte Dyndet på hans Øjne.
  7.  Og han sagde til ham: "Gå hen, to dig i Dammen Siloam" (hvilket
      er udlagt: udsendt). Da gik han bort og toede sig, og han kom
      seende tilbage.
  8.  Da sagde Naboerne og de, som før vare vante til at se ham som
      Tigger: "Er det ikke ham, som sad og tiggede?"
  9.  Nogle sagde: "Det er ham;" men andre sagde: "Nej, han ligner
      ham."  Han selv sagde: "Det er mig."
 10.  Da sagde de til ham: "Hvorledes bleve dine Øjne åbnede?"
 11.  Han svarede: "En Mand, som kaldes Jesus, gjorde Dynd og smurte
      det på mine Øjne og sagde til mig: Gå hen til Siloam og to dig!
      Da jeg så gik hen og toede mig, blev jeg seende."
 12.  Da sagde de til ham: "Hvor er han?" Han siger: "Det ved jeg
      ikke."
 13.  De føre ham, som før var blind, til Farisæerne.
 14.  Men det var Sabbat den Dag, da Jesus gjorde Dyndet og åbnede
      hans Øjne.
 15.  Atter spurgte nu også Farisæerne ham, hvorledes han var bleven
      seende. Men han sagde til dem: "Han lagde Dynd på mine Øjne, og
      jeg toede mig, og nu ser jeg."
 16.  Nogle af Farisæerne sagde da: "Dette Menneske er ikke fra Gud,
      efterdi han ikke holder Sabbaten." Andre sagde: "Hvorledes kan
      et syndigt Menneske gøre sådanne Tegn?" Og der var Splid imellem
      dem.
 17.  de sige da atter til den blinde: "Hvad siger du om ham, efterdi
      han åbnede dine Øjne?" Men han sagde: "Han er en Profet."
 18.  Så troede Jøderne ikke om ham, at han havde været blind og var
      bleven seende, førend de fik kaldt på Forældrene til ham, som
      havde fået sit Syn.
 19.  Og de spurgte dem og sagde: "Er denne eders Søn, om hvem I sige,
      at han var født blind? Hvorledes er han da nu seende?"
 20.  Hans Forældre svarede dem og sagde; "Vi vide, at denne er vor
      Søn, og at han, var født blind.
 21.  Men hvorledes han nu er bleven seende, vide vi ikke, og hvem der
      har åbnet hans Øjne, vide vi ikke heller; spørger ham; han er
      gammel nok; han må selv tale for sig."
 22.  Dette sagde hans Forældre, fordi de frygtede for Jøderne; thi
      Jøderne vare allerede komne overens om, at dersom nogen bekendte
      ham som Kristus, skulde han udelukkes af Synagogen.
 23.  Derfor sagde hans Forældre: "Han er gammel nok, spørger ham
      selv!"
 24.  Da hidkaldte de anden Gang Manden, som havde været blind, og
      sagde til ham: "Giv Gud Æren; vi vide, at dette Menneske er en
      Synder."
 25.  Da svarede han: "Om han er en Synder, ved jeg ikke; een Ting ved
      jeg, at jeg, som var blind, nu ser."
 26.  De sagde da til ham igen: "Hvad gjorde han ved dig? Hvorledes
      åbnede han dine Øjne?"
 27.  Han svarede dem: "Jeg har allerede sagt eder det, og I hørte
      ikke efter. Hvorfor ville I høre det igen? Ville også I blive
      hans Disciple?"
 28.  Da udskældte de ham og sagde: "Du er hans Discipel; men vi ere
      Mose Disciple.
 29.  Vi vide, at Gud har talt til Moses; men om denne vide vi ikke.
      hvorfra han er."
 30.  Manden svarede og sagde til dem: "Det er dog underligt, at I
      ikke vide, hvorfra han er, og han har åbnet mine Øjne.
 31.  Vi vide, at Syndere bønhører Gud ikke; men dersom nogen er
      gudfrygtig og gør hans Villie, ham hører han.
 32.  Aldrig er det hørt, at nogen har åbnet Øjnene på en blindfødt.
 33.  Var denne ikke fra Gud, da kunde han intet gøre."
 34.  De svarede og sagde til ham: "Du er hel og holden født i Synder,
      og du vil lære os?" Og de stødte ham ud.
 35.  Jesus hørte, at de havde udstødt ham; og da han traf ham sagde
      han til ham: "Tror du på Guds Søn?"
 36.  Han svarede og sagde: "Hvem er han, Herre? for at jeg kan tro på
      ham."
 37.  Jesus sagde til ham: "Både har du set ham, og den, som taler med
      dig, ham er det."
 38.  Men han sagde: "Jeg tror Herre!" og han kastede sig ned for ham.
 39.  Og Jesus sagde: "Til Dom er jeg kommen til denne Verden, for at
      de, som ikke se, skulle blive seende, og de, som se, skulle
      blive blinde."
 40.  Nogle af Farisæerne, som vare hos. ham, hørte dette, og de sagde
      til ham: "Mon også vi ere blinde?"
 41.  Jesus sagde til dem: "Vare I blinde, da havde I ikke Synd; men
      nu sige I: Vi se; eders Synd forbliver."

Johannes 10

  1.  " Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, den, som ikke går ind i
      Fårefolden gennem Døren, men stiger andensteds over, han er en
      Tyv og en Røver.
  2.  Men den, som går ind igennem Døren, er Fårenes Hyrde.
  3.  For ham lukker Dørvogteren op, og Fårene høre hans Røst; og han
      kalder sine egne Får ved Navn og fører dem ud.
  4.  Og når han har ført alle sine egne Får ud, går han foran dem; og
      Fårene følge ham, fordi de kende hans Røst.
  5.  Men en fremmed ville de ikke følge, men de ville fly fra ham,
      fordi de ikke kende de fremmedes Røst."
  6.  Denne Lignelse sagde Jesus til dem; men de forstode ikke, hvad
      det var, som han talte til dem.
  7.  Jesus sagde da atter til dem: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg
      eder, jeg er Fårenes Dør.
  8.  Alle de, som ere komne før mig, ere Tyve og Røvere; men Fårene
      hørte dem ikke.
  9.  Jeg er Døren; dersom nogen går ind igennem mig, han skal
      frelses; og han skal gå ind og gå ud og finde Føde.
 10.  Tyven kommer ikke uden for at stjæle og slagte og ødelægge; jeg
      er kommen, for at de skulle have Liv og have Overflod.
 11.  Jeg er den gode Hyrde; den gode Hyrde sætter sit Liv til for
      Fårene.
 12.  Men Lejesvenden, som ikke er Hyrde, hvem Fårene ikke høre til
      ser Ulven komme og forlader Fårene og flyr, og Ulven røver dem
      og adspreder dem,
 13.  fordi han er en Lejesvend og ikke bryder sig om Fårene.
 14.  Jeg er den gode Hyrde, og jeg kender mine, og mine kende mig,
 15.  ligesom Faderen kender mig, og jeg kender Faderen; og jeg sætter
      mit Liv til for Fårene.
 16.  Og jeg har andre Får, som ikke høre til denne Fold; også dem bør
      jeg føre, og de skulle høre min Røst; og der skal blive een
      Hjord, een Hyrde.
 17.  Derfor elsker Faderen mig, fordi jeg sætter mit Liv til for at
      tage det igen.
 18.  Ingen tager det fra mig, men jeg sætter det til af mig selv. Jeg
      har Magt til at sætte det til, og jeg har Magt til at tage det
      igen.  Dette Bud modtog jeg af min Fader."
 19.  Der blev atter Splid iblandt Jøderne for disse Ords Skyld.
 20.  Og mange af dem sagde: "Han er besat og raser, hvorfor høre I
      ham?"
 21.  Andre sagde: "Dette er ikke Ord af en besat; mon en ond Ånd kan
      åbne blindes Øjne?"

 22.  Men Tempelvielsens Fest indtraf i Jerusalem. Det var Vinter;
 23.  og Jesus gik omkring i Helligdommen, i Salomons Søjlegang.
 24.  Da omringede Jøderne ham og sagde til ham: "Hvor længe holder du
      vor Sjæl i Uvished? Dersom du er Kristus, da sig os det rent
      ud!"
 25.  Jesus svarede dem: "Jeg har sagt eder det, og I tro ikke. De
      Gerninger, som jeg gør i min Faders Navn, de vidne om mig;
 26.  men I tro ikke, fordi I ikke ere af mine Får.
 27.  Mine Får høre min Røst, og jeg kender dem, og de følge mig,
 28.  og jeg giver dem et evigt Liv, og de skulle i al Evighed ikke
      fortabes, og ingen skal rive dem ud af min Hånd.
 29.  Min Fader, som har givet mig dem, er større end alle; og ingen
      kan rive noget af min Faders Hånd.
 30.  Jeg og Faderen, vi ere eet."
 31.  Da toge Jøderne atter Sten op for at stene ham.
 32.  Jesus svarede dem: "Mange gode Gerninger har jeg vist eder fra
      min Fader; for hvilken af disse Gerninger stene I mig?"
 33.  Jøderne svarede ham: "For en god Gerning stene vi dig ikke, men
      for Gudsbespottelse, og fordi du, som er et Menneske, gør dig
      selv til Gud."
 34.  Jesus svarede dem: "Er der ikke skrevet i eders Lov: Jeg har
      sagt: I ere Guder?
 35.  Når den nu har kaldt dem Guder, til hvem Guds Ord kom (og
      Skriften kan ikke rokkes),
 36.  sige I da til den, hvem Faderen har Helliget og sendt til
      Verden: Du taler bespotteligt, fordi jeg sagde: Jeg er Guds Søn?
 37.  Dersom jeg ikke gør min Faders Gerninger, så tror mig ikke!
 38.  Men dersom jeg gør dem, så tror Gerningerne, om I end ikke ville
      tro mig, for at I kunne indse og erkende, at Faderen er i mig,
      og jeg i Faderen."
 39.  De søgte da atter at gribe ham; og han undslap af deres Hånd.

 40.  Og han drog atter bort hinsides Jordan til det Sted, hvor
      Johannes først døbte, og han blev der.
 41.  Og mange kom til ham, og de sagde: "Johannes gjorde vel intet
      Tegn; men alt, hvad Johannes sagde om denne, var sandt."
 42.  Og mange troede på ham der.

Johannes 11

  1.  Men der lå en Mand syg, Lazarus fra Bethania, den Landsby, hvor
      Maria og hendes Søster Martha boede.
  2.  Men Maria var den, som salvede Herren med Salve og tørrede hans
      Fødder med sit Hår; hendes Broder Lazarus var syg.
  3.  Da sendte Søstrene Bud til ham og lod sige: "Herre! se, den, du
      elsker, er syg."
  4.  Men da Jesus hørte dette, sagde han: "Denne Sygdom er ikke til
      Døden, men for Guds Herligheds Skyld, for at Guds Søn skal
      herliggøres ved den."
  5.  Men Jesus elskede Martha og hendes Søster og Lazarus.
  6.  Da han nu hørte, at han var syg, blev han dog to Dage på det
      Sted, hvor han var.
  7.  Derefter siger han så til Disciplene:"Lader os gå til Judæa
      igen!
  8.  Disciplene sige til ham: "Rabbi! nylig søgte Jøderne at stene
      dig, og du drager atter derhen?"
  9.  Jesus svarede: "Har Dagen ikke tolv Timer? Vandrer nogen om
      Dagen, da støder han ikke an; thi han ser denne Verdens Lys.
 10.  Men vandrer nogen om Natten, da støder han an; thi Lyset er ikke
      i ham."
 11.  Dette sagde han, og derefter siger han til dem: "Lazarus, vor
      Ven, er sovet ind; men jeg går hen for at vække ham af Søvne."
 12.  Da sagde Disciplene til ham: "Herre! sover han, da bliver han
      helbredt."
 13.  Men Jesus havde talt om hans Død; de derimod mente, at han talte
      om Søvnens Hvile.
 14.  Derfor sagde da Jesus dem rent ud: "Lazarus er død!
 15.  Og for eders Skyld er jeg glad over, at jeg ikke var der, for at
      I skulle tro; men lader os gå til ham!"
 16.  Da sagde Thomas (hvilket betyder Tvilling), til sine
      Meddisciple: "Lader os også gå, for at vi kunne dø med ham!"
 17.  Da Jesus nu kom, fandt han, at han havde ligget i Graven
      allerede fire Dage.
 18.  Men Bethania var nær ved Jerusalem, omtrent femten Stadier
      derfra.
 19.  Og mange af Jøderne vare komne til Martha og Maria for at trøste
      dem over deres Broder.
 20.  Da Martha nu hørte, at Jesus kom, gik hun ham i Møde; men Maria
      blev siddende i Huset.
 21.  Da sagde Martha til Jesus: "Herre! havde du været her, da var
      min Broder ikke død.
 22.  Men også nu ved jeg, at hvad som helst du beder Gud om, vil Gud
      give dig."
 23.  Jesus siger til hende: "Din Broder skal opstå."
 24.  Martha siger til ham: "Jeg ved at han skal opstå i Opstandelsen
      på den yderste Dag."
 25.  Jesus sagde til hende: "Jeg er Opstandelsen og Livet; den, som
      tror på mig, skal leve, om han end dør.
 26.  Og hver den, som lever og tror på mig, skal i al Evighed ikke
      dø.  Tror du dette?"
 27.  Hun siger til ham: "Ja, Herre! jeg tror, at du er Kristus, Guds
      Søn, den, som kommer til Verden."
 28.  Og da hun havde sagt dette, gik hun bort og kaldte hemmeligt sin
      Søster Maria og sagde: "Mesteren er her og kalder ad dig."
 29.  Da hun hørte det, rejste hun sig hastigt og gik til ham.
 30.  Men Jesus var endnu ikke kommen til Landsbyen, men var på det
      Sted, hvor Martha havde mødt ham.
 31.  Da nu Jøderne, som vare hos hende i Huset og trøstede hende, så,
      at Maria stod hastigt op og gik ud, fulgte de hende, idet de
      mente, at hun gik ud til Graven for at græde der.
 32.  Da Maria nu kom derhen, hvor Jesus var, og så ham, faldt hun ned
      for hans Fødder og sagde til ham: "Herre! havde du været her da
      var min Broder ikke død."
 33.  Da nu Jesus så hende græde og så Jøderne, som vare komne med
      hende, græde, harmedes han i Ånden og blev heftig bevæget i sit
      Indre; og han sagde:
 34.  "Hvor have I lagt ham?" De sige til ham: "Herre! kom og se!"
 35.  Jesus græd.
 36.  Da sagde Jøderne: "Se, hvor han elskede ham!"
 37.  Men nogle af dem sagde: "Kunde ikke han, som åbnede den blindes
      Øjne, have gjort, at også denne ikke var død?"
 38.  Da harmes Jesus atter i sit Indre og går hen til Graven. Men det
      var en Hule, og en Sten lå for den.
 39.  Jesus siger: "Tager Stenen bort!" Martha, den dødes Søster,
      siger til ham: "Herre! han stinker allerede; thi han har ligget
      der fire Dage:"
 40.  Jesus siger til hende: " Sagde jeg ikke, at dersom du tror, skal
      du se Guds Herlighed?"
 41.  Da toge de Stenen bort. Men Jesus opløftede sine Øjne og sagde:
      "Fader! jeg takker dig, fordi du har hørt mig.
 42.  Jeg vidste vel, at du altid hører mig; men for Skarens Skyld,
      som står omkring, sagde jeg det, for at de skulle tro, at du har
      udsendt mig."
 43.  Og da han havde sagt dette, råbte han med høj Røst: "Lazarus,
      kom herud!"
 44.  Og den døde kom ud, bunden med Jordeklæder om Fødder og Hænder,
      og et Tørklæde var bundet om hans Ansigt, Jesus siger til dem:
      "Løser ham, og lader ham gå!"

 45.  Mange af de Jøder, som vare komne til Maria og havde set, hvad
      han havde gjort, troede nu på ham;
 46.  men nogle af dem gik hen til Farisæerne og sagde dem, hvad
      Jesus, havde gjort.
 47.  Ypperstepræsterne og Farisæerne sammenkaldte da et Møde af Rådet
      og sagde: "Hvad gøre vi? thi dette Menneske gør mange Tegn.
 48.  Dersom vi lade ham således blive ved, ville alle tro på ham, og
      Romerne ville komme og tage både vort Land og Folk."
 49.  Men en af dem, Kajfas, som var Ypperstepræst i det År, sagde til
      dem:
 50.  "I vide intet; ej heller betænke I, at det er os gavnligt, at
      eet Menneske dør for Folket, og at ikke det hele Folk skal gå
      til Grunde."
 51.  Men dette sagde han ikke af sig selv; men da han var
      Ypperstepræst i det År, profeterede han at Jesus skulde dø for
      Folket;
 52.  og ikke for Folket alene, men for at han også kunde samle Guds
      adspredte Børn sammen til eet.
 53.  Fra den Dag af rådsloge de derfor om at ihjelslå ham.

 54.  Derfor vandrede Jesus ikke mere frit om iblandt jøderne, men gik
      bort derfra ud på Landet, nær ved Ørkenen, til en By, som kaldes
      Efraim; og han blev der med sine Disciple.
 55.  Men Jødernes Påske var nær; og mange fra Landet gik op til
      Jerusalem før Påsken for at rense sig.
 56.  Da ledte de efter Jesus og sagde mellem hverandre, da de stode i
      Helligdommen: "Hvad mene I? Mon han ikke kommer til Højtiden?"
 57.  Men Ypperstepræsterne og Farisæerne havde givet Befaling om at
      dersom nogen vidste, hvor han var, skulde han give det til Kende
      for at de kunde gribe ham.

Johannes 12

  1.  Seks Dage før Påske kom Jesus nu til Bethania, hvor Lazarus
      boede, han, som Jesus havde oprejst fra de døde.
  2.  Der gjorde de da et Aftensmåltid for ham, og Martha vartede op;
      men Lazarus var en af dem, som sade til Bords med ham.
  3.  Da tog Maria et Pund af ægte, såre kostbar Nardussalve og
      salvede Jesu Fødder og tørrede hans Fødder med sit Hår; og Huset
      blev fuldt af Salvens Duft.
  4.  Da siger en af hans Disciple, Judas, Simons Søn, Iskariot, han,
      som siden forrådte ham:
  5.  "Hvorfor blev denne Salve ikke solgt for tre Hundrede Denarer og
      given til fattige?"
  6.  Men dette sagde han, ikke fordi han brød sig om de fattige, men
      fordi han var en Tyv og havde Pungen og bar, hvad der blev lagt
      deri.
  7.  Da sagde Jesus: "Lad hende med Fred, hun har jo bevaret den til
      min Begravelsesdag!
  8.  De fattige have I jo altid hos eder; men mig have I ikke altid."
  9.  En stor Skare af Jøderne fik nu at vide, at han var der; og de
      kom ikke for Jesu Skyld alene, men også for at se Lazarus, hvem
      han havde oprejst fra de døde.
 10.  Men Ypperstepræsterne rådsloge om også at slå Lazarus ihjel:
 11.  thi for hans Skyld gik mange af Jøderne hen og troede på Jesus.

 12.  Den følgende Dag, da den store Skare, som var kommen til
      Højtiden, hørte, at Jesus kom til Jerusalem,
 13.  toge de Palmegrene og gik ud imod ham og råbte: "Hosanna!
      velsignet være den, som kommer, i Herrens Navn, Israels Konge!"
 14.  Men Jesus fandt et ungt Æsel og satte sig derpå, som der er
      skrevet:
 15.  "Frygt ikke, Zions Datter! se, din Konge kommer, siddende på en
      Asenindes Føl."
 16.  Dette forstode hans Disciple ikke først; men da Jesus var
      herliggjort, da kom de i Hu, at dette var skrevet om ham, og at
      de havde gjort dette for ham.
 17.  Skaren, som var med ham, vidnede nu, at han havde kaldt Lazarus
      frem fra Graven og oprejst ham fra de døde.
 18.  Det var også derfor, at Skaren gik ham i Møde, fordi de havde
      hørt, at han havde gjort dette Tegn.
 19.  Da sagde Farisæerne til hverandre: "I se, at I udrette ikke
      noget; se, Alverden går efter ham."

 20.  Men der var nogle Grækere af dem, som plejede at gå op for at
      tilbede på Højtiden.
 21.  Disse gik nu til Filip, som var fra Bethsajda i Galilæa, og bade
      ham og sagde: "Herre! vi ønske at se Jesus."
 22.  Filip kommer og siger det til Andreas, Andreas og Filip komme og
      sige det til Jesus.
 23.  Men Jesus svarede dem og sagde: "Timen er kommen, til at
      Menneskesønnen skal herliggøres.
 24.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, hvis ikke Hvedekornet falder
      i Jorden og dør, bliver det ene; men dersom det dør, bærer det
      megen Frugt.
 25.  Den, som elsker sit Liv, skal miste det; og den, som hader sit
      Liv i denne Verden, skal bevare det til et evigt Liv.
 26.  Om nogen tjener mig, han følge mig, og hvor jeg er, der skal
      også min Tjener være; om nogen tjener mig, ham skal Faderen ære.
 27.  Nu er min Sjæl forfærdet; og hvad skal jeg sige? Fader, frels
      mig fra denne Time? Dog, derfor er jeg kommen til denne Time.
 28.  Fader herliggør dit Navn!" Da kom der en Røst fra Himmelen:
      "Både har jeg herliggjort det, og vil jeg atter herliggøre det."
 29.  Da sagde Skaren, som stod og hørte det, at det havde tordnet;
      andre sagde: "En Engel har talt til ham."
 30.  Jesus svarede og sagde: "Ikke for min Skyld er denne Røst
      kommen, men for eders Skyld.
 31.  Nu går der Dom over denne Verden, nu skal denne Verdens Fyrste
      kastes ud,
 32.  og jeg skal, når jeg bliver ophøjet fra Jorden, drage alle til
      mig."
 33.  Men dette sagde han for at betegne, hvilken Død han skulde dø.
 34.  Skaren svarede ham: "Vi have hørt af Loven, at Kristus bliver
      evindelig, og hvorledes siger da du, at Menneskesønnen bør
      ophøjes?  Hvem er denne Menneskesøn?"
 35.  Da sagde Jesus til dem: "Endnu en liden Tid er Lyset hos eder.
      Vandrer, medens I have Lyset, for at Mørke ikke skal overfalde
      eder!  Og den, som vandrer i Mørket, ved ikke, hvor han går hen.
 36.  Medens I have Lyset, tror på Lyset, for at I kunne blive Lysets
      Børn!" Dette talte Jesus, og han gik bort og blev skjult for
      dem.

 37.  Men endskønt han havde gjort så mange Tegn for deres Øjne,
      troede de dog ikke på ham,
 38.  for at Profeten Esajas's Ord skulde opfyldes, som han har sagt:
      "Herre! hvem troede det, han hørte af os, og for hvem blev
      Herrens Arm åbenbaret?"
 39.  Derfor kunde de ikke tro, fordi Esajas har atter sagt:
 40.  "Han har blindet deres Øjne og forhærdet deres Hjerte, for at de
      ikke skulle se med Øjnene og forstå med Hjertet og omvende sig,
      så jeg kunde helbrede dem."
 41.  Dette sagde Esajas, fordi han så hans Herlighed og talte om ham.
 42.  Alligevel var der dog mange, endogså af Rådsherrerne, som troede
      på ham; men for Farisæernes Skyld bekendte de det ikke, for at
      de ikke skulde blive udelukkede af Synagogen;
 43.  thi de elskede Menneskenes Ære mere end Guds Ære.
 44.  Men Jesus råbte og sagde: "Den, som tror på mig, tror ikke på
      mig, men på ham, som sendte mig,
 45.  og den, som ser mig, ser den, som sendte mig.
 46.  Jeg er kommen som et Lys til Verden, for at hver den, som tror
      på mig, ikke skal blive i Mørket.
 47.  Og om nogen hører mine Ord og ikke vogter på dem, ham dømmer
      ikke jeg; thi jeg er ikke kommen for at dømme Verden, men for at
      frelse Verden.
 48.  Den, som foragter mig og ikke modtager mine Ord, har den, som
      dømmer ham; det Ord, som jeg har talt, det skal dømme ham på den
      yderste Dag.
 49.  Thi jeg har ikke talt af mig selv; men Faderen, som sendte mig,
      han har givet mig Befaling om, hvad jeg skal sige, og hvad jeg
      skal tale.
 50.  Og jeg ved, at hans Befaling er evigt Liv. Altså, hvad jeg
      taler, taler jeg således, som Faderen har sagt mig."

Johannes 13

  1.  Men før Påskehøjtiden, da Jesus vidste, at hans Time var kommen,
      til at han skulde gå bort fra denne Verden til Faderen, da,
      ligesom han havde elsket sine egne, som vare i Verden, så
      elskede han dem indtil Enden.
  2.  Og medens der holdtes Aftensmåltid, da Djævelen allerede havde
      indskudt i Judas's, Simons Søns, Iskariots Hjerte, at han skulde
      forråde ham;
  3.  da Jesus vidste, at Faderen havde givet ham alle Ting i Hænde,
      og at han var udgået fra Gud og gik hen til Gud:
  4.  så rejser han sig fra Måltidet og lægger sine Klæder fra sig, og
      han tog et Linklæde og bandt det om sig.
  5.  Derefter hælder han Vand i Vaskefadet og begyndte at to
      Disciplenes Fødder og at tørre dem med Linklædet, som han var
      ombunden med.
  6.  Han kommer da til Simon Peter; og denne siger til ham: "Herre!
      tor du mine Fødder?"
  7.  Jesus svarede og sagde til ham: "Hvad jeg gør, ved du ikke nu,
      men du skal forstå det siden efter."
  8.  Peter siger til ham: "Du skal i al Evighed ikke to mine Fødder."
      Jesus svarede ham: "Dersom jeg ikke tor dig, har du ikke Lod
      sammen med mig."
  9.  Simon Peter siger til ham: "Herre! ikke mine Fødder alene, men
      også Hænderne og Hovedet."
 10.  Jesus siger til ham: "Den, som er tvættet, har ikke nødig at to
      andet end Fødderne, men er ren over det hele; og I ere rene, men
      ikke alle."
 11.  Thi han kendte den, som forrådte ham; derfor sagde han: "I ere
      ikke alle rene."
 12.  Da han nu havde toet deres Fødder og havde taget sine Klæder og
      atter sat sig til Bords, sagde han til dem: "Vide I, hvad jeg
      har gjort ved eder?
 13.  I kalde mig Mester og Herre, og I tale ret, thi jeg er det.
 14.  Når da jeg, Herren og Mesteren, har toet eders Fødder, så ere
      også I skyldige at to hverandres Fødder.
 15.  Thi jeg har givet eder et Eksempel, for at, ligesom jeg gjorde
      ved eder, skulle også I gøre.
 16.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, en Tjener er ikke større end
      sin Herre, ikke heller et Sendebud større end den, som har sendt
      ham.
 17.  Når I vide dette, ere I salige, om I gøre det.
 18.  Jeg taler ikke om eder alle; jeg ved, hvilke jeg har udvalgt;
      men Skriften måtte opfyldes: Den, som æder Brødet med mig, har
      opløftet sin Hæl imod mig.
 19.  Fra nu af siger jeg eder det, førend det sker, for at I, når det
      er sket, skulle tro, at det er mig.
 20.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, den, som modtager, hvem jeg
      sender, modtager mig; men den, som modtager mig, modtager ham,
      som har sendt mig."

 21.  Da Jesus havde sagt dette, blev han heftigt bevæget i Ånden og
      vidnede og sagde: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, en af
      eder vil forråde mig."
 22.  Da så Disciplene på hverandre, tvivlrådige om, hvem han talte
      om.
 23.  Men der var en iblandt hans Disciple, som sad til Bords ved Jesu
      Side, han, hvem Jesus elskede.
 24.  Til denne nikker da Simon Peter og siger til ham: "Sig, hvem det
      er, han taler om?"
 25.  Men denne bøjer sig op til Jesu Bryst og siger til ham: "Herre!
      hvem er det?"
 26.  Jesus svarer: "Det er den, hvem jeg giver det Stykke Brød, som
      jeg dypper." Så dypper han Stykket og tager og giver det til
      Judas, Simons Søn, Iskariot.
 27.  Og efter at han havde fået Stykket, da gik Satan ind i ham. Så
      siger Jesus til ham: "Hvad du gør, gør det snart!"
 28.  Men ingen af dem, som sade til Bords, forstod, hvorfor han sagde
      ham dette.
 29.  Thi nogle mente, efterdi Judas havde Pungen, at Jesus sagde til
      ham: "Køb, hvad vi have nødig til Højtiden;" eller at han skulde
      give noget til de fattige.
 30.  Da han nu havde fået Stykket, gik han straks ud. Men det var
      Nat.

 31.  Da han nu var gået ud, siger Jesus: "Nu er Menneskesønnen
      herliggjort, og Gud er herliggjort i ham.
 32.  Dersom Gud er herliggjort i ham, skal Gud også herliggøre ham i
      sig, og han skal snart herliggøre ham.
 33.  Børnlille! endnu en liden Stund er jeg hos eder. I skulle lede
      efter mig, og ligesom jeg sagde til Jøderne: "Hvor jeg går hen,
      kunne I ikke komme," siger jeg nu også til eder.
 34.  Jeg giver eder en ny Befaling, at I skulle elske hverandre, at
      ligesom jeg elskede eder, skulle også I elske hverandre.
 35.  Derpå skulle alle kende, at I ere mine Disciple, om I have
      indbyrdes Kærlighed."

 36.  Simon Peter siger til ham: "Herre! hvor går du hen?" Jesus
      svarede ham: "Hvor jeg går hen, kan du ikke nu følge mig, men
      siden skal du følge mig."
 37.  Peter siger til ham: "Herre! hvorfor kan jeg ikke følge dig nu?
      Jeg vil sætte mit Liv til for dig?
 38.  Jesus svarer: "Vil du sætte dit Liv til for mig? Sandelig,
      sandelig, siger jeg dig, Hanen skal ikke gale, førend du har
      fornægtet mig tre Gange."

Johannes 14

  1.  "Eders Hjerte forfærdes ikke! Tror på Gud, og tror på mig!
  2.  I min Faders Hus er der mange Boliger. Dersom det ikke var så,
      havde jeg sagt eder det; thi jeg går bort for at berede eder
      Sted.
  3.  Og når jeg er gået bort og har beredt eder Sted, kommer jeg igen
      og tager eder til mig, for at, hvor jeg er, der skulle også I
      være.
  4.  Og hvor jeg går hen, derhen vide I Vejen."
  5.  Thomas siger til ham: "Herre! vi vide ikke, hvor du går hen; og
      hvorledes kunne vi vide Vejen?"
  6.  Jesus siger til ham: "Jeg er Vejen og Sandheden og Livet; der
      kommer ingen til Faderen uden ved mig.
  7.  Havde I kendt mig, da havde I også kendt min Fader; og fra nu af
      kende I ham og have set ham."
  8.  Filip siger til ham: "Herre! vis os Faderen, og det er os nok."
  9.  Jesus siger til ham: "Så lang en Tid har jeg været hos eder, og
      du kender mig ikke, Filip? Den, som har set mig, har set
      Faderen; hvorledes kan du da sige: Vis os Faderen?
 10.  Tror du ikke, at jeg er i Faderen, og Faderen er i mig? De Ord,
      som jeg siger til eder, taler jeg ikke af mig selv; men Faderen,
      som bliver i mig, han gør sine Gerninger.
 11.  Tror mig, at jeg er i Faderen, og Faderen er i mig; men ville I
      ikke, så tror mig dog for selve Gerningernes Skyld!

 12.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, den, som tror på mig, de
      Gerninger, som jeg gør, skal også han gøre, og han skal gøre
      større Gerninger end disse; thi jeg går til Faderen,
 13.  og hvad som helst I bede om i mit Navn, det vil jeg gøre, for at
      Faderen må herliggøres ved Sønnen.
 14.  Dersom I bede om noget i mit Navn, vil jeg gøre det.
 15.  Dersom I elske mig, da holder mine Befalinger!
 16.  Og jeg vil bede Faderen, og han skal give eder en anden Talsmand
      til at være hos eder evindelig,
 17.  den Sandhedens Ånd, som Verden ikke kan modtage, thi den ser den
      ikke og kender den ikke; men I kende den, thi den bliver hos
      eder og skal være i eder.
 18.  Jeg vil ikke efterlade eder faderløse; jeg kommer til eder.
 19.  Endnu en liden Stund, og Verden ser mig ikke mere, men I se mig;
      thi jeg lever, og I skulle leve.
 20.  På den Dag skulle I erkende, at jeg er i min Fader, og I i mig,
      og jeg i eder.
 21.  Den, som har mine Befalinger og holder dem, han er den, som
      elsker mig; men den, som elsker mig, skal elskes af min Fader;
      og jeg skal elske ham og åbenbare mig for ham."
 22.  Judas (ikke Iskariot) siger til ham: "Herre! hvor kommer det, at
      du vil åbenbare dig for os og ikke for verden?"
 23.  Jesus svarede og sagde til ham: "Om nogen elsker mig, vil han
      holde mit Ord; og min Fader skal elske ham, og vi skulle komme
      til ham og tage Bolig hos ham.
 24.  Den, som ikke elsker mig, holder ikke mine Ord; og det Ord, som
      I høre, er ikke mit, men Faderens, som sendte mig.

 25.  Dette har jeg talt til eder, medens jeg blev hos eder.
 26.  Men Talsmanden, den Helligånd, som Faderen vil sende i mit Navn,
      han skal lære eder alle Ting og minde eder om alle Ting, som jeg
      har sagt eder.
 27.  Fred efterlader jeg eder, min Fred giver jeg eder; jeg giver
      eder ikke, som Verden giver. Eders Hjerte forfærdes ikke og
      forsage ikke!
 28.  I have hørt, at jeg sagde til eder: Jeg går bort og kommer til
      eder igen. Dersom I elskede mig, da glædede I eder over, at jeg
      går til Faderen; thi Faderen er større end jeg.
 29.  Og nu har jeg sagt eder det, før det sker, for at I skulle tro,
      når det er sket.
 30.  Jeg skal herefter ikke tale meget med eder; thi denne Verdens
      Fyrste kommer, og han har slet intet i mig;
 31.  men for at verden skal kende, at jeg elsker Faderen og gør
      således, som Faderen har befalet mig: så står nu op, lader os gå
      herfra!"

Johannes 15

  1.  "Jeg er det sande Vintræ, og min Fader er Vingårdsmanden.
  2.  Hver Gren på mig, som ikke bærer Frugt, den borttager han, og
      hver den, som bærer Frugt, renser han, for at den skal bære mere
      Frugt.
  3.  I ere allerede rene på Grund af det Ord, som jeg har talt til
      eder.
  4.  Bliver i mig, da bliver også jeg i eder. Ligesom Grenen ikke kan
      bære Frugt af sig selv, uden den bliver på Vintræet, således
      kunne I ikke heller, uden I blive i mig.
  5.  Jeg er Vintræet, I ere Grenene. Den, som bliver i mig, og jeg i
      ham, han bærer megen Frugt; thi uden mig kunne I slet intet
      gøre.
  6.  Om nogen ikke bliver i mig, han bliver udkastet som en Gren og
      visner; man sanker dem og kaster dem i Ilden, og de brændes.
  7.  Dersom I blive i mig, og mine Ord blive i eder, da beder, om
      hvad som helst I ville, og det skal blive eder til Del.
  8.  Derved er min Fader herliggjort, at I bære megen Frugt, og I
      skulle blive mine Disciple.

  9.  Ligesom Faderen har elsket mig, så har også jeg elsket eder;
      bliver i min Kærlighed!
 10.  Dersom I holde mine Befalinger, skulle I blive i min Kærlighed,
      ligesom jeg har holdt min Faders Befalinger og bliver i hans
      Kærlighed.
 11.  Dette har jeg talt til eder, for at min Glæde kan være i eder,
      og eders Glæde kan blive fuldkommen.
 12.  Dette er min Befaling, at I skulle elske hverandre, ligesom jeg
      har elsket eder.
 13.  Større Kærlighed har ingen end denne, at han sætter sit Liv til
      for sine Venner.
 14.  I ere mine Venner, dersom I gøre, hvad jeg befaler eder.
 15.  Jeg kalder eder ikke længere Tjenere; thi Tjeneren ved ikke,
      hvad hans Herre gør; men eder har jeg kaldt Venner; thi alt det,
      som jeg har hørt af min Fader, har jeg kundgjort eder.
 16.  I have ikke udvalgt mig, men jeg har udvalgt eder og sat eder
      til, at I skulle gå hen og bære Frugt, og eders Frugt skal blive
      ved, for at Faderen skal give eder, hvad som helst I bede ham om
      i mit Navn.
 17.  Dette befaler jeg eder, at I skulle elske hverandre.

 18.  Når Verden hader eder, da vid, at den har hadet mig førend eder.
 19.  Vare I af Verden, da vilde Verden elske sit eget; men fordi I
      ikke ere af Verden, men jeg har valgt eder ud af Verden, derfor
      hader Verden eder.
 20.  Kommer det Ord i Hu, som jeg har sagt eder: En Tjener er ikke
      større end sin Herre. Have de forfulgt mig, ville de også
      forfølge eder; have de holdt mit Ord, ville de også holde eders.
 21.  Men alt dette ville de gøre imod eder for mit Navns Skyld, fordi
      de ikke kende den, som sendte mig.
 22.  Dersom jeg ikke var kommen og havde talt til dem, havde de ikke
      Synd; men nu have de ingen Undskyldning for deres Synd.
 23.  Den, som hader mig, hader også min Fader.
 24.  Havde jeg ikke gjort de Gerninger iblandt dem, som ingen anden
      har gjort, havde de ikke Synd; men nu have de set dem og dog
      hadet både mig og min Fader.
 25.  Dog, det Ord, som er skrevet i deres Lov, må opfyldes: De hadede
      mig uforskyldt.
 26.  Men når Talsmanden kommer, som jeg skal sende eder fra Faderen,
      Sandhedens Ånd, som udgår fra Faderen, da skal han vidne om mig.
 27.  Men også I skulle vidne; thi I vare med mig fra Begyndelsen."

Johannes 16

  1.  "Dette har jeg talt til eder, for at I ikke skulle forarges.
  2.  De skulle udelukke eder af Synagogerne, ja, den Tid skal komme,
      at hver den, som slår eder ihjel, skal mene, at han viser Gud en
      Dyrkelse.
  3.  Og dette skulle de gøre, fordi de hverken kende Faderen eller
      mig.
  4.  Men dette har jeg talt til eder, for at I, når Timen kommer,
      skulle komme i Hu, at jeg har sagt eder det; men dette sagde jeg
      eder ikke fra Begyndelsen, fordi jeg var hos eder.

  5.  Men nu går jeg hen til ham, som sendte mig, og ingen af eder
      spørger mig: Hvor går du hen?
  6.  Men fordi jeg har talt dette til eder, har Bedrøvelsen opfyldt
      eders Hjerte.
  7.  Men jeg siger eder Sandheden: Det er eder gavnligt, at jeg går
      bort, thi går jeg ikke bort, kommer Talsmanden ikke til eder;
      men går jeg bort, så vil jeg sende ham til eder.
  8.  Og når han kommer, skal han overbevise Verden om Synd og om
      Retfærdighed og om Dom.
  9.  Om Synd, fordi de ikke tro på mig;
 10.  men om Retfærdighed, fordi jeg går til min Fader, og I se mig
      ikke længer;
 11.  men om Dom, fordi denne Verdens Fyrste er dømt.
 12.  Jeg har endnu meget at sige eder; men I kunne ikke bære det nu.
 13.  Men når han, Sandhedens Ånd, kommer, skal han vejlede eder til
      hele Sandheden; thi han skal ikke tale af sig selv, men hvad som
      helst han hører, skal han tale, og de kommende Ting skal han
      forkynde eder.
 14.  Han skal herliggøre mig; thi han skal tage af mit og forkynde
      eder.
 15.  Alt, hvad Faderen har, er mit; derfor sagde jeg, at han skal
      tage af mit og forkynde eder.

 16.  Om en liden Stund skulle I ikke se mig længer, og atter om en
      liden Stund skulle I se mig."
 17.  Da sagde nogle af hans Disciple til hverandre: "Hvad er dette,
      som han siger os: Om en liden Stund skulle I ikke se mig, og
      atter om en liden Stund skulle I se mig, og: Jeg går hen til
      Faderen?"
 18.  De sagde altså: "Hvad er dette, han siger: Om en liden Stund?
      Vi forstå ikke, hvad han taler."
 19.  Jesus vidste, at de vilde spørge ham, og han sagde til dem: "I
      spørge hverandre om dette, at jeg sagde: Om en liden Stund
      skulle I ikke se mig, og atter om en liden Stund skulle I se
      mig.
 20.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, I skulle græde og jamre, men
      Verden skal glæde sig; I skulle være bedrøvede, men eders
      Bedrøvelse skal blive til Glæde.
 21.  Når Kvinden føder, har hun Bedrøvelse, fordi hendes Time er
      kommen; men når hun har født Barnet, kommer hun ikke mere sin
      Trængsel i Hu af Glæde over, at et Menneske er født til Verden.
 22.  Også I have da vel nu Bedrøvelse, men jeg skal se eder igen, og
      eders Hjerte skal glædes, og ingen tager eders Glæde fra eder.
 23.  Og på den Dag skulle I ikke spørge mig om noget. Sandelig,
      sandelig, siger jeg eder, hvad som helst I bede Faderen om, skal
      han give eder i mit Navn.
 24.  Hidindtil have I ikke bedt om noget i mit Navn; beder, og I
      skulle få, for at eders Glæde må blive fuldkommen.
 25.  Dette har jeg talt til eder i Lignelser; der kommer en Time, da
      jeg ikke mere skal tale til eder i Lignelser, men frit ud
      forkynde eder om Faderen.
 26.  På den Dag skulle I bede i mit Navn, og jeg siger ikke til eder,
      at jeg vil bede Faderen for eder;
 27.  thi Faderen selv elsker eder, fordi I have elsket mig og troet,
      at jeg er udgået fra Gud.
 28.  Jeg udgik fra Faderen og er kommen til Verden; jeg forlader
      Verden igen og går til Faderen."
 29.  Hans Disciple sige til ham: "Se, nu taler du frit ud og siger
      ingen Lignelse.
 30.  Nu vide vi, at du ved alle Ting og ikke har nødig, at nogen
      spørger dig; desårsag tro vi, at du er udgået fra Gud."
 31.  Jesus svarede dem: "Nu tro I!
 32.  Se, den Time kommer, og den er kommen, da I skulle adspredes
      hver til sit og lade mig alene; dog, jeg er ikke alene, thi
      Faderen er med mig.
 33.  Dette har jeg talt til eder, for at I skulle have Fred i mig. I
      Verden have I Trængsel; men værer frimodige, jeg har overvundet
      Verden."

Johannes 17

  1.  Dette talte Jesus;og han opløftede sine Øjne til Himmelen og
      sagde: "Fader! Timen er kommen; herliggør din Søn, for at Sønnen
      må herliggøre dig,
  2.  ligesom du har givet ham Magt over alt Kød, for at han skal give
      alle dem, som du har givet ham, evigt Liv.
  3.  Men dette er det evige Liv, at de kende dig, den eneste sande
      Gud, og den, du udsendte, Jesus Kristus.
  4.  Jeg har herliggjort dig på Jorden ved at fuldbyrde den Gerning,
      som du har givet mig at gøre.
  5.  Og Fader! herliggør du mig nu hos dig selv med den Herlighed,
      som jeg havde hos dig, før Verden var.

  6.  Jeg har åbenbaret dit Navn for de Mennesker, som du har givet
      mig ud af Verden; de vare dine, og du gav mig dem. og de have
      holdt dit Ord.
  7.  Nu vide de, at alt det, som du har givet mig, er fra dig.
  8.  Thi de Ord, som du har givet mig, har jeg givet dem; og de have
      modtaget dem og erkendt i Sandhed, at jeg udgik fra dig, og de
      have troet, at du har udsendt mig.
  9.  Jeg beder for dem; jeg beder ikke for Verden, men for dem, som
      du har givet mig; thi de ere dine.
 10.  Og alt mit er dit, og dit er mit; og jeg er herliggjort i dem.
 11.  Og jeg er ikke mere i Verden, men disse ere i Verden, og jeg
      kommer til dig. Hellige Fader! bevar dem i dit Navn, hvilket du
      har givet mig, for at de må være et ligesom vi.
 12.  Da jeg var hos dem, bevarede jeg dem i dit Navn, hvilket du har
      givet mig, og jeg vogtede dem, og ingen af dem blev fortabt,
      uden Fortabelsens Søn, for at Skriften skulde opfyldes.
 13.  Men nu kommer jeg til dig, og dette taler jeg i Verden, for at
      de må have min Glæde fuldkommet i sig.
 14.  Jeg har givet dem dit Ord; og Verden har hadet dem, fordi de
      ikke ere af Verden, ligesom jeg ikke er af Verden.
 15.  Jeg beder ikke om, at du vil tage dem ud af Verden, men at du
      vil bevare dem fra det onde.
 16.  De ere ikke af Verden, ligesom jeg ikke er af Verden.
 17.  Hellige dem i Sandheden; dit Ord er Sandhed.
 18.  Ligesom du har udsendt mig til Verden, så har også jeg udsendt
      dem til Verden.
 19.  Og jeg helliger mig selv for dem, for at også de skulle være
      helligede i Sandheden.

 20.  Men jeg beder ikke alene for disse, men også for dem, som ved
      deres Ord tro på mig,
 21.  at de må alle være eet; ligesom du, Fader! i mig, og jeg i dig,
      at også de skulle være eet i os, for at Verden må tro, at du har
      udsendt mig.
 22.  Og den Herlighed, som du har givet mig, har jeg givet dem, for
      at de skulle være eet, ligesom vi ere eet,
 23.  jeg i dem og du i mig, for at de må være fuldkommede til eet,
      for at Verden må erkende, at du har udsendt mig og har elsket
      dem, ligesom du har elsket mig.
 24.  Fader! jeg vil, at, hvor jeg er, skulle også de, som du har
      givet mig, være hos mig, for at de må skue min Herlighed, som du
      har givet mig; thi du har elsket mig før Verdens Grundlæggelse.
 25.  Retfærdige Fader! og Verden har ikke kendt dig, men jeg har
      kendt dig, og disse have kendt, at du har udsendt mig.
 26.  Og jeg har kundgjort dem dit Navn og vil kundgøre dem det, for
      at den Kærlighed, hvormed du har elsket mig, skal være i dem, og
      jeg i dem."

Johannes 18

  1.  Da Jesus havde sagt dette, gik han ud med sine Disciple over
      Kedrons Bæk, hvor der var en Have, i hvilken han gik ind med
      sine Disciple.
  2.  Men også Judas, som forrådte ham, kendte Stedet; thi Jesus
      samledes ofte der med sine Disciple.
  3.  Så tager Judas Vagtafdelingen og Svende fra Ypperstepræsterne og
      Farisæerne og kommer derhen med Fakler og Lamper og Våben.
  4.  Da nu Jesus vidste alt, hvad der skulde komme over ham, gik han
      frem og sagde til dem: "Hvem lede I efter?"
  5.  De svarede ham: "Jesus af Nazareth." Jesus siger til dem: "Det
      er mig." Men også Judas, som forrådte ham, stod hos dem.
  6.  Som han da sagde til dem: "Det er mig," vege de tilbage og faldt
      til Jorden.
  7.  Han spurgte dem nu atter: "Hvem lede I efter?" Men de sagde:
      "Jesus af Nazareth."
  8.  Jesus svarede: "Jeg har sagt eder, at det er mig; dersom I da
      lede efter mig, så lader disse gå!"
  9.  for at det Ord skulde opfyldes, som han havde sagt: "Jeg mistede
      ingen af dem, som du har givet mig."
 10.  Simon Peter, som havde et Sværd, drog det nu og slog
      Ypperstepræstens Tjener og afhuggede hans højre Øre. Men
      Tjeneren hed Malkus.
 11.  Da sagde Jesus til Peter: "Stik dit Sværd i Skeden! Skal jeg
      ikke drikke den Kalk, som min Fader har givet mig?"

 12.  Vagtafdelingen og Krigsøversten og Jødernes Svende grebe da
      Jesus og bandt ham.
 13.  Og de førte ham først til Annas; thi han var Svigerfader til
      Kajfas, som var Ypperstepræst i det År.
 14.  Men det var Kajfas, som havde givet Jøderne det Råd, at det var
      gavnligt, at eet Menneske døde for Folket.
 15.  Men Simon Peter og en anden Discipel fulgte Jesus, og den
      Discipel var kendt med Ypperstepræsten, og han gik ind med Jesus
      i Ypperstepræstens Gård.
 16.  Men Peter stod udenfor ved Døren. Da gik den anden Discipel, som
      var kendt med Ypperstepræsten, ud og sagde det til Dørvogtersken
      og førte Peter ind.
 17.  Pigen, som var Dørvogterske, siger da til Peter: "Er også du af
      dette Menneskes Disciple?" Han siger: "Nej, jeg er ikke."
 18.  Men Tjenerne og Svendene stode og havde gjort en Kulild (thi det
      var koldt) og varmede sig; men også Peter stod hos dem og
      varmede sig.
 19.  Ypperstepræsten spurgte nu Jesus om hans Disciple og om hans
      Lære.
 20.  Jesus svarede ham: "Jeg har talt frit ud til Verden; jeg har
      altid lært i Synagoger og i Helligdommen, der, hvor alle Jøderne
      komme sammen, og i Løndom har jeg intet talt.
 21.  Hvorfor spørger du mig? Spørg dem, som have hørt, hvad jeg talte
      til dem; se, de vide, hvad jeg har sagt."
 22.  Men som han sagde dette, gav en af Svendene, som stode hos,
      Jesus et Slag i Ansigtet og sagde: "Svarer du Ypperstepræsten
      således?"
 23.  Jesus svarede ham: "Har jeg talt ilde, da bevis, at det er ondt:
      men har jeg talt ret, hvorfor slår du mig da?"
 24.  Annas sendte ham nu bunden til Ypperstepræsten Kajfas.
 25.  Men Simon Peter stod og varmede sig. Da sagde de til ham: "Er
      også du af hans Disciple?" Han nægtede det og sagde: "Nej, jeg
      er ikke."
 26.  En af Ypperstepræstens Tjenere, som var en Frænde af ham, hvis
      Øre Peter havde afhugget, siger: "Så jeg dig ikke i Haven med
      ham?"
 27.  Da nægtede Peter det atter, og straks galede Hanen.

 28.  De føre nu Jesus fra Kajfas til Landshøvdingens Borg; men det
      var årle. Og de gik ikke ind i Borgen, for at de ikke skulde
      besmittes, men kunde spise Påske,
 29.  Pilatus gik da ud til dem, og han siger: "Hvad Klagemål føre I
      mod dette Menneske?"
 30.  De svarede og sagde til ham: "Var han ikke en Ugerningsmand, da
      havde vi ikke overgivet ham til dig."
 31.  Da sagde Pilatus til dem: "Tager I ham og dømmer ham efter eders
      Lov!" Da sagde Jøderne til ham: "Det er os ikke tilladt at
      aflive nogen; "
 32.  for at Jesu Ord skulde opfyldes, det, som han sagde, da han gav
      til Kende, hvilken Død han skulde dø.
 33.  Da gik Pilatus igen ind i Borgen og kaldte på Jesus og sagde til
      ham: "Er du Jødernes Konge?"
 34.  Jesus svarede: "Siger du dette af dig selv, eller have andre
      sagt dig det om mig?"
 35.  Pilatus svarede: "Mon jeg er en Jøde? dit Folk og
      Ypperstepræsterne have overgivet dig til mig; hvad har du
      gjort?"
 36.  Jesus svarede: "Mit Rige er ikke af denne Verden. Var mit Rige
      af denne verden, havde mine Tjenere stridt for, at jeg ikke var
      bleven overgiven til Jøderne; men nu er mit Rige ikke deraf."
 37.  Da sagde Pilatus til ham: "Du er altså dog en Konge?" Jesus
      svarede: "Du siger det, jeg er en Konge. Jeg er dertil født og
      dertil kommen til Verden, at jeg skal vidne om Sandheden. Hver
      den, som er af Sandheden, hører min Røst."
 38.  Pilatus siger til ham: "Hvad er Sandhed?" Og da han havde sagt
      dette, gik han igen ud til Jøderne, og han siger til dem: "Jeg
      finder ingen Skyld hos ham.
 39.  Men I have den Skik, at jeg løslade eder en om Påsken; ville I
      da, at jeg skal løslade eder Jødernes Konge?"
 40.  Da råbte de alle igen og sagde: "Ikke ham, men Barabbas;" og
      Barabbas var en Røver.

Johannes 19

  1.  Nu tog da Pilatus Jesus og lod ham hudstryge.
  2.  Og Stridsmændene flettede en Krone af Torne og satte den på hans
      Hoved og kastede en Purpurkappe om ham, og de gik hen til ham og
      sagde:
  3.  "Hil være dig, du Jødernes Konge!" og de sloge ham i Ansigtet.
  4.  Og Pilatus gik atter ud, og han siger til dem: "Se, jeg fører
      ham ud til eder, for at I skulle vide, at jeg finder ingen Skyld
      hos ham."
  5.  Da gik Jesus ud med Tornekronen og Purpurkappen på. Og han siger
      til dem: "Se, hvilket Menneske!"
  6.  Da nu Ypperstepræsterne og Svendene så ham, råbte de og sagde:
      "Korsfæst! korsfæst!" Pilatus siger til dem: "Tager I ham og
      korsfæster ham; thi jeg finder ikke Skyld hos ham."
  7.  Jøderne svarede ham: "Vi have en Lov, og efter denne Lov er han
      skyldig at dø, fordi han har gjort sig selv til Guds Søn."
  8.  Da Pilatus nu hørte dette Ord, blev han endnu mere bange.
  9.  Og han gik ind igen i Borgen og siger til Jesus: "Hvorfra er
      du?"  Men Jesus gav ham intet Svar.
 10.  Pilatus siger da til ham: "Taler du ikke til mig? Ved du ikke,
      at jeg har Magt til at løslade dig, og at jeg har Magt til at
      korsfæste dig?"
 11.  Jesus svarede: "Du havde aldeles ingen Magt over mig, dersom den
      ikke var givet dig ovenfra; derfor har den, som overgav mig til
      dig, større Synd."
 12.  Derefter forsøgte Pilatus at løslade ham. Men Jøderne råbte og
      sagde: "Dersom du løslader denne, er du ikke Kejserens Ven. Hver
      den, som gør sig selv til Konge, sætter sig op imod Kejseren."
 13.  Da Pilatus hørte disse Ord, førte han Jesus ud og satte sig på
      Dommersædet, på det Sted, som kaldes Stenlagt, men på Hebraisk
      Gabbatha;
 14.  men det var Beredelsens dag i Påsken, ved den sjette Time. Og
      han siger til Jøderne: "Se, eders Konge!"
 15.  De råbte nu: "Bort, bort med ham! korsfæst ham!" Pilatus siger
      til dem: "Skal jeg korsfæste eders Konge?" Ypperstepræsterne
      svarede: "Vi have ingen Konge uden Kejseren."
 16.  Så overgav han ham da til dem til at korsfæstes. De toge nu
      Jesus;

 17.  og han bar selv sit Kors og gik ud til det såkaldte
      "Hovedskalsted", som hedder på Hebraisk Golgatha,
 18.  hvor de korsfæstede ham og to andre med ham, en på hver Side,
      men Jesus midt imellem.
 19.  Men Pilatus havde også skrevet en Overskrift og sat den på
      Korset. Men der var skrevet:"Jesus af Nazareth, Jødernes Konge."
 20.  Denne Overskrift læste da mange af Jøderne; thi det Sted, hvor
      Jesus blev korsfæstet, var nær ved Staden; og den var skreven på
      Hebraisk, Latin og Græsk.
 21.  Da sagde Jødernes Ypperstepræster til Pilatus: "Skriv ikke:
      Jødernes Konge, men: Han sagde: Jeg er Jødernes Konge."
 22.  Pilatus svarede: "Hvad jeg skrev, det skrev jeg."
 23.  Da nu Stridsmændene havde korsfæstet Jesus, toge de hans Klæder
      og gjorde fire Dele, een Del for hver Stridsmand, og ligeledes
      Kjortelen; men Kjortelen var usyet, vævet fra øverst helt
      igennem.
 24.  Da sagde de til hverandre: "Lader os ikke sønderskære den, men
      kaste Lod om den, hvis den skal være;" for at Skriften skulde
      opfyldes, som siger: "De delte mine Klæder imellem sig og
      kastede Lod om mit Klædebon." Dette gjorde da Stridsmændene.
 25.  Men ved Jesu Kors stod hans Moder og hans Moders Søster, Maria,
      Klopas's Hustru, og Maria Magdalene.
 26.  Da Jesus nu så sin Moder og den Discipel, han elskede, stå hos,
      siger han til sin Moder: "Kvinde! se, det er din Søn."
 27.  Derefter siger han til Disciplen: "Se, det er din Moder." Og fra
      den time tog Disciplen hende hjem til sit.
 28.  Derefter, da Jesus vidste, at alting nu var fuldbragt, for at
      Skriften skulde opfyldes, siger han: "Jeg tørster."
 29.  Der stod et Kar fuldt af Eddike; de satte da en Svamp fuld af
      Eddike på en Isopstængel og holdt den til hans Mund.
 30.  Da nu Jesus havde taget Eddiken, sagde han:"Det er fuldbragt;"
      og han bøjede Hovedet og opgav Ånden.

 31.  Da det nu var Beredelsesdag, bade Jøderne Pilatus om, at Benene
      måtte blive knuste og Legemerne nedtagne, for at de ikke skulde
      blive på Korset Sabbaten over; thi denne Sabbatsdag var stor.
 32.  Da kom Stridsmændene og knuste Benene på den første og på den
      anden; som vare korsfæstede med ham.
 33.  Men da de kom til Jesus og så, at han allerede var død, knuste
      de ikke hans Ben.
 34.  Men en af Stridsmændene stak ham i Siden med et Spyd, og straks
      flød der Blod og Vand ud.
 35.  Og den, der har set det, har vidnet det, og hans Vidnesbyrd er
      sandt, og han ved, at han siger sandt, for at også I skulle tro.
 36.  Thi disse Ting skete, for at Skriften skulde opfyldes: "Intet
      Ben skal sønderbrydes derpå".
 37.  Og atter et andet Skriftord siger: "De skulle se hen til ham,
      hvem de have gennemstunget."

 38.  Men Josef fra Arimathæa, som var en Jesu Discipel, dog lønligt,
      af Frygt for Jøderne, bad derefter Pilatus om, at han måtte tage
      Jesu Legeme, og Pilatus tillod det. Da kom han og tog Jesu
      Legeme.
 39.  Men også Nikodemus, som første Gang var kommen til Jesus om
      Natten, kom og bragte en Blanding af Myrra og Aloe, omtrent
      hundrede Pund.
 40.  De toge da Jesu Legeme og bandt det i Linklæder med de
      vellugtende Urter, som Jødernes Skik er at fly Lig til Jorde.
 41.  Men der var på det Sted, hvor han blev korsfæstet, en Have, og i
      Haven en ny Grav, hvori endnu aldrig nogen var lagt.
 42.  Der lagde de da Jesus, for Jødernes Beredelses dags Skyld,
      efterdi Graven var nær.

Johannes 20

  1.  Men på den første Dag; i Ugen kommer Maria Magdalene årle,
      medens det endnu er mørkt, til Graven og ser Stenen borttagen
      fra Graven,
  2.  Da løber hun og kommer til Simon Peter og til den anden
      Discipel, ham, hvem Jesus elskede, og siger til dem: "De have
      borttaget Herren af Graven, og vi vide ikke, hvor de have lagt
      ham."
  3.  Da gik Peter og den anden Discipel ud, og de kom til Graven.
  4.  Men de to løb sammen, og den anden Discipel løb foran, hurtigere
      end Peter, og kom først til Graven.
  5.  Og da han kiggede ind, ser han Linklæderne ligge der, men gik
      dog ikke ind.
  6.  Da kommer Simon Peter, som fulgte ham, og han gik ind i Graven
      og så Linklæderne ligge der
  7.  og Tørklædet, som han havde haft på sit Hoved, ikke liggende ved
      Linklæderne, men sammenrullet på et Sted for sig selv.
  8.  Nu gik da også den anden Discipel, som var kommen først til
      Graven, ind, og han så og troede.
  9.  Thi de forstode endnu ikke Skriften, at han skulde opstå fra de
      døde.
 10.  Da gik Disciplene atter bort til deres Hjem.

 11.  Men Maria stod udenfor ved Graven og græd. Som hun nu græd,
      kiggede hun ind i Graven,
 12.  og hun ser to Engle sidde i hvide Klæder, en ved Hovedet og en
      ved Fødderne,hvor Jesu Legeme havde ligget.
 13.  Og de sige til hende: "Kvinde! hvorfor græder du?" Hun siger til
      dem: "Fordi de have taget min Herre bort, og jeg ved ikke, hvor
      de have lagt ham."
 14.  Da hun havde sagt dette, vendte hun sig om, og hun ser Jesus stå
      der, og hun vidste ikke, at det var Jesus.
 15.  Jesus siger til hende: "Kvinde: hvorfor græder du? hvem leder du
      efter?" Hun mente, det var Havemanden, og siger til ham: "Herre!
      dersom du har båret ham bort, da sig mig, hvor du har lagt ham,
      så vil jeg tage ham."
 16.  Jesus siger til hende: "Maria!" Hun vender sig om og siger til
      ham på Hebraisk: "Rabbuni!" hvilket betyder Mester.
 17.  Jesus siger til hende: "Rør ikke ved mig, thi jeg er endnu ikke
      opfaren til min Fader; men gå til mine Brødre og sig dem: Jeg
      farer op til min Fader og eders Fader og til min Gud og eders
      Gud."
 18.  Maria Magdalene kommer og forkynder Disciplene: "Jeg har set
      Herren," og at han havde sagt hende dette.

 19.  Da det nu var Aften på den samme Dag, den første Dag i Ugen, og
      Dørene der, hvor Disciplene opholdt sig, vare lukkede af Frygt
      for Jøderne, kom Jesus og stod midt iblandt dem, og han siger
      til dem: "Fred være med eder!"
 20.  Og som han sagde dette, viste han dem sine Hænder og sin
      Side. Så bleve Disciplene glade, da de så Herren.
 21.  Jesus sagde da atter til dem: "Fred være med eder! Ligesom
      Faderen har udsendt mig, således sender også jeg eder."
 22.  Og da han havde sagt dette, åndede han på dem, og han siger til
      dem: "Modtager den Helligånd!
 23.  Hvem I forlade Synderne, dem ere de forladte, og hvem I nægte
      Forladelse, dem er den nægtet."
 24.  Men Thomas, hvilket betyder Tvilling, en af de tolv, var ikke
      hos dem, da Jesus kom.
 25.  De andre Disciple sagde da til ham: "Vi have set Herren." Men
      han sagde til dem: "Uden jeg får set Naglegabet i hans Hænder og
      stikker min Finger i Naglegabet og stikker min Hånd i hans Side,
      vil jeg ingenlunde tro."

 26.  Og otte Dage efter vare hans Disciple atter inde, og Thomas med
      dem. Jesus kommer, da Dørene vare lukkede, og han stod midt
      iblandt dem og sagde: "Fred være med eder!"
 27.  Derefter siger han til Thomas: "Ræk din Finger hid, og se mine
      Hænder, og ræk din Hånd hid, og stik den i min Side, og vær ikke
      vantro, men troende!"
 28.  Thomas svarede og sagde til ham: "Min Herre og min Gud!"
 29.  Jesus siger til ham: "Fordi du har set mig, har du troet; salige
      ere de, som ikke have set og dog troet."

 30.  Desuden gjorde Jesus mange andre Tegn for sine Disciples Åsyn,
      som ikke ere skrevne i denne Bog.
 31.  Men dette er skrevet, for at I skulle tro, at Jesus er Kristus,
      Guds Søn, og for at I, når I tro, skulle have Livet i hans Navn.

Johannes 21

  1.  Siden åbenbarede Jesus sige atter for Disciplene ved Tiberias
      Søen; men han åbenbarede sig således.
  2.  Simon Peter og Thomas, hvilket betyder Tvilling, og Nathanael
      fra Kana i Galilæa og Zebedæus's Sønner og to andre af hans,
      Disciple vare sammen.
  3.  Simon Peter siger til dem: "Jeg går ud at fiske." De sige til
      ham: "Også vi gå med dig." De gik ud og gik om Bord i Skibet, og
      den Nat fangede de intet.
  4.  Men da det nu blev Morgen, stod Jesus ved Søbredden; dog vidste
      Disciplene ikke, at det var Jesus.
  5.  Jesus siger da til dem: "Børnlille! have I noget at spise?" De
      svarede ham: "Nej."
  6.  Men han sagde til dem: "Kaster Garnet ud på højre Side af
      Skibet, så skulle I finde." Da kastede de det ud, og de formåede
      ikke mere at drage det for Fiskenes Mængde.
  7.  Den Discipel, som Jesus elskede, siger da til Peter: "Det er
      Herren." Da Simon Peter nu hørte, at det var Herren, bandt han
      sin Fiskerkjortel om sig (thi han var nøgen), og kastede sig i
      Søen.
  8.  Men de andre Disciple kom med Skibet, thi de vare ikke langt fra
      Land, kun omtrent to Hundrede Alen, og de slæbte efter sig
      Garnet med Fiskene.
  9.  Da de nu kom i Land, se de der en Kulild og Fisk ligge derpå og
      Brød.
 10.  Jesus siger til dem: "Bringer hid af de Fisk, som I nu fangede."
 11.  Simon Peter steg op og trak Garnet på Land, fuldt af store Fisk,
      et Hundrede og tre og halvtredsindstyve, og skønt de vare så
      mange, sønderreves Garnet ikke.
 12.  Jesus siger til dem: "Kommer og holder Måltid! Men, ingen af
      Disciplene vovede at spørge ham: "Hvem er du?" thi de vidste, at
      det var Herren.
 13.  Jesus kommer og tager Brødet og giver dem det, ligeledes også
      Fiskene.
 14.  Dette var allerede den tredje Gang, at Jesus åbenbarede sig for
      sine Disciple, efter at han var oprejst fra de døde.

 15.  Da de nu havde holdt Måltid, siger Jesus til Simon Peter:
      "Simon, Johannes's Søn, elsker du mig mere end disse?" Han siger
      til ham: "Ja, Herre! du ved,at jeg har dig kær." Han siger til
      ham: "Vogt mine Lam!"
 16.  Han siger atter anden Gang til ham: "Simon, Johannes's Søn,
      elsker du mig?" Han siger til ham: "Ja, Herre! du ved, at jeg
      har dig kær."  Han siger til ham: "Vær Hyrde for mine Får!"
 17.  Han siger tredje Gang til ham: "Simon, Johannes's Søn, har du
      mig kær?" Peter blev bedrøvet, fordi han tredje Gang sagde til
      ham: "Har du mig kær?" Og han sagde til ham: "Herre! du kender
      alle Ting, du ved, at jeg har dig kær." Jesus siger til ham:
      "Vogt mine Får!
 18.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg dig, da du var yngre, bandt du
      selv op om dig og gik, hvorhen du vilde; men når du bliver
      gammel, skal du udrække dine Hænder, og en anden skal binde op
      om dig og føre dig derhen, hvor du ikke vil."
 19.  Men dette sagde han for at betegne, med hvilken Død han skulde
      herliggøre Gud. Og da han havde sagt dette, siger han til ham:
      "Følg mig!"

 20.  Peter vendte sig og så den Discipel følge, som Jesus elskede, og
      som også lå op til hans Bryst ved Nadveren og sagde: "Herre!
      hvem er den, som forråder dig?"
 21.  Da nu Peter så ham, siger han til Jesus: "Herre! men hvorledes
      skal det gå denne?"
 22.  Jesus siger til ham: "Dersom jeg vil, at han skal blive, indtil
      jeg kommer, hvad vedkommer det dig? Følg du mig!"
 23.  Så kom da dette Ord ud iblandt Brødrene: "Denne Discipel dør
      ikke;" og Jesus havde dog ikke sagt til ham, at han ikke skulde
      dø, men: "Dersom jeg vil, at han skal blive, indtil jeg kommer,
      hvad vedkommer det dig?"
 24.  Dette er den Discipel, som vidner om disse Ting og har skrevet
      dette; og vi vide, at hans Vidnesbyrd er sandt.

 25.  Men der er også mange andre Ting, som Jesus har gjort, og dersom
      de skulde skrives enkeltvis. mener jeg, at ikke hele Verden
      kunde rumme de Bøger, som da bleve skrevne.


Apostelenes gerninger

Apostelenes gerninger 1

  1.  Den første Bog skrev jeg, o Theofilus! om alt det, som Jesus
      begyndte både at gøre og lære,
  2.  indtil den Dag, da han blev optagen, efter at han havde givet
      Apostlene, som han havde udvalgt, Befaling ved den Helligånd;
  3.  for hvem han også, efter at han havde lidt, fremstillede sig
      levende ved mange Beviser, idet han viste sig for dem i
      fyrretyve Dage og talte om de Ting, der høre til Guds Rige.
  4.  Og medens han var sammen med dem, bød han dem, at de ikke måtte
      vige fra Jerusalem, men skulde oppebie Faderens Forjættelse,
      "hvorom," sagde han, "I have hørt af mig.
  5.  Thi Johannes døbte med Vand; men I skulle døbes med den
      Helligånd om ikke mange Dage."
  6.  Som de nu vare forsamlede, spurgte de ham og sagde: "Herre!
      opretter du på denne Tid Riget igen for Israel?"
  7.  Men han sagde til dem: "Det tilkommer ikke eder at kende Tider
      eller Timer, hvilke Faderen har fastsat i sin egen Magt.
  8.  Men I skulle få Kraft, når den Helligånd kommer over eder; og I
      skulle være mine Vidner både i Jerusalem og i hele Judæa og
      Samaria og indtil Jordens Ende."
  9.  Og da han havde sagt dette, blev han optagen, medens de så
      derpå, og en Sky tog ham bort fra deres Øjne.
 10.  Og som de stirrede op imod Himmelen, medens han for bort, se, da
      stode to Mænd hos dem i hvide Klæder,
 11.  og de sagde: "I galilæiske Mænd, hvorfor stå I og se op imod
      Himmelen? Denne Jesus, som er optagen fra eder til Himmelen,
      skal komme igen på samme Måde, som I have set ham fare til
      Himmelen."

 12.  Da vendte de tilbage til Jerusalem fra det Bjerg, som kaldes
      Oliebjerget og er nær ved Jerusalem, en Sabbatsvej derfra.
 13.  Og da de kom derind, gik de op på den Sal, hvor de plejede at
      opholde sig, Peter og Johannes og Jakob og Andreas, Filip og
      Thomas, Bartholomæus og Matthæus, Jakob, Alfæus's Søn og Simon
      Zelotes, og Judas, Jakobs Søn.
 14.  Alle disse vare endrægtigt vedholdende i Bønnen tillige med
      nogle Kvinder og Maria, Jesu Moder, og med hans Brødre.
 15.  Og i disse Dage stod Peter op midt iblandt Brødrene og sagde:
      (og der var en Skare samlet på omtrent hundrede og tyve
      Personer):
 16.  "I Mænd, Brødre! det Skriftens Ord burde opfyldes, som den
      Helligånd forud havde talt ved Davids Mund om Judas, der blev
      Vejleder for dem, som grebe Jesus;
 17.  thi han var regnet iblandt os og havde fået denne Tjenestes Lod.
 18.  Han erhvervede sig nu en Ager for sin Uretfærdigheds Løn, og han
      styrtede ned og brast itu, og alle hans Indvolde væltede ud,
 19.  hvilket også er blevet vitterligt for alle dem, som bo i
      Jerusalem, så at den Ager kaldes på deres eget Mål Hakeldama,
      det er Blodager.
 20.  Thi der er skrevet i Salmernes Bog: "Hans Bolig blive øde, og
      der være ingen, som bor i den," og: "Lad en anden få hans
      Tilsynsgerning."
 21.  Derfor bør en af de Mænd, som vare sammen med os i hele den Tid,
      da den Herre Jesus gik ind og gik ud hos os,
 22.  lige fra Johannes's Dåb indtil den Dag, da han blev optagen fra
      os, blive Vidne sammen med os om hans Opstandelse."
 23.  Og de fremstillede to, Josef, som kaldtes Barsabbas med Tilnavn
      Justus, og Matthias.
 24.  Og de bade og sagde: "Du Herre! som kender alles Hjerter, vis os
      den ene, som du har udvalgt af disse to
 25.  til at få denne Tjenestes og Apostelgernings Plads, som Judas
      forlod for at gå hen til sit eget Sted."
 26.  Og de kastede Lod imellem dem, og Loddet faldt på Matthias. og
      han blev regnet sammen med de elleve Apostle.

Apostelenes gerninger 2

  1.  Og da Pinsefestens Dag kom, vare de alle endrægtigt forsamlede.
  2.  Og der kom pludseligt fra Himmelen en Lyd som af et fremfarende
      vældigt Vejr og fyldte hele Huset, hvor de sade.
  3.  Og der viste sig for dem Tunger som af Ild, der fordelte sig og
      satte sig på hver enkelt af dem.
  4.  Og de bleve alle fyldte med den Helligånd, og de begyndte at
      tale i andre Tungemål, efter hvad Ånden gav dem at udsige.
  5.  Men der var Jøder, bosiddende i Jerusalem, gudfrygtige Mænd af
      alle Folkeslag under Himmelen.
  6.  Da denne Lyd kom, strømmede Mængden sammen og blev forvirret;
      thi hver enkelt hørte dem tale på hans eget Mål.
  7.  Og de forbavsedes alle og undrede sig og sagde: "Se, ere ikke
      alle disse, som tale, Galilæere?
  8.  Hvor kunne vi da høre dem tale, hver på vort eget Mål, hvor vi
      ere fødte,
  9.  Parthere og Medere og Elamiter, og vi, som høre hjemme i
      Mesopotamien, Judæa og Happadokien. Pontus og Asien,
 10.  i Frygien og Pamfylien, Ægypten og Libyens Egne ved Kyrene, og
      vi her boende Romere,
 11.  Jøder og Proselyter, Kretere og Arabere, vi høre dem tale om
      Guds store Gerninger i vore Tungemål?"
 12.  Og de forbavsedes alle og,vare tvivlrådige og sagde den ene til
      den anden: "Hvad kan dette være?"
 13.  Men andre sagde spottende: "De ere fulde af sød Vin."

 14.  Da stod Peter frem med de elleve og opløftede sin Røst og talte
      til dem: "I jødiske Mænd og alle I, som bo i Jerusalem! dette
      være eder vitterligt, og låner Øre til mine Ord!
 15.  Thi disse ere ikke drukne, som I mene; det er jo den tredje Time
      på Dagen;
 16.  men dette er, hvad der et sagt ved Profeten Joel:
 17.  "Og det skal ske i de sidste Dage, siger Gud, da vil jeg udgyde
      af min Ånd over alt Kød; og eders Sønner og eders Døtre skulle
      profetere, og de unge iblandt eder skulle se Syner, og de gamle
      iblandt eder skulle have Drømme.
 18.  Ja, endog over mine Trælle og over mine Trælkvinder vil jeg i de
      Dage udgyde af min Ånd, og de skulle profetere.
 19.  Og jeg vil lade ske Undere på Himmelen oventil og Tegn på Jorden
      nedentil, Blod og Ild og rygende Damp.
 20.  Solen skal forvandles til Mørke og Månen til Blod, førend
      Herrens store og herlige Dag kommer.
 21.  Og det skal ske, enhver, som påkalder Herrens Navn, skal
      frelses."
 22.  I israelitiske Mænd! hører disse Ord: Jesus af Nazareth, en
      Mand, som fra Gud var godtgjort for eder ved kraftige Gerninger
      og Undere og Tegn, hvilke Gud gjorde ved ham midt iblandt eder,
      som I jo selv vide,
 23.  ham, som efter Guds bestemte Rådslutning og Forudviden var
      bleven forrådt, ham have I ved lovløses Hånd korsfæstet og
      ihjelslået.
 24.  Men Gud oprejste ham, idet han gjorde Ende på Dødens Veer,
      eftersom det ikke var muligt, at han kunde fastholdes af den.
 25.  Thi David siger med Henblik på ham: "Jeg havde altid Herren for
      mine Øjne; thi han er ved min højre Hånd, for at jeg ikke skal
      rokkes,
 26.  Derfor glædede mit Hjerte sig, og min Tunge jublede, ja, også
      mit Kød skal bo i Håb;
 27.  thi du skal ikke lade min Sjæl tilbage i Dødsriget, ikke heller
      tilstede din hellige at se Forrådnelse,
 28.  Du har kundgjort mig Livets Veje; du skal fylde mig med Glæde
      for dit Åsyn."
 29.  I Mænd Brødre! Jeg kan sige med Frimodighed til eder om
      Patriarken David, at han er både død og begraven, og hans Grav
      er hos os indtil denne Dag.
 30.  Da han nu var en Profet og vidste, at Gud med Ed havde tilsvoret
      ham, at af hans Lænds Frugt skulde en sidde på hans Trone,
 31.  talte han, forudseende, om Kristi Opstandelse, at hverken blev
      han ladt tilbage i Dødsriget, ej heller så hans Kød Forrådnelse.
 32.  Denne Jesus oprejste Gud, hvorom vi alle ere Vidner.
 33.  Efter at han nu ved Guds højre Hånd er ophøjet og af Faderen har
      fået den Helligånds Forjættelse, har han udgydt denne, hvilket I
      både se og høre.
 34.  Thi David for ikke op til Himmelen; men han siger selv: "Herren
      sagde til min Herre: Sæt dig ved min højre Hånd,
 35.  indtil jeg får lagt dine Fjender som en Skammel for dine
      Fødder."
 36.  Derfor skal hele Israels Hus vide for vist, at denne Jesus, hvem
      I korsfæstede, har Gud gjort både til Herre og til Kristus,"

 37.  Men da de hørte dette, stak det dem i Hjertet, og de sagde til
      Peter og de øvrige Apostle: "I Mænd, Brødre! hvad skulle vi
      gøre?"
 38.  Men Peter sagde til dem: "Omvender eder, og hver af eder lade
      sig døbe på Jesu Kristi Navn til eders Synders Forladelse; og I
      skulle få den Helligånds Gave.
 39.  Thi for eder er Forjættelsen og for eders Børn og for alle dem,
      som ere langt borte, så mange som Herren vor Gud vil tilkalde."
 40.  Også med mange andre Ord vidnede han for dem og format dem, idet
      han sagde: "Lader eder frelse fra denne vanartede Slægt!"
 41.  De, som nu toge imod hans Ord, bleve døbte; og der føjedes samme
      Dag omtrent tre Tusinde Sjæle til.

 42.  Og de holdt fast ved Apostlenes Lære og Samfundet, Brødets
      Brydelse og Bønnerne.
 43.  Men der kom Frygt over en hver Sjæl, og der skete mange Undere
      og Tegn ved Apostlene.
 44.  Og alle de troende holdt sig sammen og havde alle Ting fælles.
 45.  Og de solgte deres Ejendom og Gods og delte det ud iblandt alle,
      efter hvad enhver havde Trang til.
 46.  Og idet de hver Dag vedholdende og endrægtigt kom i Helligdommen
      og brød Brødet hjemme, fik de deres Føde med Fryd og i Hjertets
      Enfold,
 47.  idet de lovede Gud og havde Yndest hos hele Folket. Men Herren
      føjede daglig til dem nogle, som lode sig frelse.

Apostelenes gerninger 3

  1.  Men Peter og Johannes gik op i Helligdommen ved Bedetimen, den
      niende Time.
  2.  Og en Mand, som var lam fra Moders Liv af, blev båren frem; ham
      satte de daglig ved den Dør til Helligdommen, som kaldtes den
      skønne, for at han kunde bede dem, som gik ind i Helligdommen,
      om Almisse.
  3.  Da han så Peter og Johannes, idet de vilde gå ind i
      Helligdommen, bad han om at få en Almisse.
  4.  Da så Peter tillige med Johannes fast på ham og sagde: "Se på
      os!"
  5.  Og han gav Agt på dem, efterdi han ventede at få noget af dem.
  6.  Men Peter sagde: "Sølv og Guld ejer jeg ikke, men hvad jeg har,
      det giver jeg dig: I Jesu Kristi Nazaræerens Navn stå op og gå!"
  7.  Og han greb ham ved den højre Hånd og rejste ham op.
  8.  Men straks bleve hans Ben og Ankler stærke, og han sprang op og
      stod og gik omkring og gik med dem ind i Helligdommen, hvor han
      gik omkring og sprang og lovede Gud.
  9.  Og hele Folket så ham gå omkring og love Gud.
 10.  Og de kendte ham som den, der havde siddet ved den skønne Port
      til Helligdommen for at få Almisse; og de bleve fulde af Rædsel
      og Forfærdelse over det, som var timedes ham.
 11.  Medens han nu holdt fast ved Peter og Johannes, løb alt Folket
      rædselsslagent sammen om dem i den Søjlegang, som kaldes
      Salomons.

 12.  Men da Peter så det, talte han til Folket: "I israelitiske Mænd!
      Hvorfor undre I eder over dette? eller hvorfor stirre I på os,
      som om vi af egen Magt eller Gudfrygtighed havde gjort, at han
      kan gå?
 13.  Abrahams og Isaks og Jakobs Gud, vore Fædres Gud, har
      herliggjort sin Tjener" Jesus, hvem I prisgave og fornægtede for
      Pilatus, da han dømte, at han skulde løslades.
 14.  Men I fornægtede den hellige og retfærdige og bade om, at en
      Morder måtte skænkes eder.
 15.  Men Livets Fyrste sloge I ihjel, hvem Gud oprejste fra de døde,
      hvorom vi ere Vidner.
 16.  Og i Troen på hans Navn har hans Navn styrket denne, hvem I se
      og kende, og Troen, som virkedes ved ham, har givet denne hans
      Førlighed i Påsyn af eder alle.
 17.  Og nu, Brødre! jeg ved, at I handlede i Uvidenhed, ligesom også
      eders Rådsherrer.
 18.  Men Gud har således fuldbyrdet, hvad han forud forkyndte ved
      alle Profeternes Mund, at hans Salvede skulde lide.
 19.  Derfor fatter et andet Sind og vender om, for at eders Synder må
      blive udslettede, for at Vederkvægelsens Tider må komme fra
      Herrens Åsyn,
 20.  og han må sende den for eder bestemte Kristus, Jesus,
 21.  hvem Himmelen skal modtage indtil alle Tings Genoprettelses
      Tider, hvorom Gud har talt ved sine hellige Profeters Mund fra
      de ældste Dage.
 22.  Moses sagde: "En Profet skal Herren eders Gud oprejse eder af
      eders Brødre ligesom mig; ham skulle I høre i alt, hvad han end
      vil tale til eder.
 23.  Men det skal ske, hver Sjæl, som ikke hører den Profet, skal
      udryddes af Folket."
 24.  Men også alle Profeterne, fra Samuel af og derefter, så mange
      som talte, have også forkyndt disse Dage.
 25.  I ere Profeternes Sønner og Sønner af den Pagt, som Gud sluttede
      med vore Fædre, da han sagde til Abraham: "Og i din Sæd skulle
      alle Jordens Slægter velsignes."
 26.  For eder først har Gud oprejst sin Tjener og sendt han for at
      velsigne eder, når enhver af eder vender om fra sin Ondskab."

Apostelenes gerninger 4

  1.  Men medens de talte til Folket, kom Præsterne og Høvedsmanden
      for Helligdommen og Saddukæerne over dem,
  2.  da de harmedes over, at de lærte Folket og i Jesus forkyndte
      Opstandelsen fra de døde.
  3.  Og de lagde Hånd på dem og satte dem i Forvaring til den
      følgende Dag; thi det var allerede Aften.
  4.  Men mange af dem, som havde hørt Ordet, troede, og Tallet på
      Mændene blev omtrent fem Tusinde.
  5.  Men det skete Dagen derefter, at deres Rådsherrer og Ældste og
      skriftkloge forsamlede sig i Jerusalem,
  6.  ligeså Ypperstepræsten Annas og Kajfas og Johannes og Alexander
      og alle, som vare af ypperstepræstelig Slægt.
  7.  Og de stillede dem midt iblandt sig og spurgte: "Af hvad Magt
      eller i hvilket Navn have I gjort dette?"
  8.  Da sagde Peter, fyldt med den Helligånd, til dem: "I Folkets
      Rådsherrer og Ældste!
  9.  Når vi i Dag forhøres angående denne Velgerning imod en vanfør
      Mand, om hvorved han er bleven helbredt;
 10.  da skal det være eder alle og hele Israels Folk vitterligt, at
      ved Jesu Kristi Nazaræerens Navn, hvem I have korsfæstet, hvem
      Gud har oprejst fra de døde, ved dette Navn er det, at denne
      står rask her for eders Øjne,
 11.  Han er den Sten, som blev agtet for intet af eder, I
      Bygningsmænd, men som er bleven til en Hovedhjørnesten.
 12.  Og der er ikke Frelse i nogen anden; thi der er ikke noget andet
      Navn under Himmelen, givet iblandt Mennesker, ved hvilket vi
      skulle blive frelste."
 13.  Men da de så Peters og Johannes Frimodighed og kunde mærke, at
      de vare ulærde Mænd og Lægfolk, forundrede de sig, og de kendte
      dem, at de havde været med Jesus.
 14.  Og da de så Manden, som var helbredt, stå hos dem, havde de
      intet at sige derimod.
 15.  Men de bøde dem at træde ud fra Rådet og rådførte sig med
      hverandre og sagde:
 16.  "Hvad skulle vi gøre med disse Mennesker? thi at et vitterligt
      Tegn er sket ved dem, det er åbenbart for alle dem, som bo i
      Jerusalem, og vi kunne ikke nægte det.
 17.  Men for at det ikke skal komme videre ud iblandt Folket, da
      lader os true dem til ikke mere at tale til noget Menneske i
      dette Navn."
 18.  Og de kaldte dem ind og forbøde dem aldeles at tale eller lære i
      Jesu Navn.
 19.  Men Peter og Johannes svarede og sagde til dem: "Dømmer selv. om
      det er ret for Gud at lyde eder mere end Gud.
 20.  Thi vi kunne ikke lade være at tale om det, som vi have set og
      hørt."
 21.  Men de truede dem end mere og løslode dem, da de ikke kunde
      udfinde, hvorledes de skulde straffe dem, for Folkets Skyld; thi
      alle priste Gud for det, som var sket.
 22.  Thi den Mand, på hvem dette Helbredelsestegn var sket, var mere
      end fyrretyve År gammel.

 23.  Da de nu vare løsladte, kom de til deres egne og fortalte dem
      alt, hvad Ypperstepræsterne og de Ældste havde sagt til dem.
 24.  Men da de hørte dette, opløftede de endrægtigt Røsten til Gud og
      sagde: "Herre, du, som har gjort Himmelen og Jorden og Havet og
      alle Ting, som ere i dem,
 25.  du, som har sagt ved din Tjener Davids Mund: "Hvorfor fnyste
      Hedninger, og Folkeslag oplagde forfængelige Råd?
 26.  Jordens Konger rejste sig, og Fyrsterne samlede sig til Hobe
      imod Herren og imod hans Salvede."
 27.  Ja, de have i Sandhed forsamlet sig i denne Stad imod din
      hellige Tjener Jesus, hvem du har salvet, både Herodes og
      Pontius Pilatus tillige med Hedningerne og Israels Folkestammer
 28.  for at gøre det, som din Hånd og dit Råd forud havde bestemt
      skulde ske.
 29.  Og nu, Herre! se til deres Trusler, og giv dine Tjenere at tale
      dit Ord med al Frimodighed,
 30.  idet du udrækker din Hånd til Helbredelse, og der sker Tegn og
      Undere ved din hellige Tjeners Jesu Navn."
 31.  Og da de havde bedt, rystedes Stedet, hvor de vare forsamlede;
      og de bleve alle fyldte med den Helligånd, og de talte Guds Ord
      med Frimodighed.
 32.  Men de troendes Mængde havde eet Hjerte og een Sjæl; og end ikke
      een kaldte noget af det, han ejede, sit eget; men de havde alle
      Ting fælles.
 33.  Og med stor Kraft aflagde Apostlene Vidnesbyrdet om den Herres
      Jesu Opstandelse, og der var stor Nåde over dem alle.
 34.  Thi der var end ikke nogen trængende iblandt dem; thi alle de,
      som vare Ejere af Jordstykker eller Huse, solgte dem og bragte
      Salgssummerne
 35.  og lagde dem for Apostlenes Fødder; men der blev uddelt til
      enhver, efter hvad han havde Trang til.
 36.  Og Josef, som af Apostlene fik Tilnavnet Barnabas, (det er
      udlagt: Trøstens Søn), en Levit, født på Kypern
 37.  som ejede en Jordlod, solgte den og bragte Pengene og lagde dem
      for Apostlenes Fødder.

Apostelenes gerninger 5

  1.  Men en Mand, ved Navn Ananias, tillige med Safira, hans Hustru,
      solgte en Ejendom
  2.  og stak med sin Hustrus Vidende noget af Værdien til Side og
      bragte en Del deraf og lagde den for Apostlenes Fødder.
  3.  Men Peter sagde: "Ananias! hvorfor har Satan fyldt dit Hjerte,
      så du har løjet imod den Helligånd og stukket noget til Side af
      Summen for Jordstykket?
  4.  Var det ikke dit, så længe du ejede det, og stod ikke det, som
      det blev solgt for, til din Rådighed? Hvorfor har du dog sat dig
      denne Gerning for i dit Hjerte? Du har ikke løjet for Mennesker,
      men for Gud."
  5.  Men da Ananias hørte disse Ord, faldt han om og udåndede. Og der
      kom stor Frygt over alle, som hørte det.
  6.  Men de unge Mænd stode op og lagde ham til Rette og bare ham ud
      og begravede ham.
  7.  Men det skete omtrent tre Timer derefter, da kom hans Hustru ind
      uden at vide, hvad der var sket.
  8.  Da sagde Peter til hende: "Sig mig, om I solgte Jordstykket til
      den Pris?" Og hun sagde: "Ja, til den Pris."
  9.  Men Peter sagde til hende: "Hvorfor ere I dog blevne enige om at
      friste Herrens Ånd? Se, deres Fødder, som have begravet din
      Mand, ere for Døren, og de skulle bære dig ud."
 10.  Men hun faldt straks om for hans Fødder og udåndede. Men da de
      unge Mænd kom ind, fandt de hende død, og de bare hende ud og
      begravede hende hos hendes Mand.
 11.  Og stor Frygt kom over hele Menigheden og over alle, som hørte
      dette.

 12.  Men ved Apostlenes Hænder skete der mange Tegn og Undere iblandt
      Folket; og de vare alle endrægtigt sammen i Salomons Søjlegang.
 13.  Men af de andre turde ingen holde sig til dem; dog priste Folket
      dem højt,
 14.  og der føjedes stedse flere troende til Herren, Skarer både af
      Mænd og Kvinder,
 15.  så at de endogså bare de syge ud på Gaderne og lagde dem på
      Senge og Løjbænke, for at når Peter kom, endog blot hans Skygge
      kunde overskygge nogen af dem.
 16.  Ja, selv fra Byerne i Jerusalems Omegn strømmede Mængden sammen
      og bragte syge og sådanne, som vare plagede af urene Ånder, og
      de bleve alle helbredte.

 17.  Men Ypperstepræsten stod op samt alle de, som holdt med ham,
      nemlig Saddukæernes Parti, og de bleve fulde af Nidkærhed.
 18.  Og de lagde Hånd på Apostlene og satte dem i offentlig
      Forvaring.
 19.  Men en Herrens Engel åbnede Fængselets Døre om Natten og førte
      dem ud og sagde:
 20.  "Går hen og træder frem og taler i Helligdommen alle disse
      Livets Ord for Folket!"
 21.  Men da de havde hørt dette, gik de ved Daggry ind i Helligdommen
      og lærte. Men Ypperstepræsten og de, som holdt med ham, kom og
      sammenkaldte Rådet og alle Israels Børns Ældste og sendte Bud
      til Fængselet, at de skulde føres frem.
 22.  Men da Tjenerne kom derhen, fandt de dem ikke i Fængselet; og de
      kom tilbage og meldte det og sagde:
 23.  "Fængselet fandt vi tillukket helt forsvarligt, og Vogterne
      stående ved Dørene; men da vi lukkede op, fandt vi ingen
      derinde."
 24.  Men da Høvedsmanden for Helligdommen og Ypperstepræsterne hørte
      disse Ord, bleve de tvivlrådige om dem,hvad dette skulde blive
      til.
 25.  Men der kom en og meldte dem: "Se, de Mænd, som I satte i
      Fængselet, stå i Helligdommen og lære Folket."
 26.  Da gik Høvedsmanden hen med Tjenerne og hentede dem, dog ikke
      med Magt; thi de frygtede for Folket, at de skulde blive
      stenede.
 27.  Men da de havde hentet dem, stillede de dem for Rådet; og
      Ypperstepræsten spurgte dem og sagde:
 28.  "Vi bøde eder alvorligt, at I ikke måtte lære i dette Navn, og
      se, I have fyldt Jerusalem med eders Lære, og I ville bringe
      dette Menneskes Blod over os!"
 29.  Men Peter og Apostlene svarede og sagde: "Man bør adlyde Gud
      mere end Mennesker.
 30.  Vore Fædres Gud oprejste Jesus, hvem I hængte på et Træ og sloge
      ihjel.
 31.  Ham har Gud ved sin højre Hånd ophøjet til en Fyrste og Frelser
      for at give Israel Omvendelse og Syndernes Forladelse.
 32.  Og vi ere hans Vidner om disse Ting, ligesom også den Helligånd,
      som Gud har givet dem, der adlyde ham."

 33.  Men da de hørte dette, skar det dem i Hjertet, og de rådsloge om
      at slå dem ihjel.
 34.  Men der rejste sig i Rådet en Farisæer ved Navn Gamaliel, en
      Lovlærer, højt agtet af hele Folket, og han bød, at de skulde
      lade Mændene træde lidt udenfor.
 35.  Og han sagde til dem: "I israelitiske Mænd! ser eder vel for,
      hvad I gøre med disse Mennesker.
 36.  Thi for nogen Tid siden fremstod Theudas, som udgav sig selv for
      at være noget, og et Antal af omtrent fire Hundrede Mænd
      sluttede sig til ham; han blev slået ihjel, og alle de, som
      adløde ham, adsplittedes og bleve til intet.
 37.  Efter ham fremstod Judas Galilæeren i Skatteindskrivningens Dage
      og fik en Flok Mennesker til at følge sig. Også han omkom, og
      alle de, som adløde ham, bleve adspredte.
 38.  Og nu siger jeg eder: Holder eder fra disse Mennesker, og lader
      dem fare; thi dersom dette Råd eller dette Værk er af Mennesker,
      bliver det til intet;
 39.  men er det af Gud, kunne I ikke gøre dem til intet. Lader eder
      dog ikke findes som de, der endog ville stride mod Gud!"

 40.  Og de adløde ham; og de kaldte Apostlene frem og lode dem piske
      og forbøde dem at tale i Jesu Navn og løslode dem.
 41.  Så gik de da glade bort fra Rådets Åsyn, fordi de vare blevne
      agtede værdige til at vanæres for hans Navns Skyld.
 42.  Og de holdt ikke op med hver Dag at lære i Helligdommen og i
      Husene og at forkynde Evangeliet om Kristus Jesus.

Apostelenes gerninger 6

  1.  Men da i de Dage Disciplenes Antal forøgedes, begyndte
      Hellenisterne at knurre imod Hebræerne", fordi deres Enker bleve
      tilsidesatte ved den daglige Uddeling.
  2.  Da sammenkaldte de tolv Disciplenes Skare og sagde: "Det huer os
      ikke at forlade Guds Ord for at tjene ved Bordene.
  3.  Udser derfor, Brødre! iblandt eder syv Mænd, som have godt
      Vidnesbyrd og ere fulde af Ånd og Visdom; dem ville vi så
      indsætte til denne Gerning.
  4.  Men vi ville holde trolig ved i Bønnen og Ordets Tjeneste."
  5.  Og denne Tale behagede hele Mængden; og de udvalgte Stefanus. en
      Mand fuld af Tro og den Helligånd, og Filip og Prokorus og
      Nikaiior og Timon og Parmenas og Nikolaus, en Proselyt fra
      Antiokia;
  6.  dem stillede de frem for Apostlene; og disse bade og lagde
      Hænderne på dem.

  7.  Og Guds Ord havde Fremgang og Disciplenes Tal forøgedes meget i
      Jerusalem; og en stor Mængde af Præsterne adløde Troen.

  8.  Men Stefanus, fuld af Nåde og Kraft, gjorde Undere og store Tegn
      iblandt Folket,
  9.  Da stod der nogle frem af den Synagoge, som kaldes de frigivnes
      og Kyrenæernes og Aleksandrinernes, og nogle af dem fra Kilikien
      og Asien, og de tvistedes med Stefanus.
 10.  Og de kunde ikke modstå den Visdom og den Ånd, som han talte af.
 11.  Da fik de hemmeligt nogle Mænd til at sige: "Vi have hørt ham
      tale bespottelige Ord imod Moses og imod Gud."
 12.  Og de ophidsede Folket og de Ældste og de skriftkloge, og de
      overfaldt ham og slæbte ham med sig og førte ham for Rådet;
 13.  og de fremstillede falske Vidner, som sagde: "Dette Menneske
      holder ikke op med at tale Ord imod dette hellige Sted og imod
      Loven.
 14.  Thi vi have hørt ham sige, at denne Jesus af Nazareth skal
      nedbryde dette Sted og forandre de Skikke, som Moses har
      overgivet os."
 15.  Og alle de, som sade i Rådet, stirrede på ham, og de så hans
      Ansigt som en Engels Ansigt.

Apostelenes gerninger 7

  1.  Men Ypperstepræsten sagde: "Forholder dette sig således?"
  2.  Men han sagde: "I Mænd, Brødre og Fædre, hører til! Herlighedens
      Gud viste sig for vor Fader Abraham, da han var i Mesopotamien,
      førend han tog Bolig i Karan.
  3.  Og han sagde til ham: "Gå ud af dit Land og fra din Slægt, og
      kom til det Land, som jeg vil vise dig."
  4.  Da gik han ud fra Kaldæernes Land og tog Bolig i Karan; og efter
      hans Faders Død lod Gud ham flytte derfra hen i dette Land, hvor
      I nu bo.
  5.  Og han gav ham ikke Ejendom deri, end ikke en Fodsbred; dog
      forjættede han ham at give ham det til Eje og hans Sæd efter
      ham, endskønt han intet Barn havde.
  6.  Men Gud talte således: "Hans Sæd skal være Udlændinge i et
      fremmed Land, og man skal gøre dem til Trælle og handle ilde med
      dem i fire Hundrede År.
  7.  Og det Folk, for hvilket de skulle trælle, vil jeg dømme, sagde
      Gud; og derefter skulle de drage ud og tjene mig på dette Sted."
  8.  Og han gav ham Omskærelsens Pagt. Og så avlede han Isak og
      omskar ham den ottende Dag, og Isak avlede Jakob, og Jakob de
      tolv Patriarker.
  9.  Og Patriarkerne bare Avind imod Josef og solgte ham til Ægypten;
      og Gud var med ham,
 10.  og han udfriede ham af alle hans Trængsler og gav ham Nåde og
      Visdom for Farao, Kongen i Ægypten, som satte ham til Øverste
      over Ægypten og over hele sit Hus.
 11.  Men der kom Hungersnød over hele Ægypten og Kanån og en stor
      Trængsel, og vore Fædre fandt ikke Føde.
 12.  Men da Jakob hørte, at der var Korn i Ægypten, sendte han vore
      Fædre ud første Gang.
 13.  Og anden Gang blev Josef genkendt af sine Brødre, og Josefs
      Herkomst blev åbenbar for Farao.
 14.  Men Josef sendte Bud og lod sin Fader Jakob og al sin Slægt
      kalde til sig, fem og halvfjerdsindstyve Sjæle.
 15.  Og Jakob drog ned til Ægypten. Og han og vore Fædre døde,
 16.  og de bleve flyttede til Sikem og lagte i den Grav, som Abraham
      havde købt for en Sum Penge af Hemors Sønner i Sikem.
 17.  Som nu Tiden nærmede sig for den Forjættelse, Gud havde tilsagt
      Abraham, voksede Folket og formeredes i Ægypten,
 18.  indtil der fremstod en anden Konge, som ikke kendte Josef.
 19.  Han viste Træskhed imod vor Slægt og handlede ilde med vore
      Fædre, så de måtte sætte deres små Børn ud, for at de ikke
      skulde holdes i Live.
 20.  På den Tid blev Moses født, og han var dejlig for Gud; han blev
      opfostret i tre Måneder i sin Faders Hus.
 21.  Men da han var sat ud, tog Faraos Datter ham op og opfostrede
      ham til sin Søn.
 22.  Og Moses blev oplært i al Ægypternes Visdom; og han var mægtig i
      sine Ord og Gerninger.
 23.  Men da han blev fyrretyve År gammel, fik han i Sinde at besøge
      sine Brødre, Israels Børn.
 24.  Og da han så en lide Uret, forsvarede han ham og hævnede den
      mishandlede, idet han slog Ægypteren ihjel.
 25.  Men han mente, at hans Brødre forstode, at Gud gav dem Frelse
      ved hans Hånd; men de forstode det ikke.
 26.  Og den næste Dag viste han sig iblandt dem under en Strid og
      vilde forlige dem til at holde Fred, sigende: "I Mænd! I ere
      Brødre, hvorfor gøre I hinanden Uret?"
 27.  Men den, som gjorde sin Næste Uret, stødte ham fra sig og sagde:
      "Hvem har sat dig til Hersker og Dommer over os?
 28.  Vil du slå mig ihjel, ligesom du i Går slog Ægypteren ihjel?"
 29.  Da flygtede Moses for denne Tales Skyld og boede som fremmed i
      Midians Land, hvor han avlede to Sønner.
 30.  Og efter fyrretyve Års Forløb viste en Engel sig for ham i Sinai
      Bjergs Ørken i en Tornebusk, der stod i lys Lue.
 31.  Men da Moses så det, undrede han sig over Synet, og da han gik
      hen for at betragte det, lød Herrens Røst til ham:
 32.  "Jeg er dine Fædres Gud, Abrahams og Isaks og Jakobs Gud." Da
      bævede Moses og turde ikke se derhen.
 33.  Men Herren sagde til ham: "Løs Skoene af dine Fødder; thi det
      Sted, som du står på, er hellig Jord.
 34.  Jeg har grant set mit Folks Mishandling i Ægypten og hørt deres
      Suk, og jeg er stegen ned for at udfri dem; og nu kom, lad mig
      sende dig til Ægypten!"
 35.  Denne Moses, hvem de fornægtede, idet de sagde: "Hvem har sat
      dig til Hersker og Dommer," ham har Gud sendt til at være både
      Hersker og Befrier ved den Engels Hånd,som viste sig for ham i
      Tornebusken.
 36.  Ham var det, som førte dem ud,idet han gjorde Undere og Tegn i
      Ægyptens Land og i det røde Hav og i Ørkenen i fyrretyve År.
 37.  Han er den Moses, som sagde til Israels Børn: "En Profet skal
      Gud oprejse eder af eders Brødre ligesom mig."
 38.  Han er den, som i Menigheden i Ørkenen færdedes med Engelen, der
      talte til ham på Sinai Bjerg, og med vore Fædre; den, som modtog
      levende Ord at give os;
 39.  hvem vore Fædre ikke vilde adlyde, men de stødte ham fra sig og
      vendte sig med deres Hjerter til Ægypten, idet de sagde til
      Aron:
 40.  "Gør os Guder, som kunne gå foran os; thi vi vide ikke, hvad der
      er sket med denne Moses, som førte os ud af Ægyptens Land."
 41.  Og de gjorde en Kalv i de Dage og bragte Offer til Gudebilledet
      og frydede sig ved deres Hænders Gerninger.
 42.  Men Gud vendte sig fra dem og gav dem hen til at tjene Himmelens
      Hær, som der er skrevet i Profeternes Bog: "Have I vel, Israels
      Hus!  bragt mig Slagtofre og andre Ofre i fyrretyve År i
      Ørkenen?
 43.  Og I bare Moloks Telt og Guden Remfans Stjerne, de Billeder, som
      I havde gjort for at tilbede dem; og jeg vil flytte eder bort
      hinsides Babylon."
 44.  Vore Fædre i Ørkenen havde Vidnesbyrdets Tabernakel, således som
      han, der talte til Moses, havde befalet at gøre det efter det
      Forbillede, som han havde set.
 45.  Dette toge også vore Fædre i Arv og bragte det under Josva ind i
      Landet, som Hedningerne besade, hvilke Gud fordrev fra vore
      Fædres Åsyn indtil Davids Dage,
 46.  som vandt Nåde for Gud og bad om at måtte finde en Bolig for
      Jakobs Gud.
 47.  Men Salomon byggede ham et Hus.
 48.  Dog, den Højeste bor ikke i Huse gjorte med Hænder, som Profeten
      siger:
 49.  "Himmelen er min Trone, og Jorden mine Fødders Skammel, hvad Hus
      ville I bygge mig? siger Herren, eller hvilket er min Hviles
      Sted?
 50.  Har ikke min Hånd gjort alt dette?"
 51.  I hårde Halse og uomskårne på Hjerter og Øren! I stå altid den
      Helligånd imod; som eders Fædre, således også I.
 52.  Hvem af Profeterne er der, som eders Fædre ikke have forfulgt?
      og de ihjelsloge dem, som forud forkyndte om den retfærdiges
      Komme, hvis Forrædere og Mordere I nu ere blevne,
 53.  I, som modtoge Loven under Engles Besørgelse og have ikke holdt
      den!"

 54.  Men da de hørte dette, skar det dem i deres Hjerter, og de bede
      Tænderne sammen imod ham.
 55.  Men som han var fuld af den Helligånd, stirrede han op imod
      Himmelen og så Guds Herlighed og Jesus stående ved Guds højre
      Hånd.
 56.  Og han sagde: "Se, jeg ser Himlene åbnede og Menneskesønnen
      stående ved Guds højre Hånd."
 57.  Men de råbte med høj Røst og holdt for deres Øren og stormede
      endrægtigt ind på ham.
 58.  Og de stødte ham ud uden for Staden og stenede ham. Og Vidnerne
      lagde deres Klæder af ved en ung Mands Fødder, som hed Saulus.
 59.  Og de stenede Stefanus, som bad og sagde: "Herre Jesus, tag imod
      min Ånd!"
 60.  Men han faldt på Knæ og råbte med høj Røst: "Herre, tilregn dem
      ikke denne Synd!" Og som han sagde dette, sov han hen.  (Kap.8)
      1 Men Saulus fandt Behag i hans Mord.

Apostelenes gerninger 8

  1.  Og på den Dag udbrød der en stor Forfølgelse imod Menigheden i
      Jerusalem, og de adspredtes alle over Judæas og Samarias Egne,
      undtagen Apostlene.
  2.  Men gudfrygtige Mænd begravede Stefanus og holdt en stor Veklage
      over ham.
  3.  Men Saulus plagede Menigheden og gik ind i Husene og trak både
      Mænd og Kvinder frem og lod dem sætte i Fængsel.
  4.  Imidlertid gik de, som bleve adspredte, omkring og forkyndte
      Evangeliets Ord.

  5.  Da kom Filip til Byen Samaria og prædikede Kristus for dem.
  6.  Og Skarerne gave endrægtigt Agt på det, som blev sagt af Filip,
      idet de hørte og så de Tegn, som han gjorde.
  7.  Thi der var mange, som havde urene Ånder, og af hvem disse fore
      ud, råbende med høj Røst; og mange værkbrudne og lamme bleve
      helbredte.
  8.  Og der blev en stor Glæde i denne By.
  9.  Men en Mand, ved Navn Simon, var i Forvejen i Byen og drev
      Trolddom og satte Samarias Folk i Forbavselse, idet han udgav
      sig selv for at være noget stort.
 10.  På ham gave alle Agt, små og store, og sagde: "Det er ham, som
      man kalder Guds store Kraft."
 11.  Men de gave Agt på ham, fordi han i lang Tid havde sat dem i
      Forbavselse ved sine Trolddomskunster.
 12.  Men da de troede Filip, som forkyndte Evangeliet om Guds Rige og
      Jesu Kristi Navn, lode de sig døbe, både Mænd og Kvinder.
 13.  Men Simon troede også selv, og efter at være døbt holdt han sig
      nær til Filip; og da han så Tegn og store, kraftige Gerninger
      ske, forbavsedes han højligt.
 14.  Men da Apostlene i Jerusalem hørte, at Samaria havde taget imod
      Guds Ord, sendte de Peter og Johannes til dem,
 15.  og da disse vare komne derned, bade de for dem om, at de måtte
      få den Helligånd;
 16.  thi den var endnu ikke falden på nogen af dem, men de vare blot
      døbte til den Herres Jesu Navn.
 17.  Da lagde de Hænderne på dem, og de fik den Helligånd.
 18.  Men da Simon så, at den Helligånd blev given ved Apostlenes
      Håndspålæggelse, bragte han dem Penge og sagde:
 19.  "Giver også mig denne Magt, at, hvem jeg lægger Hænderne på, han
      må få den Helligånd."
 20.  Men Peter sagde til ham: "Gid dit Sølv må gå til Grunde tillige
      med dig, fordi du mente at kunne erhverve Guds Gave for Penge.
 21.  Du har ikke Del eller Lod i dette Ord; thi dit Hjerte er ikke
      ret for Gud.
 22.  Omvend dig derfor fra denne din Ondskab og bed Herren, om dog
      dit Hjertes Påfund måtte forlades dig.
 23.  Thi jeg ser, at du er stedt i Bitterheds Galde og Uretfærdigheds
      Lænke."
 24.  Men Simon svarede og sagde: "Beder I for mig til Herren, for at
      intet af det, som I have sagt, skal komme over mig."
 25.  Men da de havde vidnet og talt Herrens Ord, vendte de tilbage
      til Jerusalem, og de forkyndte Evangeliet i mange af
      Samaritanernes Landsbyer.

 26.  Men en Herrens Engel talte til Filip og sagde: "Stå op og gå mod
      Syd på den Vej, som går ned fra Jerusalem til Gaza; den er øde."
 27.  Og han stod op og gik. Og se, der var en Æthioper, en Hofmand,
      en mægtig Mand hos Kandake, Æthiopernes Dronning, som var sat
      over alle hendes Skatte; han var kommen til Jerusalem for at
      tilbede.
 28.  Og han var på Hjemvejen og sad på sin Vogn og læste Profeten
      Esajas.
 29.  Men Ånden sagde til Filip:"Gå hen og hold dig til denne Vogn!"
 30.  Og Filip løb derhen og hørte ham læse Profeten Esajas; og han
      sagde: "Forstår du også det, som du læser?"
 31.  Men han sagde: "Hvorledes skulde jeg kunne det, uden nogen
      vejleder mig?" Og han bad Filip stige op og sætte sig hos ham.
 32.  Men det Stykke af Skriften, som han læste, var dette: "Som et
      Får blev han ført til Slagtning, og som et Lam er stumt imod
      den, der klipper det, således oplader han ej sin Mund.
 33.  I Fornedrelsen blev hans Dom taget bort; hvem kan fortælle om
      hans Slægt, efterdi hans Liv borttages fra Jorden?"
 34.  Men Hofmanden talte til Filip og sagde: "Jeg beder dig, om hvem
      siger Profeten dette? om sig selv eller om en anden?"
 35.  Da oplod Filip sin Mund, og idet han begyndte fra dette
      Skriftsted, forkyndte han ham Evangeliet om Jesus.
 36.  Men som de droge frem ad Vejen, kom de til noget Vand; og
      Hofmanden siger: "Se, her er Vand, hvad hindrer mig fra at blive
      døbt?"  (37 Men Filip sagde: "Dersom du tror, af hele dit
      Hjerte, kan det ske." Men han svarede og sagde: "Jeg tror, at
      Jesus Kristus er Guds Søn.")
 38.  Og han bød, at Vognen skulde holde, og de stege begge ned i
      Vandet, både Filip og Hofmanden; og han døbte ham
 39.  Men da de stege op af Vandet, bortrykkede Herrens Ånd Filip, og
      Hofmanden så ham ikke mere; thi han drog sin Vej med Glæde.
 40.  Men Filip blev funden i Asdod, og han drog omkring og forkyndte
      Evangeliet i alle Byerne, indtil han kom fil Kæsarea.

Apostelenes gerninger 9

  1.  Men Saulus, som endnu fnøs med Trusel og Mord imod Herrens
      Disciple, gik til Ypperstepræsten
  2.  og bad ham om Breve til Damaskus til Synagogerne, for at han, om
      han fandt nogle, Mænd eller Kvinder, som holdt sig til Vejen,
      kunde føre dem bundne til Jerusalem.
  3.  Men da han var undervejs og nærmede sig til Damaskus, omstrålede
      et Lys fra Himmelen ham pludseligt.
  4.  Og han faldt til Jorden og hørte en Røst, som sagde til ham:
      "Saul!  Saul! hvorfor forfølger du mig?"
  5.  Og han sagde: "Hvem er du, Herre?" Men han svarede: "Jeg er
      Jesus, som du forfølger.
  6.  Men stå op og gå ind i Byen, og det skal siges dig, hvad du bør
      gøre."
  7.  Men de Mænd, som rejste med ham, stode målløse, da de vel hørte
      Røsten, men ikke så nogen.
  8.  Og Saulus rejste sig op fra Jorden; men da han oplod sine Øjne,
      så han intet. Men de ledte ham ved Hånden og førte ham ind i
      Damaskus.
  9.  Og han kunde i tre Dage ikke se, og han hverken spiste eller
      drak.
 10.  Men der var en Discipel i Damaskus, ved Navn Ananias, og Herren
      sagde til ham i et Syn: "Ananias!" Og han sagde: "Se, her er
      jeg, Herre!"
 11.  Og Herren sagde til ham: "Stå op, gå hen i den Gade, som kaldes
      den lige, og spørg i Judas's Hus efter en ved Navn Saulus fra
      Tarsus; thi se, han beder.
 12.  Og han har i et Syn set en Mand, ved Navn Ananias, komme ind og
      lægge Hænderne på ham, for at han skulde blive seende."
 13.  Men Ananias svarede: "Herre! jeg har hørt af mange om denne
      Mand, hvor meget ondt han har gjort dine hellige i Jerusalem.
 14.  Og her har han Fuldmagt fra Ypperstepræsterne til at binde alle
      dem, som påkalde dit Navn."
 15.  Men Herren sagde til ham: "Gå; thi denne er mig et udvalgt
      Redskab til at bære mit Navn frem både for Hedninger og Konger
      og Israels Børn;
 16.  thi jeg vil, vise ham hvor meget han bør lide for mit Navns
      Skyld."
 17.  Men Ananias gik hen og kom ind i Huset og lagde Hænderne på ham
      og sagde: "Saul, Broder! Herren har sendt mig, den Jesus, der
      viste sig for dig på Vejen, ad hvilken du kom, for at du skal
      blive seende igen og fyldes med den Helligånd."
 18.  Og straks faldt der ligesom Skæl fra hans Øjne, og han blev
      seende, og han stod op og blev døbt.
 19.  Og han fik Mad og kom til Kræfter. Men han blev nogle Dage hos
      Disciplene i Damaskus.

 20.  Og straks prædikede han i Synagogerne om Jesus, at han er Guds
      Søn.
 21.  Men alle, som hørte det, forbavsedes og sagde: "Er det ikke ham,
      som i Jerusalem forfulgte dem, der påkaldte dette Navn, og var
      kommen hertil for at føre dem bundne til Ypperstepræsterne?"
 22.  Men Saulus voksede i Kraft og gendrev Jøderne, som boede i
      Damaskus, idet han beviste, at denne er Kristus.
 23.  Men da nogle Dage vare forløbne, holdt Jøderne Råd om at slå ham
      ihjel.
 24.  Men Saulus fik deres Efterstræbelser at vide. Og de bevogtede
      endog Portene både Dag og Nat, for at de kunde slå ham ihjel.
 25.  Men hans Disciple toge ham ved Nattetid og bragte ham ud igennem
      Muren, idet de firede ham ned i en Kurv.
 26.  Men da han kom til Jerusalem, forsøgte han at holde sig til
      Disciplene; men de frygtede alle for ham, da de ikke troede, at
      han var en Discipel.
 27.  Men Barnabas tog sig af ham og førte ham til Apostlene; og han
      fortalte dem, hvorledes han havde set Herren på Vejen, og at han
      havde talt til ham, og hvorledes han i Damaskus havde vidnet
      frimodigt i Jesu Navn.
 28.  Og han gik ind og gik ud med dem i Jerusalem
 29.  og vidnede frimodigt i Herrens Navn. Og han talte og tvistedes
      med Hellenisterne; men de toge sig for at slå ham ihjel.
 30.  Men da Brødrene fik dette at vide, førte de ham ned til Kæsarea
      og sendte ham videre til Tarsus.

 31.  Så havde da Menigheden Fred over hele Judæa og Galilæa og
      Samaria, og den opbyggedes og vandrede i Herrens Frygt, og ved
      den Helligånds Formaning voksede den.
 32.  Men det skete, medens Peter drog omkring alle Vegne, at han også
      kom ned til de hellige, som boede i Lydda.
 33.  Der fandt han en Mand ved Navn Æneas, som havde ligget otte År
      til Sengs og var værkbruden.
 34.  Og Peter sagde til ham: "Æneas! Jesus Kristus helbreder dig; stå
      op, og red selv din Seng!" Og han stod straks op.
 35.  Og alle Beboere af Lydda og Saron så ham, og de omvendte sig til
      Herren.
 36.  Men i Joppe var der en Discipelinde ved Navn Tabitha, hvilket
      udlagt betyder Hind; hun var rig på gode Gerninger og gav mange
      Almisser.
 37.  Men det skete i de Dage, at hun blev syg og døde. Da toede de
      hende og lagde hende i Salen ovenpå.
 38.  Men efterdi Lydda var nær ved Joppe, udsendte Disciplene, da de
      hørte, at Peter var der, to Mænd til ham og bade ham: "Kom uden
      Tøven over til os!"
 39.  Men Peter stod op og gik med dem. Og da han kom derhen, førte de
      ham op i Salen ovenpå, og alle Enkerne stode hos ham, græd og
      viste ham alle de Kjortler og Kapper, som "Hinden" havde
      forarbejdet, medens hun var hos dem.
 40.  Men Peter bød dem alle at gå ud, og han faldt på Knæ og bad; og
      han vendte sig til det døde Legeme og sagde: "Tabitha, stå op!"
      Men hun oplod sine Øjne, og da hun så Peter, satte hun sig op.
 41.  Men han gav hende Hånden og rejste hende op, og han kaldte på de
      hellige og Enkerne og fremstillede hende levende for dem.
 42.  Men det blev vitterligt over hele Joppe, og mange troede på
      Herren.
 43.  Og det skete, at han blev mange Dage i Joppe hos en vis Simon,
      en Garver.

Apostelenes gerninger 10

  1.  Men en Mand i Kæsarea ved Navn Konelius, en Høvedsmand ved den
      Afdeling, som kaldes den italienske,
  2.  en from Mand, der frygtede Gud tillige med hele sit Hus og gav
      Folket mange Almisser og altid bad til Gud,
  3.  han så klarlig i et Syn omtrent ved den niende Time på Dagen en
      Guds Engel, som kom ind til ham og sagde til ham: "Kornelius!"
  4.  Men han stirrede på ham og blev forfærdet og sagde: "Hvad er
      det, Herre?" Han sagde til ham: "Dine Bønner og dine Almisser
      ere opstegne til Ihukommelse for Gud.
  5.  Og send nu nogle Mænd til Joppe, og lad hente en vis Simon med
      Tilnavn Peter.
  6.  Han har Herberge hos en vis Simon, en Garver, hvis Hus er ved
      Havet."
  7.  Men da Engelen, som talte til ham, var gået bort, kaldte han to
      af sine Husfolk og en gudfrygtig Stridsmand af dem, som stadig
      vare om ham.
  8.  Og han fortalte dem det alt sammen og sendte dem til Joppe.
  9.  Men den næste Dag, da disse vare undervejs og nærmede sig til
      Byen, steg Peter op på Taget for at bede ved den sjette Time.
      10Og han blev meget hungrig og vilde have noget at spise; men
      medens de lavede det til, kom der en Henrykkelse over ham,
 11.  og han så Himmelen åbnet og noget, der dalede ned, ligesom en
      stor Dug, der ved de fire Hjørner sænkedes ned på Jorden;
 12.  og i denne var der alle Jordens firføddede Dyr og krybende Dyr
      og Himmelens Fugle.
 13.  Og en Røst lød til ham: "Stå op, Peter, slagt og spis!"
 14.  Men Peter sagde: "Ingenlunde, Herre! thi aldrig har jeg spist
      noget vanhelligt og urent."
 15.  Og atter for anden Gang lød der en Røst til ham: "Hvad Gud har
      renset, holde du ikke for vanhelligt!"
 16.  Og dette skete tre Gange, og straks blev dugen igen optagen til
      Himmelen.
 17.  Men medens Peter var tvivlrådig med sig selv om, hvad det Syn,
      som han havde set, måtte betyde, se, da havde de Mænd, som vare
      udsendte af Kornelius, opspurgt Simons Hus og stode for Porten.
 18.  Og de råbte og spurgte, om Simmon med Tilnavn Peter havde
      Herberge der.
 19.  Men idet Peter grublede over Synet, sagde Ånden til ham: "Se,
      der er tre Mænd, som søge efter dig;
 20.  men stå op, stig ned, og drag med dem uden at tvivle; thi det er
      mig, som har sendt dem."
 21.  Så steg Peter ned til Mændene og sagde: "Se, jeg er den, som I
      søge efter; hvad er Årsagen, hvorfor I ere komne?"
 22.  Men de sagde: "Høvedsmanden Kornelius, en retfærdig og
      gudfrygtig Mand, som har godt Vidnesbyrd af hele Jødernes Folk,
      har at en hellig Engel fået Befaling fra Gud til at lade dig
      hente til sit Hus og høre, hvad du har at sige."
 23.  Da kaldte han dem ind og gav dem Herberge. Men den næste Dag
      stod han op og drog bort med dem, og nogle af Brødrene fra Joppe
      droge med ham.
 24.  Og den følgende Dag kom de til Kæsarea. Men Kornelius ventede på
      dem og havde sammnenkaldt sine Frænder og nærmeste Venner.
 25.  Men da det nu skete, at Peter kom ind, gik Kornelius ham i Møde
      og faldt ned for hans Fødder og tilbad ham.
 26.  Men Peter rejste ham op og sagde: "Stå op! også jeg er selv et
      Menneske."
 27.  Og under Samtale med ham gik han ind og fandt mange samlede.
 28.  Og han sagde til dem: "I vide, hvor utilbørligt det er for en
      jødisk Mand at omgås med eller komne til nogen, som er af et
      fremmede Folk; men mig har Gud vist, at jeg ikke skulde kalde
      noget Menneske vanhelligt eller urent.
 29.  Derfor kom jeg også uden Indvending, da jeg blev hentet; og jeg
      spørger eder da, af hvad Årsag I hentede mig?"
 30.  Og Kornelius sagde: "For fire Dage siden fastede jeg indtil
      denne Time, og ved den niende Time bad jeg i mit Hus; og se, en
      Mand stod for mig i et strålende Klædebon,
 31.  og han sagde: Kornelius! din Bøn er hørt, og dine Almisser ere
      ihukommede for Gud.
 32.  Send derfor Bud til Joppe og lad Simon med Tilnavn Peter kalde,
      til dig; han har Herberge i Garveren Simons Hus ved Havet; han
      skal tale til dig, når han kommer.
 33.  Derfor sendte jeg straks Bud til dig, og du gjorde vel i at
      komme.  Nu ere vi derfor alle til Stede for Guds Åsyn for at
      høre alt, hvad der er dig befalet af Herren."
 34.  Men Peter oplod Munden og sagde: "Jeg forstår i Sandhed, at Gud
      ikke anser Personer;
 35.  men i hvert Folk er den, som frygter ham og gør Retfærdighed,
      velkommen for ham;
 36.  det Ord, som han sendte til Israels Børn, da han forkyndte Fred
      ved Jesus Kristus: han er alles Herre.
 37.  I kende det, som er udgået over hele Judæa, idet det begyndte
      fra Galilæa, efter den Dåb, som Johannes prædikede,
 38.  det om Jesus fra Nazareth, hvorledes Gud salvede ham med den
      Helligånd og Kraft, han, som drog omkring og gjorde vel og
      helbredte alle, som vare overvældede af Djævelen; thi Gud var
      med ham;
 39.  og vi ere Vidner om alt det, som han har gjort både i Jødernes
      Land og i Jerusalem, han, som de også sloge ihjel, idet de
      hængte ham på et Træ.
 40.  Ham oprejste Gud på den tredje dag og gav ham at åbenbares,
 41.  ikke for hele Folket, men for de Vidner, som vare forud udvalgte
      af Gud, for os, som spiste og drak med ham, efter at han var
      opstanden fra de døde.
 42.  Og han har påbudt os at prædike for Folket og at vidne, at han
      er den af Gud bestemte Dommer over levende og døde.
 43.  Ham give alle Profeterne det Vidnesbyrd, at enhver, som tror på
      ham, skal få Syndernes Forladelse ved hans Navn."
 44.  Medens Peter endnu talte disse Ord, faldt den Helligånd på alle
      dem, som hørte Ordet.
 45.  Og de troende af Omskærelsen, så mange, som vare komne med
      Peter, bleve meget forbavsede over, af den Helligånds Gave var
      bleven udgydt også over Hedningerne;
 46.  thi de hørte dem tale i Tunger og ophøje Gud.
 47.  Da svarede Peter: "Mon nogen kan formene disse Vandet; så de
      ikke skulde døbes, de, som dog havde fået den Helligånd lige så
      vel som vi?"
 48.  Og han befalede, af de skulde døbes i Jesu Kristi Navn. Da bade
      de ham om at blive der nogle Dage.

Apostelenes gerninger 11

  1.  Men Apostlene og de Brødre, som vare rundt om i Judæa, hørte, at
      også Hedningerne havde modtaget Guds Ord.
  2.  Og da Peter kom op til Jerusalem, tvistedes de af Omskærelsen
      med ham og sagde:
  3.  "Du er gået ind til uomskårne Mænd og har spist med dem."
  4.  Men Peter begyndte og forklarede dem det i Sammenhæng og sagde:
  5.  "Jeg var i Byen Joppe og bad; og jeg så i en Henrykkelse et Syn,
      noget, der dalede ned, ligesom en stor Dug, der ved de fire
      Hjørner sænkedes ned fra Himmelen, og den kom lige hen til mig.
  6.  Jeg stirrede på den og betragtede den og så da Jordens
      firføddede Dyr og vilde Dyr og krybende Dyr og Himmelens Fugle.
  7.  Og jeg hørte også en Røst, som sagde til mig: Stå op, Peter,
      slagt og spis!
  8.  Men jeg sagde: Ingenlunde, Herre! thi aldrig kom noget
      vanhelligt eller urent i min Mund.
  9.  Men en Røst svarede anden Gang fra Himmelen: Hvad Gud har
      renset, holde du ikke for vanhelligt!
 10.  Og dette skete tre Gange; så blev det igen alt sammen draget op
      til Himmelen.
 11.  Og se, i det samme stode tre Mænd ved det Hus, i hvilket jeg
      var, som vare udsendte til mig fra Kæsarea.
 12.  Men Ånden sagde til mig, at jeg skulde gå med dem uden at gøre
      Forskel. Men også disse seks Brødre droge med mig, og vi gik ind
      i Mandens Hus.
 13.  Og han fortalte os, hvorledes han havde set Engelen stå i hans
      Hus og sige: Send Bud til Joppe og lad Simon med Tilnavn Peter
      hente!
 14.  Han skal tale Ord til dig, ved hvilke du og hele dit Hus skal
      frelses.
 15.  Men idet jeg begyndte at tale, faldt den Helligånd på dem
      ligesom også på os i Begyndelsen.
 16.  Og jeg kom Herrens Ord i Hu, hvorledes han sagde: Johannes døbte
      med Vand, men I skulle døbes med den Helligånd.
 17.  Når altså Gud gav dem lige Gave med os, da de troede på den
      Herre Jesus Kristus,hvem var da jeg, at jeg skulde kunne hindre
      Gud?"
 18.  Men da de hørte dette, bleve de rolige, og de priste Gud og
      sagde: "Så har Gud også givet Hedningerne Omvendelsen til Liv."

 19.  De, som nu vare blevne adspredte på Grund af den Trængsel, som
      opstod i Anledning af Stefanus, vandrede om lige til Fønikien og
      Kypern og Antiokia, og de talte ikke Ordet til nogen uden til
      Jøder alene.
 20.  Men iblandt dem var der nogle Mænd fra Kypern og Kyrene, som kom
      til Antiokia og talte også til Grækerne og forkyndte Evangeliet
      om den Herre Jesus.
 21.  Og Herrens Hånd var med dem, og et stort Antal blev troende og
      omvendte sig til Herren.
 22.  Men Rygtet om dem kom Menigheden i Jerusalem for Øre, og de
      sendte Barnabas ud til Antiokia.
 23.  Da han nu kom derhen og så Guds Nåde, glædede han sig og
      formanede alle til med Hjertets Forsæt at blive ved Herren.
 24.  Thi han var en god Mand og fuld af den Helligånd og Tro. Og en,
      stor Skare blev ført til Herren.
 25.  Men han drog ud til Tarsus for at opsøge Saulus; og da han fandt
      ham, førte han ham til Antiokia.
 26.  Og det skete, at de endog et helt År igennem færdedes sammen i
      Menigheden og lærte en stor Skare, og at Disciplene først i
      Antiokia bleve kaldte Kristne.

 27.  Men i disse Dage kom der Profeter ned fra Jerusalem til Antiokia
 28.  Og en af dem, ved Navn Agabus, stod op og tilkendegav ved Ånden,
      at der skulde komme en stor Hungersnød over hele Verden, hvilken
      også kom under Klaudius.
 29.  Men Disciplene besluttede at sende, hver efter sin Evne, noget
      til Hjælp for Brødrene, som boede i Judæa;
 30.  hvilket de også gjorde, og de sendte det til de Ældste ved
      Barnabas og Saulus's Hånd.

Apostelenes gerninger 12

  1.  På den Tid lagde Kong Herodes den for at mishandle dem,
  2.  og Jakob, Johannes's Broder, lod han henrette med Sværd.
  3.  Og da han så, at det behagede Jøderne, gik han videre og lod
      også Peter gribe. Det var de usyrede Brøds Dage.
  4.  Og da han havde grebet ham, satte han ham i Fængsel og overgav
      ham til at bevogtes af fire Vagtskifter, hvert på fire
      Stridsmænd, da han efter Påsken vilde føre ham frem for Folket.
  5.  Så blev da Peter bevogtet i Fængselet; men der blev af
      Menigheden holdt inderlig Bøn til Gud for ham.
  6.  Men da Herodes vilde til at føre ham frem, sov Peter den Nat
      imellem to Stridsmænd, bunden med to Lænker, og Vagter foran
      Døren bevogtede Fængselet.
  7.  Og se, en Herrens Engel stod der, og et Lys strålede i
      Fangerummet, og han slog Peter i Siden og vækkede ham og sagde:
      "Stå op i Hast!" og Lænkerne faldt ham af Hænderne.
  8.  Og Engelen sagde til ham: "Bind op om dig, og bind dine Sandaler
      på!" Og han gjorde så. Og han siger til ham: "Kast din Kappe om
      dig, og følg mig!"
  9.  Og han gik ud og fulgte ham, og han vidste ikke, at det, som
      skete ved Engelen, var virkeligt, men mente, at han så et Syn.
 10.  Men de gik igennem den første og den anden Vagt og kom til den
      Jernport, som førte ud til Staden; denne åbnede sig for dem af
      sig selv, og de kom ud og gik en Gade frem, og straks skiltes
      Engelen fra ham.
 11.  Og da Peter kom til sig selv, sagde han: "Nu ved jeg i Sandhed,
      at Herren udsendte sin Engel og udfriede mig af Herodes's Hånd
      og al det jødiske Folks Forventning."
 12.  Og da han havde besindet sig, gik han til Marias Hus, hun, som
      var Moder til Johannes, med Tilnavn Markus, hvor mange vare
      forsamlede og bade.
 13.  Men da han bankede på Døren til Portrummet, kom der en Pige ved
      Navn Rode for at høre efter.
 14.  Og da hun kendte Peters Røst, lod hun af Glæde være at åbne
      Porten, men løb ind og forkyndte dem, at Peter stod uden for
      Porten.
 15.  Da sagde de til hende: "Du raser." Men hun stod fast på, at det
      var således. Men de sagde: "Det er hans Engel."
 16.  Men Peter blev ved at banke på, og da de lukkede op, så de ham
      og bleve forbavsede.
 17.  Da vinkede han til dem med Hånden, at de skulde tie, og fortalte
      dem, hvorledes Herren havde ført ham ud af Fængselet, og han
      sagde: "Forkynder Jakob og Brødrene dette!" Og han gik ud og
      drog til et andet Sted.

 18.  Men da det blev Dag, var der ikke liden Uro iblandt
      Stridsmændene over, hvad der var blevet af Peter.
 19.  Men da Herodes søgte ham og ikke fandt ham, forhørte han Vagten
      og befalede, at de skulde henrettes. Og han drog ned fra Judæa
      til Kæsarea og opholdt sig der.
 20.  Men han lå i Strid med Tyrierne og Sidonierne. Men de kom
      endrægtigt til ham og fik Blastus, Kongens Kammerherre, på deres
      Side og bade om Fred, fordi deres Land fik Næringsmidler
      tilførte fra Kongens Land.
 21.  Men på en fastsat Dag iførte Herodes sig en Kongedragt og satte
      sig på Tronen og holdt en Tale til dem,
 22.  Og Folket råbte til ham: "DeterGudsRøstog ikke et Menneskes."
 23.  Men straks slog en Herrens Engel ham, fordi han ikke gav Gud
      Æren; og han blev fortæret af Orme og udåndede.
 24.  Men Guds Ord havde Fremgang og udbredtes.
 25.  Og Barnabas og Saulus vendte tilbage fra Jerusalem efter at have
      fuldført deres Ærinde, og de havde Johannes, med Tilnavn Markus,
      med sig.

Apostelenes gerninger 13

  1.  Men i Antiokia, i den derværende Menighed, var der Profeter og
      Lærere, nemlig Barnabas og Simeon, med Tilnavn Niger, og
      Kyrenæeren Lukius og Manaen, en Fosterbroder af Fjerdingsfyrsten
      Herodes, og Saulus.
  2.  Medens de nu holdt Gudstjeneste og fastede, sagde den Helligånd:
      "Udtager mig Barnabas og Saulus til den Gerning, hvortil jeg har
      kaldet dem."
  3.  Da fastede de og bade og lagde Hænderne på dem og lode dem fare.
  4.  Da de nu således vare udsendte af den Helligånd, droge de ned
      til Seleukia og sejlede derfra til Kypern.
  5.  Og da de vare komne til Salamis, forkyndte de Guds Ord i
      Jødernes Synagoger; men de havde også Johannes til Medhjælper.
  6.  Og da de vare dragne igennem hele Øen indtil Pafus, fandt de en
      Troldkarl, en falsk Profet, en Jøde, hvis Navn var Barjesus.
  7.  Han var hos Statholderen Sergius Paulus, en forstandig
      Mand. Denne kaldte Barnabas og Saulus til sig og attråede at
      høre Guds Ord.
  8.  Men Elimas, Troldkarlen, (thi dette betyder hans Navn), stod dem
      imod og søgte at vende Statholderen bort fra Troen.
  9.  Men Saulus, som også kaldes Paulus, blev fyldt med den
      Helligånd, så fast på ham og sagde:
 10.  "O, du Djævelens Barn, fuld af al Svig og al Underfundighed, du
      Fjende af al Retfærdighed! vil du ikke holde op med at forvende
      Herrens de lige Veje?
 11.  Og nu se, Herrens Hånd er over dig, og du skal blive blind og
      til en Tid ikke se Solen." Men straks faldt der Mulm og Mørke
      over ham, og han gik omkring og søgte efter nogen, som kunde
      lede ham.
 12.  Da Statholderen så det, som var sket, troede han, slagen af
      Forundring over Herrens Lære.

 13.  Paulus og de, som vare med ham, sejlede da ud fra Pafus og kom
      til Perge i Pamfylien. Men Johannes skiltes fra dem og vendte
      tilbage til Jerusalem.
 14.  Men de droge videre fra Perge og kom til Antiokia i Pisidien og
      gik ind i Synagogen på Sabbatsdagen og satte sig.
 15.  Men efter Forelæsningen af Loven og Profeterne sendte
      Synagogeforstanderne Bud hen til dem og lode sige: "I Mænd,
      Brødre!  have I noget Formaningsord til Folket, da siger frem!"
 16.  Men Paulus stod op og slog til Lyd med Hånden og sagde: "I
      israelitiske Mænd og I, som frygte Gud, hører til!  17. Dette
      Folks, Israels Gud udvalgte vore Fædre og ophøjede Folket i
      Udlændigheden i Ægyptens Land og førte dem derfra med løftet
      Arm.
 18.  Og omtrent fyrretyve År tålte han deres Færd i Ørkenen.
 19.  Og han udryddede syv Folk i Kanåns Land og fordelte disses Land
      iblandt dem,
 20.  og derefter i omtrent fire Hundrede og halvtredsindstyve År gav
      han dem Dommere indtil Profeten Samuel.
 21.  Og derefter bade de om en Konge; og Gud gav dem Saul, Kis's Søn,
      en Mand af Benjamins Stamme, i fyrretyve År.
 22.  Og da han havde taget ham bort, oprejste han dem David til
      Konge, om hvem han også vidnede, og sagde: "Jeg har fundet
      David, Isajs Søn, en Mand efter mit Hjerte, som skal gøre al min
      Villie."
 23.  Af dennes Sæd bragte Gud efter Forjættelsen Israel en Frelser,
      Jesus,
 24.  efter at Johannes forud for hans Fremtræden havde prædiket
      Omvendelses-Dåb for hele Israels Folk.
 25.  Men da Johannes var ved at fuldende sit Løb, sagde han: "Hvad
      anse I mig for at være? Mig er det ikke; men se, der kommer en
      efter mig, hvis Sko jeg ikke er værdig at løse."
 26.  I Mænd, Brødre, Sønner af Abrahams Slægt, og de iblandt eder,
      som frygte Gud! Til os er Ordet om denne Frelse sendt.
 27.  Thi de, som bo i Jerusalem, og deres Rådsherrer kendte ham ikke;
      de dømte ham og opfyldte derved Profeternes Ord, som forelæses
      hver Sabbat.
 28.  Og om end de ingen Dødsskyld fandt hos ham, bade de dog Pilatus,
      at han måtte blive slået ihjel.
 29.  Men da de havde fuldbragt alle Ting, som ere skrevne om ham,
      toge de ham ned af Træet og lagde ham i en Grav.
 30.  Men Gud oprejste ham fra de døde,
 31.  og han blev set i flere Dage af dem, som vare gåede med ham op
      fra Galilæa til Jerusalem, dem, som nu ere hans Vidner for
      Folket.
 32.  Og vi forkynde eder den Forjættelse, som blev given til Fædrene,
      at Gud har opfyldt denne for os, deres Børn, idet han oprejste
      Jesus;
 33.  som der også er skrevet i den anden Salme: "Du er min Søn, jeg
      har født dig i Dag."
 34.  Men at han har oprejst ham fra de døde, så at han ikke mere skal
      vende tilbage til Forrådnelse, derom har han sagt således: "Jeg
      vil give eder Davids hellige Forjættelser, de trofaste."
 35.  Thi han siger også i en anden Salme: "Du skal ikke tilstede din
      hellige at se Forrådnelse."
 36.  David sov jo hen, da han i sin Livstid havde tjent Guds
      Rådslutning, og han blev henlagt hos sine Fædre og så
      Forrådnelse;
 37.  men den, som Gud oprejste, så ikke Forrådnelse.
 38.  Så være det eder vitterligt, I Mænd, Brødre! at ved ham
      forkyndes der eder Syndernes Forladelse;
 39.  og fra alt, hvorfra I ikke kunde retfærdiggøres ved Mose Lov,
      retfærdiggøres ved ham enhver, som tror.
 40.  Ser nu til, at ikke det, som er sagt ved Profeterne, kommer over
      eder:
 41.  "Ser, I Foragtere, og forundrer eder og bliver til intet; thi en
      Gerning gør jeg i eders Dage, en Gerning, som I ikke vilde tro,
      dersom nogen fortalte eder den."
 42.  Men da de gik ud, bad man dem om, at disse Ord måtte blive talte
      til dem på den følgende Sabbat.
 43.  Men da Forsamlingen var opløst, fulgte mange af Jøderne og af de
      gudfrygtige Proselyter Paulus og Barnabas, som talte til dem og
      formanede dem til at blive fast ved Guds Nåde.

 44.  Men på den følgende Sabbat forsamledes næsten hele Byen for at
      høre Guds Ord.
 45.  Men da Jøderne så Skarerne, bleve de fulde af Nidkærhed og
      modsagde det, som blev talt af Paulus, ja, både sagde imod og
      spottede.
 46.  Men Paulus og Barnabas talte frit ud og sagde: "Det var
      nødvendigt, at Guds Ord først skulde tales til eder; men efterdi
      I støde det fra eder og ikke agte eder selv værdige til det
      evige Liv, se, så vende vi os til Hedningerne.
 47.  Thi således har Herren befalet os: "Jeg har sat dig til
      Hedningers Lys, for at du skal være til Frelse lige ud til
      Jordens Ende."
 48.  Men da Hedningerne hørte dette, bleve de glade og priste Herrens
      Ord, og de troede, så mange, som vare bestemte til evigt Liv,
 49.  og Herrens Ord udbredtes over hele Landet.
 50.  Men Jøderne ophidsede de fornemme gudfrygtige Kvinder og de
      første Mænd i Byen; og de vakte en Forfølgelse imod Paulus og
      Barnabas og joge dem ud fra deres Grænser.
 51.  Men de rystede Støvet af deres Fødder imod dem og droge til
      Ikonium.
 52.  Men Disciplene bleve fyldte med Glæde og den Helligånd.

Apostelenes gerninger 14

  1.  Men det skete i Ikonium, at de sammen gik ind i Jødernes
      Synagoge og talte således, at en stor Mængde,både af Jøder og
      Grækere, troede.
  2.  Men de Jøder, som vare genstridige, ophidsede Hedningernes Sind
      og satte ondt i dem imod Brødrene.
  3.  De opholdt sig nu en Tid lang der og talte med Frimodighed i
      Herren, som gav sin Nådes Ord Vidnesbyrd, idet han lod Tegn og
      Undere ske ved deres Hænder.
  4.  Men Mængden i Byen blev uenig, og nogle holdt med Jøderne, andre
      med Apostlene.

  5.  Men da der blev et Opløb, både af Hedningerne og Jøderne med
      samt deres Rådsherrer, for at mishandle og stene dem,
  6.  og de fik dette at vide, flygtede de bort til Byerne i
      Lykaonien, Lystra og Derbe, og til det omliggende Land,
  7.  og der forkyndte de Evangeliet.
  8.  Og i Lystra sad der en Mand, som var kraftesløs i Fødderne, lam
      fra Moders Liv, og han havde aldrig gået.
  9.  Han hørte Paulus tale; og da denne fæstede Øjet på ham og så, at
      han havde Tro til at frelses, sagde han med høj Røst:
 10.  "Stå ret op på dine Fødder!" Og han sprang op og gik omkring.
 11.  Men da Skarerne så, hvad Paulus havde gjort, opløftede de deres
      Røst og sagde på Lykaonisk: "Guderne ere i menneskelig Skikkelse
      stegne ned til os."
 12.  Og de kaldte Barnabas Zens, men Paulus Hermes, fordi han var
      den, som førte Ordet.
 13.  Men Præsten ved Zenstemplet, som var uden for Byen, bragte Tyre
      og Kranse hen til Portene og vilde ofre tillige med Skarerne.
 14.  Men da Apostlene, Barnabas og Paulus, hørte dette, sønderreve de
      deres Klæder og sprang ind i Skaren,
 15.  råbte og sagde: "I Mænd! hvorfor gøre I dette? Vi ere også
      Mennesker, lige Kår undergivne med eder, og vi forkynde eder
      Evangeliet om at vende om fra disse tomme Ting til den levende
      Gud, som har gjort Himmelen og Jorden og Havet og alt, hvad der
      er i dem;
 16.  han, som i de forbigangne Tider lod alle Hedningerne vandre
      deres egne Veje,
 17.  ihvorvel han ikke lod sig selv være uden Vidnesbyrd, idet han
      gjorde godt og gav eder Regn og frugtbare Tider fra Himmelen og
      mættede eders Hjerter med Føde og Glæde."
 18.  Og det var med Nød og næppe, at de ved at sige dette afholdt
      Skarerne fra at ofre til dem.
 19.  Men der kom Jøder til fra Antiokia og Ikonium, og de overtalte
      Skarerne og stenede Paulus og slæbte ham uden for Byen i den
      Tro, at han var død.
 20.  Men da Disciplene omringede ham, stod han op og gik ind i
      Byen. Og den næste Dag gik han med Barnabas bort til Derbe.

 21.  Og da de havde forkyndt Evangeliet i denne By og vundet mange
      Disciple, vendte de tilbage til Lystra og Ikonium og Antiokia
 22.  og styrkede Disciplenes Sjæle og påmindede dem om at blive i
      Troen og om, at vi må igennem mange Trængsler indgå i Guds Rige.
 23.  Men efter at de i hver Menighed havde udvalgt Ældste for dem,
      overgave de dem under Bøn og Faste til Herren, hvem de havde
      givet deres Tro.
 24.  Og de droge igennem Pisidien og kom til Pamfylien.
 25.  Og da de havde talt Ordet i Perge, droge de ned til Attalia.
 26.  Og derfra sejlede de til Antiokia, hvorfra de vare blevne
      overgivne til Guds Nåde til den Gerning, som de havde fuldbragt.
 27.  Men da de kom derhen og havde forsamlet Menigheden, forkyndte
      de, hvor store Ting Gud havde gjort med dem, og at han havde
      åbnet en Troens Dør for Hedningerne.
 28.  Men de opholdt sig en ikke liden Tid sammen med Disciplene.

Apostelenes gerninger 15

  1.  Og der kom nogle ned fra Judæa, som lærte Brødrene: "Dersom I
      ikke lade eder omskære efter Mose Skik, kunne I ikke blive
      frelste."
  2.  Da nu Paulus og Barnabas kom i en ikke ringe Splid og Strid med
      dem, så besluttede man, at Paulus og Barnabas og nogle andre af
      dem skulde drage op til Jerusalem til Apostlene og de Ældste i
      Anledning af dette Spørgsmål.
  3.  Disse bleve da sendte af Sted af Menigheden og droge igennem
      Fønikien og Samaria og fortalte om Hedningernes Omvendelse, og
      de gjorde alle Brødrene stor Glæde.
  4.  Men da de kom til Jerusalem, bleve de modtagne af Menigheden og
      Apostlene og de Ældste, og de kundgjorde, hvor store Ting Gud
      havde gjort med dem.
  5.  Men nogle af Farisæernes Parti, som vare blevne troende, stode
      op og sagde: "Man bør omskære dem og befale dem at holde Mose
      Lov."
  6.  Men Apostlene og de Ældste forsamlede sig for at overlægge denne
      Sag.
  7.  Men da man havde tvistet meget herom, stod Peter op og sagde til
      dem: "I Mænd, Brødre! I vide, at for lang Tid siden gjorde Gud
      det Valg iblandt eder, at Hedningerne ved min Mund skulde høre
      Evangeliets Ord og tro.
  8.  Og Gud, som kender Hjerterne, gav dem Vidnesbyrd ved at give dem
      den Helligånd lige så vel som os.
  9.  Og han gjorde ingen Forskel imellem os og dem, idet han ved
      Troen rensede deres Hjerter.
 10.  Hvorfor friste I da nu Gud, så I lægge et Åg på Disciplenes
      Nakke, som hverken vore Fædre eller vi have formået at bære?
 11.  Men vi tro, at vi bliver frelste ved den Herres Jesu Nåde på
      samme Måde som også de."
 12.  Men hele Mængden tav og de hørte Barnabas og Paulus fortælle,
      hvor store Tegn og Undere Gud havde gjort iblandt Hedningerne
      ved dem.
 13.  Men da de havde hørt op at tale, tog Jakob til Orde og sagde: "I
      Mænd, Brødre, hører mig!"
 14.  Simon har fortalt, hvorledes Gud først drog Omsorg for at tage
      ud af Hedninger et Folk for sit Navn.
 15.  Og dermed stemme Profeternes Tale overens, som der er skrevet:
 16.  "Derefter vil jeg vende tilbage og atter opbygge Davids faldne
      Hytte, og det nedrevne af den vil jeg atter opbygge og oprejse
      den igen,
 17.  for at de øvrige af Menneskene skulle søge Herren, og alle
      Hedningerne, over hvilke mit Navn er nævnet, siger Herren, som
      gør dette."
 18.  Gud kender fra Evighed af alle sine Gerninger.
 19.  Derfor mener jeg, at man ikke skal besvære dem af Hedningerne,
      som omvende sig til Gud,
 20.  men skrive til dem, at de skulle afholde sig fra Besmittelse med
      Afguderne og fra Utugt og fra det kvalte og fra Blodet.
 21.  Thi Moses har fra gammel Tid i hver By Mennesker, som prædike
      ham, idet han oplæses hver Sabbat i Synagogerne."
 22.  Da besluttede Apostelene og de Ældste tillige med hele
      Menigheden at udvælge nogle Mænd af deres Midte og sende dem til
      Antiokia tillige med Paulus og Barnabas, nemlig Judas, kaldet
      Barsabbas, og Silas, hvilke Mænd vare ansete iblandt Brødrene.
 23.  Og de skreve således med dem: "Apostlene og de Ældste og
      Brødrene hilse Brødrene af Hedningerne i Antiokia og Syrien og
      Kilikien.
 24.  Efterdi vi have hørt, at nogle, som ere komne fra os, have
      forvirret eder med Ord og voldt eders Sjæle Uro uden at have
      nogen Befaling fra os,
 25.  så have vi endrægtigt forsamlede, besluttet at udvælge nogle
      Mænd og sende dem til eder med vore elskelige Barnabas og
      Paulus,
 26.  Mænd, som have vovet deres Liv for vor Herres Jesu Kristi Navn.
 27.  Vi have derfor sendt Judas og Silas, der også mundtligt skulle
      forkynde det samme.
 28.  Thi det er den Helligånds Beslutning og vor, ingen videre Byrde
      at pålægge eder uden disse nødvendige Ting:
 29.  At I skulle afholde eder fra Afgudsofferkød og fra Blod og fra
      det kvalte og fra Utugt. Når I holde eder derfra, vil det gå
      eder godt.  Lever vel!"

 30.  Så lod man dem da fare, og de kom ned til Antiokia og forsamlede
      Mængden og overgave Brevet.
 31.  Men da de læste det, bleve de glade over Trøsten.
 32.  Og Judas og Silas, som også selv vare Profeter, opmuntrede
      Brødrene med megen Tale og styrkede dem.
 33.  Men da de havde opholdt sig der nogen Tid, lode Brødrene dem
      fare med Fred til dem, som havde udsendt dem.  (34 Men Silas
      besluttede at blive der.)
 35.  Men Paulus og Barnabas opholdt sig i Antiokia, hvor de tillige
      med mange andre lærte og forkyndte Herrens Ord.
 36.  Men efter nogen Tids Forløb sagde Paulus til Barnabas: "Lader os
      dog drage tilbage og besøge vore Brødre i hver By, hvor vi have
      forkyndt Herrens Ord, for at se, hvorledes det går dem."
 37.  Men Barnabas vilde også tage Johannes, kaldet Markus, med.
 38.  Men Paulus holdt for, at de ikke skulde tage den med, som havde
      forladt dem i Pamfylien og ikke havde fulgt med dem til
      Arbejdet.
 39.  Der blev da en heftig Strid, så at de skiltes fra hverandre, og
      Barnabas tog Markus med sig og sejlede til Kypern.
 40.  Men Paulus udvalgte Silas og drog ud, anbefalet af Brødrene til
      Herrens Nåde.
 41.  Men han rejste omkring i Syrien og Kilikien og styrkede
      Menighederne.

Apostelenes gerninger 16

  1.  Og han kom til Derbe og Lystra, og se, der var der en Discipel
      ved Navn Timotheus, Søn af en troende Jødinde og en græsk Fader.
  2.  Han havde godt Vidnesbyrd af Brødrene i Lystra og Ikonium.
  3.  Ham vilde Paulus have til at drage med sig, og han tog og omskar
      ham for Jødernes Skyld, som vare på disse Steder; thi de vidste
      alle, at hans Fader var en Græker.
  4.  Men alt som de droge igennem Byerne, overgave de dem de
      Bestemmelser at holde, som vare vedtagne af Apostlene og de
      Ældste i Jerusalem,
  5.  Så styrkedes Menighederne i Troen og voksede i Antal hver Dag.
  6.  Men de droge igennem Frygien og det galatiske Land, da de af den
      Helligånd vare blevne forhindrede i at tale Ordet i Asien.
  7.  Da de nu kom hen imod Mysien, forsøgte de at drage til
      Bithynien; og Jesu Ånd tilstedte dem det ikke.
  8.  De droge da Mysien forbi og kom ned til Troas.
  9.  Og et Syn viste sig om Natten for Paulus: En makedonisk Mand
      stod der og bad ham og sagde: "Kom over til Makedonien og hjælp
      os!"
 10.  Men da han havde set dette Syn, ønskede vi straks at drage over
      til Makedonien; thi vi sluttede, at Gud havde kaldt os derhen
      til at forkynde Evangeliet for dem.

 11.  Vi sejlede da ud fra Troas og styrede lige til Samothrake og den
      næste Dag til Neapolis
 12.  og derfra til Filippi, hvilken er den første By i den Del af
      Makedonien, en Koloni. I denne By opholdt vi os nogle Dage.
 13.  Og på Sabbatsdagen gik vi uden for Porten ved en Flod, hvor vi
      mente, at der var et Bedested", og vi satte os og talte til de
      Kvinder, som kom sammen.
 14.  Og en Kvinde ved Navn Lydia, en Purpurkræmmerske fra Byen
      Thyatira, en Kvinde, som frygtede Gud, hørte til, og hendes
      Hjerte oplod Herren til at give Agt på det, som blev talt af
      Paulus.
 15.  Men da hun og hendes Hus var blevet døbt, bad hun og sagde:
      "Dersom I agte mig for at være Herren tro, da kommer ind i mit
      Hus og bliver der!" Og hun nødte os.

 16.  Men det skete, da vi gik til Bedestedet, at en Pige mødte os,
      som havde en Spådomsånd og skaffede sine Herrer megen Vinding
      ved at spå.
 17.  Hun fulgte efter Paulus og os, råbte og sagde: "Disse Mennesker
      ere den højeste Guds Tjenere, som forkynde eder Frelsens Vej."
 18.  Og dette gjorde hun i mange Dage. Men Paulus blev fortrydelig
      derover, og han vendte sig og sagde til Ånden: "Jeg byder dig i
      Jesu Kristi Navn at fare ud af hende." Og den for ud i den samme
      Stund.
 19.  Men da hendes Herrer så, at deres Håb om Vinding var forsvundet,
      grebe de Paulus og Silas og slæbte dem hen på Torvet for
      Øvrigheden.
 20.  Og de førte dem til Høvedsmændene og sagde: "Disse Mennesker,
      som ere Jøder, forvirre aldeles vor By.
 21.  og de forkynde Skikke, som det ikke er tilladt os, der ere
      Romere, at antage eller øve."
 22.  Og Mængden rejste sig imod dem, og Høvedsmændene lode Klæderne
      rive af dem og befalede at piske dem.
 23.  Og da de havde givet dem mange Slag, kastede de dem i Fængsel og
      befalede Fangevogteren at holde dem sikkert bevogtede.
 24.  Da han havde fået sådan Befaling, kastede han dem i det inderste
      Fængsel og sluttede deres Fødder i Blokken.

 25.  Men ved Midnat bade Paulus og Silas og sang Lovsange til Gud; og
      Fangerne lyttede på dem.
 26.  Men pludseligt kom der et stort Jordskælv, så at Fængselets
      Grundvolde rystede, og straks åbnedes alle Dørene, og alles
      Lænker løstes.
 27.  Men Fangevogteren for op at Søvne, og da han så Fængselets Døre
      åbne, drog han et Sværd og vilde dræbe sig selv, da han mente,
      at Fangerne vare flygtede.
 28.  Men Paulus råbte med høj Røst og sagde: "Gør ikke dig selv noget
      ondt; thi vi ere her alle."
 29.  Men han forlangte Lys og sprang ind og faldt skælvende ned for
      Paulus og Silas.
 30.  Og han førte dem udenfor og sagde: "Herrer! hvad skal jeg gøre,
      for at jeg kan blive frelst?"
 31.  Men de sagde: "Tro på den Herre Jesus Kristus, så skal du blive
      frelst, du og dit Hus."
 32.  Og de talte Herrens Ord til ham og til alle dem, som vare i hans
      Hus.
 33.  Og han tog dem til sig i den samme Stund om Natten og aftoede
      deres Sår; og han selv og alle hans blev straks døbte.
 34.  Og han førte dem op i sit Hus og satte et Bord for dem og
      frydede sig over, at han med hele sit Hus var kommen til Troen
      på Gud.
 35.  Men da det var blevet Dag, sendte Høvedsmændene Bysvendene hen
      og sagde: "Løslad de Mænd!"
 36.  Men Fangevogteren meldte Paulus disse Ord: "Høvedsmændene have
      sendt Bud, at I skulle løslades; så drager nu ud og går bort med
      Fred!"
 37.  Men Paulus sagde til dem: "De have ladet os piske offentligt og
      uden Dom, os, som dog ere romerske Mænd, og kastet os i Fængsel,
      og nu jage de os hemmeligt bort! Nej, lad dem selv komme og føre
      os ud!"
 38.  Men Bysvendene meldte disse Ord til Høvedsmændene; og de bleve
      bange, da de hørte, at de vare Romere.
 39.  Og de kom og gave dem gode Ord, og de førte dem ud og bade dem
      at drage bort fra Byen.
 40.  Og de gik ud af Fængselet og gik ind til Lydia; og da de havde
      set Brødrene. formanede de dem og droge bort.

Apostelenes gerninger 17

  1.  Men de rejste igennem Amfipolis og Apollonia og kom til
      Thessalonika, hvor Jøderne havde en Synagoge.
  2.  Og efter sin Sædvane gik Paulus ind til dem, og på tre Sabbater
      samtalede han med dem ud fra Skrifterne,
  3.  idet han udlagde og forklarede, at Kristus måtte lide og opstå
      fra de døde, og han sagde: "Denne Jesus, som jeg forkynder eder,
      han er Kristus."
  4.  Og nogle af dem bleve overbeviste og sluttede sig til Paulus og
      Silas, og tillige en stor Mængde at de gudfrygtige Grækere og
      ikke få af de fornemste Kvinder.
  5.  Men Jøderne bleve nidkære og toge med sig nogle slette Mennesker
      af Lediggængerne på Torvet, rejste et Opløb og oprørte Byen; og
      de stormede Jasons Hus og søgte efter dem for at føre dem ud til
      Folket.
  6.  Men da de ikke fandt dem, trak de Jason og nogle Brødre for
      Byens Øvrighed og råbte: "Disse, som have bragt hele Verden i
      Oprør, ere også komne hid;
  7.  dem har Jason taget ind til sig; og alle disse handle imod
      Kejserens Befalinger og sige, at en anden er Konge, nemlig
      Jesus."
  8.  Og de satte Skræk i Mængden og Byens Øvrighed, som hørte det.
  9.  Og denne lod Jason og de andre stille Borgen og løslod dem.

 10.  Men Brødrene sendte straks om Natten både Paulus og Silas bort
      til Berøa; og da de vare komne dertil,gik de ind i Jødernes
      Synagoge.
 11.  Men disse vare mere velsindede end de i Thessalonika, de modtoge
      Ordet med al Redebonhed og ransagede daglig Skrifterne, om disse
      Ting forholdt sig således.
 12.  Så troede da mange af dem og ikke få af de fornemme græske
      Kvinder og Mænd.
 13.  Men da Jøderne i Thessalonika fik at vide, at Guds Ord blev
      forkyndt af Paulus også i Berøa, kom de og vakte også der Røre
      og Bevægelse iblandt Skarerne.

 14.  Men da sendte Brødrene straks Paulus bort, for at han skulde
      drage til Havet; men både Silas og Timotheus bleve der tilbage.
 15.  Og de, som ledsagede Paulus, førte ham lige til Athen; og efter
      at have fået det Bud med til Silas og Timotheus, at de snarest
      muligt skulde komme til ham, droge de bort.
 16.  Medens nu Paulus ventede på dem i Athen, harmedes hans Ånd i
      ham, da han så, at Byen var fuld af Afgudsbilleder.
 17.  Derfor talte han i Synagogen med Jøderne og de gudfrygtige og på
      Torvet hver Dag til dem, som han traf på.
 18.  Men også nogle af de epikuræiske og stoiske Filosoffer indlode
      sig i Ordstrid med ham; og nogle sagde: ""Hvad vil denne
      Ordgyder sige?"" men andre: ""Han synes at være en Forkynder af
      fremmede Guddomme;"" fordi han forkyndte Evangeliet om Jesus og
      Opstandelsen.
 19.  Og de toge ham og førte ham op på Areopagus og sagde: ""Kunne vi
      få at vide, hvad dette er for en ny Lære, som du taler om?
 20.  Thi du bringer os nogle fremmede Ting for Øren; derfor ville vi
      vide, hvad dette skal betyde.""
 21.  Men alle Atheniensere og de fremmede, som opholdt sig der, gave
      sig ikke Stunder til andet end at fortælle eller høre nyt.
 22.  Men Paulus stod frem midt på Areopagus og sagde: ""I
      athemiensiske Mænd! jeg ser, at I i alle Måder ere omhyggelige
      for eders Gudsdyrkelse.
 23.  Thi da jeg gik omkring og betragtede eders Helligdommen, fandt
      jeg også et Alter, på hvilket der var skrevet: ""For en ukendt
      Gud.""  Det, som I således dyrke uden at kende det, det
      forkynder jeg eder.
 24.  Gud, som har gjort Verden og alle Ting, som ere i den, han, som
      er Himmelens og Jordens Herre, bor ikke i Templer, gjorte med
      Hænder,
 25.  han tjenes ikke heller af Menneskers Hænder som en, der trænger
      til noget, efterdi han selv giver alle Liv og Ånde og alle Ting.
 26.  Og han har gjort, at hvert Folk iblandt Mennesker bor ud af eet
      Blod på hele Jordens Flade, idet han fastsatte bestemte Tider og
      Grænserne for deres Bolig,
 27.  for at de skulde søge Gud, om de dog kunde føle sig frem og
      finde ham, skønt han er ikke langt fra hver enkelt af os;
 28.  thi i ham leve og røres og ere vi, som også nogle af eders
      Digtere have sagt: Vi ere jo også hans Slægt.
 29.  Efterdi vi da ere Guds Slægt, bør vi ikke mene, at Guddommen er
      lig Guld eller Sølv eller Sten, formet ved Menneskers Kunst og
      Opfindsomhed.
 30.  Efter at Gud altså har båret over med disse Vankundighedens
      Tider, byder han nu Menneskene at de alle og alle Vegne skulle
      omvende sig.
 31.  Thi han har fastsat en Dag, på hvilken han vil dømme Jorderige
      med Retfærdighed ved en Mand, som han har beskikket dertil, og
      dette har han bevist for alle ved at oprejse ham fra de døde."
 32.  Men da de hørte om de dødes Opstandelse, spottede nogle; men
      andre sagde: "Ville atter høre dig om dette."
 33.  Således gik Paulus ud fra dem.
 34.  Men nogle Mænd holdt sig til ham og troede; iblandt hvilke også
      var Areopagiten Dionysius og en Kvinde ved Navn Damaris og andre
      med dem.

Apostelenes gerninger 18

  1.  Derefter forlod Paulus Athen og kom til Korinth
  2.  Der traf han en Jøde ved Navn Akvila, født i Pontus, som nylig
      var kommen fra Italien med sin Hustru Priskilla, fordi Klaudius
      havde befalet, at alle Jøderne skulde forlade Rom. Til disse gik
      han.
  3.  Og efterdi han øvede det samme Håndværk, blev han hos dem og
      arbejdede; thi de vare Teltmagere af Håndværk.
  4.  Men han holdt Samtaler i Synagogen på hver Sabbat og overbeviste
      Jøder og Grækere.
  5.  Men da Silas og Timotheus kom ned fra Makedonien, var Paulus
      helt optagen af at tale og vidnede for Jøderne, at Jesus er
      Kristus.
  6.  Men da de stode imod og spottede, rystede han Støvet af sine
      Klæder og sagde til dem: "Eders Blod komme over eders Hoved! Jeg
      er ren; herefter vil jeg gå til Hedningerne."
  7.  Og han gik bort derfra og gik ind til en Mand ved Navn Justus,
      som frygtede Gud, og hvis Hus lå ved Siden af Synagogen.
  8.  Men Synagogeforstanderen Krispus troede på Herren tillige med
      hele sit Hus, og mange af Korinthierne, som hørte til, troede og
      bleve døbte.
  9.  Men Herren sagde til Paulus i et Syn om Natten: "Frygt ikke, men
      tal og ti ikke,
 10.  eftersom jeg er med dig, og ingen skal lægge Hånd på dig for at
      gøre dig noget ondt; thi jeg har et talrigt Folk i denne By."
 11.  Og han slog sig ned der et År og seks Måneder og lærte Guds Ord
      iblandt dem.
 12.  Men medens Gallio var Statholder i Akaja, stode Jøderne
      endrægtigt op imod Paulus og førte ham for Domstolen og sagde:
 13.  "Denne overtaler Folk til en Gudsdyrkelse imod Loven."
 14.  Og da Paulus vilde oplade Munden, sagde Gallio til Jøderne: "
      Dersom det var nogen Uret eller Misgerning, I Jøder! vilde jeg,
      som billigt var, tålmodigt høre på eder.
 15.  Men er det Stridsspørgsmål om Lære og Navne og om den Lov, som I
      have, da ser selv dertil; thi jeg vil ikke være Dommer over
      disse Ting."
 16.  Og han drev dem bort fra Domstolen.
 17.  Men alle grebe Synagogeforstanderen Sosthenes og sloge ham lige
      for Domstolen; og Gallio brød sig ikke om noget af dette.

 18.  Men Paulus blev der endnu i mange dage; derefter tog han Afsked
      med Brødrene og sejlede bort til Syrien og med ham Priskilla og
      Akvila, efter at han havde ladet sit Hår klippe af i Kenkreæ;
      thi han havde et Løfte på sig.
 19.  Men de kom til Efesus; og der lod han hine blive tilbage; men
      han selv gik ind i Synagogen og samtalede med Jøderne.
 20.  Men da de bade ham om at blive i længere Tid, samtykkede han
      ikke;
 21.  men han tog Afsked og sagde: " (Jeg må endelig holde denne
      forestående Højtid i Jerusalem; men) jeg vil atter vende tilbage
      til eder, om Gud vil." Og han sejlede ud fra Efesus
 22.  og landede i Kæsarea, drog op og hilste på Menigheden og drog så
      ned til Antiokia.

 23.  Og da han havde opholdt sig der nogen Tid, drog han bort og
      rejste fra Sted til Sted igennem det galatiske Land og Frygien
      og styrkede alle Disciplene.

 24.  Men en Jøde ved Navn Apollos, født i Aleksandria, en veltalende
      Mand, som var stærk i Skrifterne, kom til Efesus.
 25.  Denne var undervist om Herrens Vej, og brændende i Ånden talte
      og lærte han grundigt om Jesus, skønt han kun kendte Johannes's
      Dåb.
 26.  Og han begyndte at tale frimodigt i Synagogen. Men da Priskilla
      og Akvila hørte ham,toge de ham til sig og udlagde ham Guds Vej
      nøjere.
 27.  Men da han vilde rejse videre til Akaja, skrev Brødrene til
      Disciplene og opmuntrede dem til at tage imod ham. Da han var
      kommen derhen, var han ved Guds Nåde de troende til megen Nytte;
 28.  thi han gendrev Jøderne offentligt med stor Kraft og beviste ved
      Skrifterne, at Jesus er Kristus.

Apostelenes gerninger 19

  1.  Men det skete, medens Apollos var i Korinth, at Paulus efter at
      være dragen igennem de højereliggende Landsdele kom ned til
      Efesus
  2.  og fandt nogle Disciple, og han sagde til dem: "Fik I den
      Helligånd, da I bleve troende?" Men de sagde til ham: "Vi have
      ikke engang hørt, at der er en Helligånd."
  3.  Og han sagde: "Hvortil bleve I da døbte?" Men de sagde: "Til
      Johannes's Dåb."
  4.  Da sagde Paulus: "Johannes døbte med Omvendelses-Dåb, idet han
      sagde til Folket, at de skulde tro på den, som kom efter ham,
      det er på Jesus."
  5.  Men da de hørte dette, lode de sig døbe til den Herres Jesu
      Navn.
  6.  Og da Paulus lagde Hænderne på dem, kom den Helligånd over dem,
      og de talte i Tunger og profeterede.
  7.  Men de vare i det hele omtrent tolv Mand.
  8.  Og han gik ind i Synagogen og vidnede frimodigt i tre Måneder,
      idet han holdt Samtaler og overbeviste om det, som hører til
      Guds Rige.
  9.  Men da nogle forhærdede sig og strede imod og over for Mængden
      talte ilde om Vejen, forlod han dem og skilte Disciplene fra dem
      og holdt daglig Samtaler i Tyrannus's Skole.
 10.  Men dette varede i to År, så at alle, som boede i Asien, både
      Jøder og Grækere, hørte Herrens Ord.
 11.  Og Gud gjorde usædvanlige kraftige Gerninger ved Paulus's
      Hænder,
 12.  så at man endog bragte Tørklæder og Bælter fra hans Legeme til
      de syge, og Sygdommene vege fra dem, og de onde Ånder fore ud.
 13.  Men også nogle af de omløbende jødiske Besværgere forsøgte at
      nævne den Herres Jesu Navn over dem, som havde de onde Ånder,
      idet de sagde: "Jeg besværger eder ved den Jesus, som Paulus
      prædiker."
 14.  Men de, som gjorde dette, vare syv Sønner af Skeuas, en jødisk
      Ypperstepræst,
 15.  Men den onde Ånd svarede og sagde til dem: "Jesus kender jeg, og
      om Paulus ved jeg; men I, hvem ere I?"
 16.  Og det Menneske, i hvem den onde Ånd var, sprang ind på dem og
      overmandede dem begge og fik sådan Magt over dem, at de flygtede
      nøgne og sårede ud af Huset.
 17.  Men dette blev vitterligt for alle dem, som boede i Efesus, både
      Jøder og Grækere; og der faldt en Frygt over dem alle, og den
      Herres Jesu Navn blev ophøjet,
 18.  og mange af dem, som vare blevne troende, kom og bekendte og
      fortalte om deres Gerninger.
 19.  Men mange af dem, som havde drevet Trolddom, bare deres Bøger
      sammen og opbrændte dem for alles Øjne; og man beregnede deres
      Værdi og fandt dem halvtredsindstyve Tusinde Sølvpenge værd.
 20.  Så kraftigt voksede Herrens Ord og fik Magt.

 21.  Men da dette var fuldbragt, satte Paulus sig for i Ånden, at han
      vilde rejse igennem Makedonien og Akaja og så drage til
      Jerusalem, og han sagde: "Efter at jeg har været der, bør jeg
      også se Rom."
 22.  Og han sendte to af dem, som gik ham til Hånde, Timotheus og
      Erastus, til Makedonien; men selv blev han nogen Tid i Asien.

 23.  Men på den Tid opstod der et ikke lidet Oprør i Anledning af
      Vejen.
 24.  Thi en Sølvsmed ved Navn Demetrius gjorde Artemistempler af Sølv
      og skaffede Kunstnerne ikke ringe Fortjeneste.
 25.  Disse samlede han tillige med de med sådanne Ting sysselsatte
      Arbejdere og sagde: "I Mænd! I vide, at vi have vort Udkomme af
      dette Arbejde.
 26.  Og I se og høre, at ikke alene i Efesus, men næsten i hele Asien
      har denne Paulus ved sin Overtalelse vildledt en stor Mængde,
      idet han siger, at de ikke ere Guder, de, som gøres med Hænder.
 27.  Men der er ikke alene Fare for, at denne vor Håndtering skal
      komme i Foragt, men også for, at den store Gudinde Artemis's
      Helligdom skal blive agtet for intet, og at den Gudindes
      Majestæt, hvem hele Asien og Jorderige dyrker, skal blive
      krænket."
 28.  Men da de hørte dette, bleve de fulde af Vrede og råbte og
      sagde: "Stor er Efesiernes Artemis!"
 29.  Og Byen kom i fuldt Oprør, og de stormede endrægtigt til Teatret
      og reve Makedonierne Hajus og Aristarkus, Paulus's Rejsefæller,
      med sig.
 30.  Men da Paulus vilde gå ind iblandt Folkemængden, tilstedte
      Disciplene ham det ikke.
 31.  Men også nogle af Asiarkerne, som vare hans Venner, sendte Bud
      til ham og formanede ham til ikke at vove sig hen til Teatret.
 32.  Da skrege nogle eet, andre et andet; thi Forsamlingen var i
      Forvirring, og de fleste vidste ikke, af hvad Årsag de vare
      komne sammen.
 33.  Men de trak Aleksander, hvem Jøderne skøde frem, ud af Skaren;
      men Aleksander slog til Lyd med Hånden og vilde holde en
      Forsvarstale til Folket.
 34.  Men da de fik at vide, at han var en Jøde, råbte de alle med een
      Røst i omtrent to Timer: "Stor er Efesiernes Artemis!"
 35.  Men Byskriveren fik Skaren beroliget og sagde: "I Mænd i Efesus!
      hvilket Menneske er der vel, som ikke ved, at Efesiernes By er
      Tempelværge for den store Artemis og det himmelfaldne Billede?
 36.  Når altså dette er uimodsigeligt, bør I være rolige og ikke
      foretage eder noget fremfusende.
 37.  Thi I have ført disse Mænd hid, som hverken er Tempelranere
      eller bespotte eders Gudinde.
 38.  Dersom nu Demetrius og hans Kunstnere have Klage imod nogen, da
      holdes der Tingdage, og der er Statholdere; lad dem kalde
      hinanden for Retten!
 39.  Men have I noget Forlangende om andre Sager, så vil det blive
      afgjort i den lovlige Forsamling.
 40.  Vi stå jo endog i Fare for at anklages for Oprør for, hvad der i
      Dag er sket, da der ingen Årsag er dertil; herfor, for dette
      Opløb, ville vi ikke kunne gøre regnskab."
 41.  Og da han havde sagt dette, lod han Forsamlingen fare.

Apostelenes gerninger 20

  1.  Men efter at dette Røre var stillet, lod Paulus Disciplene hente
      og formanede dem, tog Afsked og begav sig derfra for at rejse
      til Makedonien.
  2.  Og da han var dragen igennem disse Egne og havde formanet dem
      med megen Tale, kom han til Grækenland.
  3.  Der tilbragte han tre Måneder, og da Jøderne havde Anslag for
      imod ham, just som han skulde til at sejle til Syrien, blev han
      til Sinds at vende tilbage igennem Makedonien.
  4.  Men Pyrrus's Søn Sopater fra Berøa og af Thessalonikerne
      Aristarkus og Sekundus og Kajus fra Derbe og Timotheus og af
      Asiaterne Tykikus og Trofimus fulgte med ham til Asien.
  5.  Disse droge forud og biede på os i Troas;
  6.  men vi sejlede efter de usyrede Brøds Dage ud fra Filippi og kom
      fem Dage efter til dem i Troas, hvor vi tilbragte syv Dage.
  7.  Men på den første Dag i Ugen, da vi vare forsamlede for at bryde
      Brødet, samtalede Paulus med dem, da han den næste Dag vilde
      rejse derfra, og han blev ved med at tale indtil Midnat.
  8.  Men der var mange Lamper i Salen ovenpå, hvor vi vare samlede.
  9.  Og der sad i Vinduet en ung Mand ved Navn Eutykus; han faldt i
      en dyb Søvn, da Paulus fortsatte Samtalen så længe, og
      overvældet af Søvnen styrtede han ned fra det tredje Stokværk og
      blev tagen død op.
 10.  Men Paulus gik ned og kastede sig over ham og omfavnede ham og
      sagde: "Larmer ikke; thi hans Sjæl er i ham."
 11.  Men han gik op igen og brød Brødet og nød deraf og talte endnu
      længe med dem indtil Dagningen, og dermed drog han bort.
 12.  Men de bragte det unge Menneske levende op og vare ikke lidet
      trøstede.

 13.  Men vi gik forud til Skibet og sejlede til Assus og skulde
      derfra tage Paulus med; thi således havde han bestemt det, da
      han selv vilde gå til Fods.
 14.  Da han nu stødte til os i Assus, toge vi ham om Bord og kom til
      Mitylene.
 15.  Og vi sejlede derfra og kom den næste Dag lige udfor Kios; Dagen
      derpå lagde vi til ved Samos og kom næste Dag til Milet.
 16.  Thi Paulus havde besluttet at sejle Efesus forbi, for at det
      ikke skulde hændes, at han blev opholdt i Asien; thi han hastede
      for at komme til Jerusalem på Pinsedagen, om det var ham muligt.
 17.  Men fra Milet sendte han Bud til Efesus og lod Menighedens
      Ældste kalde til sig.
 18.  Og da de kom til ham, sagde han til dem: "I vide, hvorledes jeg
      færdedes iblandt eder den hele Tid igennem fra den første Dag,
      jeg kom til Asien,
 19.  idet jeg tjente Herren i al Ydmyghed og under Tårer og
      Prøvelser, som timedes mig ved Jødernes Efterstræbelser;
 20.  hvorledes jeg ikke har unddraget mig fra at forkynde eder noget
      som helst af det, som kunde være til Gavn, og at lære eder
      offentligt og i Husene,
 21.  idet jeg vidnede både for Jøder og Grækere om Omvendelsen til
      Gud og Troen på vor Herre Jesus Kristus.
 22.  Og nu se, bunden af Ånden drager jeg til Jerusalem uden at vide,
      hvad der skal møde mig,
 23.  kun, at den Helligånd i hver By vidner for mig og siger, at
      Lænker og Trængsler vente mig.
 24.  Men jeg agter ikke mit Liv noget værd for mig selv, for at jeg
      kan fuldende mit Løb og den Tjeneste, som jeg har fået af den
      Herre Jesus, at vidne om Guds Nådes Evangelium.
 25.  Og nu se, jeg ved, at I ikke mere skulle se mit Ansigt, alle I,
      iblandt hvem jeg gik om og prædikede Riget.
 26.  Derfor vidner jeg for eder på denne Dag, at jeg er ren for alles
      Blod;
 27.  thi jeg unddrog mig ikke fra at forkynde eder hele Guds Råd.
 28.  Så giver Agt på eder selv og den hele Hjord, i hvilken den
      Helligånd satte eder som Tilsynsmænd, til at vogte Guds
      Menighed, som han erhvervede sig med sit eget Blod.
 29.  Jeg ved, at der efter min Bortgang skal komme svare Ulve ind
      iblandt eder, som ikke ville spare Hjorden.
 30.  Og af eders egen Midte skal der opstå Mænd, som skulle tale
      forvendte Ting for at drage Disciplene efter sig.
 31.  Derfor våger og kommer i Hu, at jeg har ikke ophørt i tre År,
      Nat og Dag, at påminde hver enkelt med Tårer.
 32.  Og nu overgiver jeg eder til Gud og hans Nådes Ord, som formår
      at opbygge eder og at give eder Arven iblandt alle de helligede.
 33.  Jeg har ikke begæret nogens Sølv eller Guld eller Klædebon.
 34.  I vide selv, at disse Hænder have tjent for mine Fornødenheder
      og for dem, som vare med mig.
 35.  Jeg viste eder i alle Ting, at således bør vi arbejde og tage os
      af de skrøbelige og ihukomme den Herres Jesu Ord, at han selv
      har sagt: "Det er saligere at give end at tage."
 36.  Og da han havde sagt dette, faldt han på sine Knæ og bad med dem
      alle.
 37.  Og de brast alle i heftig Gråd, og de faldt Paulus om Halsen og
      kyssede ham.
 38.  Og mest smertede dem det Ord, han havde sagt, at de ikke mere
      skulde se hans Ansigt. Så ledsagede de ham til Skibet.

Apostelenes gerninger 21

  1.  Men da vi havde revet os løs fra dem og vare afsejlede, droge vi
      lige til Kos, og den næste Dag til Rodus og derfra til Patara.
  2.  Og da vi fandt et Skib, som skulde gå lige til Fønikien, gik vi
      om Bord og afsejlede.
  3.  Men da vi havde fået Kypern i Sigte og vare komne den forbi til
      venstre for os, sejlede vi til Synen og landede i Tyrus; thi der
      skulde Skibet losse sin Ladning.
  4.  Og vi opsøgte Disciplene og bleve der syv Dage; disse sagde ved
      Ånden til Paulus, at han ikke skulde drage op til Jerusalem.
  5.  Men da vi havde tilendebragt disse Dage, droge vi derfra og
      rejste videre, idet de alle, med Hustruer og Børn, ledsagede os
      uden for Byen; og efter at have knælet på Strandbredden og holdt
      Bøn
  6.  toge vi Afsked med hverandre; og vi gik om Bord i Skibet, men de
      vendte tilbage til deres Hjem.

  7.  Men vi fuldendte Sejladsen og kom fra Tyrus til Ptolemais, og vi
      hilste på Brødrene og bleve een Dag hos dem.
  8.  Og den følgende Dag droge vi derfra og kom til Kæsarea, og vi
      gik ind i Evangelisten Filips Hus, han, som var en af de syv, og
      bleve hos ham.
  9.  Men denne havde fire ugifte Døtre, som profeterede.
 10.  Men da vi bleve der flere Dage, kom der en Profet ned fra Judæa
      ved Navn Agabus.
 11.  Og han kom til os og tog Paulus's Bælte og bandt sine egne
      Fødder og Hænder og sagde: "Dette siger den Helligånd: Den Mand,
      hvem dette Bælte tilhører, skulle Jøderne binde således i
      Jerusalem og overgive i Hedningers Hænder."
 12.  Men da vi hørte dette, bade såvel vi som de der på Stedet ham om
      ikke at drage op til Jerusalem.
 13.  Da svarede Paulus: "Hvad gøre I, at I græde og gøre mit Hjerte
      modløst? thi jeg er rede til ikke alene at bindes, men også at
      dø i Jerusalem for den Herres Jesu Navns Skyld."
 14.  Da han nu ikke vilde lade sig overtale, bleve vi stille og
      sagde: "Herrens Villie ske!"

 15.  Men efter disse Dage gjorde vi os rede og droge op til
      Jerusalem.
 16.  Og også nogle af Disciplene fra Kæsarea rejste med os og bragte
      os til Mnason, en Mand fra Kypern, en gammel Discipel, hos hvem
      vi skulde have Herberge.
 17.  Da vi nu kom til Jerusalem, modtoge Brødrene os med Glæde.
 18.  Og Dagen efter gik Paulus ind med os til Jakob, og alle de
      Ældste kom derhen.
 19.  Og da han havde hilst på dem, fortalte han Stykke for Stykke,
      hvad Gud havde gjort iblandt Hedningerne ved hans Tjeneste.
 20.  Men da de hørte dette, priste de Gud og de sagde til ham:
      "Broder! du ser, hvor mange Tusinder der er af Jøderne, som have
      antaget Troen, og de ere alle nidkære for Loven.
 21.  Men de have hørt om dig, at du lærer alle Jøderne ude iblandt
      Hedningerne at falde fra Moses og siger, at de ikke skulle
      omskære Børnene, ej heller vandre efter Skikkene.
 22.  Hvad er der da at gøre? Der må sikkert komme mange Mennesker
      sammen; thi de ville få at høre, at du er kommen.
 23.  Gør derfor dette, som vi sige dig: Vi have her fire Mænd, som
      have et Løfte på sig.
 24.  Tag dem med dig, og rens dig sammen med dem,, og gør
      Omkostningen for dem, for at de kunne lade deres Hoved rage; så
      ville alle erkende, at det, som de have hørt om dig, ikke har
      noget på sig, men at du også selv vandrer således, at du holder
      Loven.
 25.  Men om de Hedninger, som ere blevne troende, have vi udsendt en
      Skrivelse med den Afgørelse, at de intet sådant skulle holde,
      men kun vogte sig for Afgudsofferkød og Blod og det kvalte og
      Utugt."
 26.  Da tog Paulus Mændene med sig næste dag, og efter at have renset
      sig sammen med dem gik han ind i Helligdommen og anmeldte
      Renselsesdagenes Udløb, da Offeret blev bragt for hver enkelt af
      dem.

 27.  Men da de syv Dage næsten vare til Ende, satte Jøderne fra
      Asien, som havde set ham i Helligdommen, hele Mængden i Oprør og
      lagde Hånd på ham
 28.  og råbte: "I israelitiske Mænd, kommer til Hjælp! Denne er det
      Menneske, som alle Vegne lærer alle imod Folket og Loven og
      dette Sted; og tilmed har han også ført Grækere ind i
      Helligdommen og gjort dette hellige Sted urent;"
 29.  de havde nemlig i Forvejen set Efesieren Trofimus i Staden
      sammen med ham, og ham mente de, at Paulus havde ført ind i
      Helligdommen.
 30.  Og hele Staden kom i Bevægelse, og Folket stimlede sammen; og de
      grebe Paulus og slæbte ham uden for Helligdommen, og straks
      bleve Dørene lukkede.
 31.  Og da de søgte at slå ham ihjel, gik der Melding op til
      Krigsøversten for Vagtafdelingen, at hele Jerusalem var i Oprør.
 32.  Han tog straks Stridsmænd og Høvedsmænd med sig og ilede ned
      imod dem. Men da de så Krigsøversten og Stridsmændene, holdt de
      op at slå Paulus.
 33.  Da trådte Krigsøversten til, greb ham og befalede, at han skulde
      bindes med to Lænker, og han spurgte, hvem han var, og hvad han
      havde gjort.
 34.  Da råbte nogle i Skaren eet, andre et andet til ham; men da han
      ikke kunde få noget pålideligt at vide på Grund af Larmen,
      befalede han at føre ham ind i Borgen,
 35.  Men da han kom på Trappen, gik det således, at han måtte bæres
      af Stridsmændene på Grund af Skarens Voldsomhed;
 36.  thi Folkemængden fulgte efter og råbte: "Bort med ham!"
 37.  Og da Paulus var ved at blive ført ind i Borgen, siger han til
      Krigsøversten: "Er det mig tilladt at sige noget til dig?" Men
      han sagde: "Forstår du Græsk?
 38.  Er du da ikke den Ægypter, som for nogen Tid siden gjorde Oprør
      og førte de fire Tusinde Stimænd ud i Ørkenen?"
 39.  Men Paulus sagde: "Jeg er en jødisk Mand fra Tarsus, Borger i en
      ikke ubekendt By i Kilikien. Men jeg beder dig, tilsted mig at
      tale til Folket!"
 40.  Og da han tilstedte det, stod Paulus frem på Trappen og slog til
      Lyd med Hånden for Folket. Men da der var blevet dyb Tavshed,
      tiltalte han dem i det hebraiske Sprog og sagde:

Apostelenes gerninger 22

  1.  " I Mænd, Brødre og Fædre! hører nu mit forsvar over for eder!"
  2.  Men da de hørte, at han talte til dem i det hebraiske Sprog,
      holdt de sig end mere stille. Og han siger:
  3.  "Jeg er en jødisk Mand, født i Tarsus i Kilikien, men opfostret
      i denne Stad, oplært ved Gamaliels Fødder efter vor Fædrenelovs
      Strenghed og nidkær for Gud, ligesom I alle ere i Dag.
  4.  Og jeg forfulgte denne Vej indtil Døden, idet jeg lagde både
      Mænd og Kvinder i Lænker og overgav dem til Fængsler,
  5.  som også Ypperstepræsten vidner med mig og hele Ældsterådet, fra
      hvem jeg endog fik Breve med til Brødrene i Damaskus og rejste
      derhen for også at føre dem, som vare der, bundne til Jerusalem,
      for at de måtte blive straffede.
  6.  Men det skete, da jeg var undervejs og nærmede mig til Damaskus,
      at ved Middag et stærkt Lys fra Himmelen pludseligt omstrålede
      mig.
  7.  Og jeg faldt til Jorden og hørte en Røst, som sagde til mig:
      Saul!  Saul! hvorfor forfølger du mig?
  8.  Men jeg svarede: Hvem er du, Herre? Og han sagde til mig: Jeg er
      Jesus af Nazareth, som du forfølger.
  9.  Men de, som vare med mig, så vel Lyset, men hørte ikke hans
      Røst, som talte til mig.
 10.  Men jeg sagde: Hvad skal jeg gøre, Herre? Men Herren sagde til
      mig: Stå op og gå til Damaskus; og der skal der blive talt til
      dig om alt, hvad der er bestemt, at du skal gøre.
 11.  Men da jeg havde mistet Synet ved Glansen af hint Lys, blev jeg
      ledet ved Hånden af dem, som vare med mig, og kom således ind i
      Damaskus.
 12.  Men en vis Ananias, en Mand, gudfrygtig efter Loven, som havde
      godt Vidnesbyrd af alle Jøderne, som boede der,
 13.  kom til mig og stod for mig og sagde: Saul, Broder, se op! Og
      jeg så op på ham i samme Stund.
 14.  Men han sagde: Vore Fædres Gud har udvalgt dig til at kende hans
      Villie og se den retfærdige og høre en Røst af hans Mund.
 15.  Thi du skal være ham et Vidne for alle Mennesker om de Ting, som
      du har set og hørt.
 16.  Og nu, hvorfor tøver du? Stå op, lad dig døbe og dine Synder
      aftvætte, idet du påkalder hans Navn!
 17.  Og det skete, da jeg var kommen tilbage til Jerusalem og bad i
      Helligdommen, at jeg faldt i Henrykkelse
 18.  og så ham, idet han sagde til mig: Skynd dig, og gå hastigt ud
      af Jerusalem, thi de skulle ikke af dig modtage Vidnesbyrd om
      mig.
 19.  Og jeg sagde: Herre! de vide selv, at jeg fængslede og piskede
      trindt om i Synagogerne dem, som troede på dig,
 20.  og da dit Vidne Stefanus's Blod blev udgydt, stod også jeg hos
      og havde Behag deri og vogtede på deres Klæder, som sloge ham
      ihjel.
 21.  Og han sagde til mig: Drag ud; thi jeg vil sende dig langt bort
      til Hedninger."

 22.  Men de hørte på ham indtil dette Ord, da opløftede de deres Røst
      og sagde: "Bort fra Jorden med en sådan! thi han bør ikke
      leve.""
 23.  Men da de skrege og reve Klæderne af sig og kastede Støv op i
      Luften,
 24.  befalede Krigsøversten, at han skulde føres ind i Borgen, og
      sagde, at man med Hudstrygning skulde forhøre ham, for at han
      kunde få at vide, af hvad Årsag de således råbte imod ham.
 25.  Men da de havde udstrakt ham for Svøberne, sagde Paulus til den
      hosstående Høvedsmand: "Er det eder tilladt at hudstryge en
      romersk Mand, og det uden Dom?"
 26.  Men da Høvedsmanden hørte dette, gik han til Krigsøversten og
      meldte ham det og sagde: "Hvad er det, du et ved at gøre? denne
      Mand er jo en Romer."
 27.  Men Krigsøversten gik hen og sagde til ham: "Sig mig, er du en
      Romer?" Han sagde: "Ja."
 28.  Og Krigsøversten svarede: "Jeg har købt mig denne Borgerret for
      en stor Sum," Men Paulus sagde: "Jeg er endog født dertil."
 29.  Da trak de, som skulde til at forhøre ham, sig straks tilbage
      fra ham. Og da Krigsøversten fik at vide, at han var en Romer,
      blev også han bange, fordi han havde bundet ham.
 30.  Men den næste Dag, da han vilde have noget pålideligt at vide
      om, hvad han anklagedes for af Jøderne, løste han ham og
      befalede, at Ypperstepræsterne og hele Rådet skulde komme
      sammen, og han førte Paulus ned og stillede ham for dem.

Apostelenes gerninger 23

  1.  Da så Paulus fast på Rådet og sagde: "I Mænd, Brødre! jeg har
      med al god Samvittighed vandret for Gud indtil denne Dag."
  2.  Men Ypperstepræsten Ananias befalede dem, som stode hos ham, at
      slå ham på Munden.
  3.  Da sagde Paulus til ham: "Gud skal slå dig, du kalkede Væg! Og
      du sidder for at dømme mig efter Loven, og tvært imod Loven
      befaler du, at jeg skal slås."
  4.  Men de, som stode hos, sagde: "Udskælder du Guds Ypperstepræst?"
  5.  Og Paulus sagde: "Brødre! jeg vidste ikke, at han er
      Ypperstepræst; thi der er skrevet: En Fyrste i dit Folk må du
      ikke tale ondt imod."
  6.  Men da Paulus vidste, at den ene Del bestod af Saddukæere, men
      den anden af Farisæere, råbte han i Rådet: "I Mænd, Brødre! jeg
      er en Farisæer, Søn af Farisæere, for Håb og for dødes
      Opstandelse er det, jeg dømmes."
  7.  Men da han udtalte dette, opkom der Splid imellem Farisæerne og
      Saddukæerne, og Mængden blev uenig.
  8.  Thi Saddukæerne sige, at der ingen Opstandelse er, ej heller
      nogen Engel eller Ånd; men Farisæerne hævde begge Dele.
  9.  Men der opstod en stærk Råben; og nogle af de skriftkloge af
      Farisæernes Parti stode op, strede heftigt og sagde: "Vi finde
      intet ondt hos dette Menneske; men hvad om en Ånd eller en Engel
      har talt til ham!"
 10.  Men da der blev stærk Splid frygtede Krigsøversten, at Paulus
      skulde blive sønderslidt af dem, og befalede Krigsfolket at gå
      ned og rive ham ud fra dem og føre ham ind i Borgen.
 11.  Men Natten derefter stod Herren for ham og sagde: "Vær frimodig,
      thi ligesom du har vidnet om mig i Jerusalem, således skal du
      også vidne i Rom."

 12.  Men da det var blevet Dag, sloge Jøderne sig sammen og
      forpligtede sig under Forbandelser til hverken at spise eller
      drikke, førend de havde slået Paulus ihjel.
 13.  Og de, som havde indgået denne Sammensværgelse, vare flere end
      fyrretyve i Tal.
 14.  Disse gik da til Ypperstepræsterne og de Ældste og sagde: "Vi
      have under Forbandelser forpligtet os til ikke at smage noget,
      førend vi have slået Paulus ihjel.
 15.  Så giver nu I tillige med Rådet Krigsøversten Meddelelse, for at
      han må føre ham ned til eder, som om I ville undersøge hans Sag
      nøjere; men vi ere rede til at slå ham ihjel, førend han kommer
      derhen."
 16.  Men Paulus's Søstersøn, som havde hørt om dette Anslag, kom og
      gik ind i Borgen og fortalte Paulus det.
 17.  Men Paulus kaldte en af Høvedsmændene til sig og sagde: "Før
      denne unge Mand hen til Krigsøversten; thi han har noget at
      melde ham."
 18.  Da tog han ham og førte ham til Krigsøversten og siger: "Den
      fangne Paulus kaldte mig og bad mig føre denne unge Mand til
      dig, da han har noget at tale med dig om."
 19.  Men Krigsøversten tog ham ved Hånden, gik hen til en Side og
      spurgte: "Hvad er det, som du har at melde mig?"
 26.  Men han sagde: "Jøderne have aftalt at bede dig om at lade
      Paulus føre ned for Rådet i Morgen under Foregivende af at ville
      have nøjere Underretning om ham.
 21.  Lad du dig nu ikke overtale af dem; thi mere end fyrretyve Mænd
      af dem lure på ham, og de have under Forbandelser forpligtet sig
      til hverken at spise eller at drikke, førend de have slået ham
      ihjel; og nu ere de rede og vente på dit Tilsagn."
 22.  Da lod Krigsøversten det unge Menneske fare og bød ham: "Du skal
      ingen sige, at du har givet mig dette til Kende."

 23.  Og han kaldte et Par af Høvedsmændene til sig og sagde: "Gører
      to Hundrede Stridsmænd rede til at drage til Kæsarea og
      halvfjerdsindstyve Ryttere og to Hundrede Spydkastere fra den
      tredje Time i Nat; "
 24.  og at de skulde bringe Lastdyr for at kunne lade Paulus ride og
      føre ham sikkert til Landshøvdingen Feliks.
 25.  Og han skrev et Brev af følgende Indhold:
 26.  "Klaudius Lysias hilser den mægtigste Landshøvding Feliks.
 27.  Denne Mand havde Jøderne grebet og vilde have slået ham ihjel;
      men jeg kom til med Krigsfolket og udfriede ham, da jeg
      erfarede, at han var en Romer.
 28.  Og da jeg vilde vide Årsagen, hvorfor de anklagede ham, førte
      jeg ham ned for deres Råd
 29.  og fandt ham anklaget i Anledning af nogle Stridsspørgsmål i
      deres Lov, men uden nogen Beskyldning, som fortjente Død eller
      Fængsel.
 30.  Men da jeg har fået Underretning om, at der skulde være et
      hemmeligt Anslag af Jøderne imod Manden, har jeg straks sendt
      ham til dig efter også at have befalet Anklagerne at fremføre
      for dig, hvad de have imod ham."
 31.  Da toge Stridsmændene Paulus, som det var dem befalet, og førte
      ham om Natten til Antipatris.
 32.  Men næste Dag lode de Rytterne drage videre med ham og vendte
      selv tilbage til Borgen.
 33.  Da hine nu kom til Kæsarea og havde overgivet Landshøvdingen
      Brevet, fremstillede de også Paulus for ham.
 34.  Men da han havde læst Brevet og spurgt, fra hvilken Provins han
      var, og havde erfaret, at han var fra Kilikien, sagde han:
 35.  "Jeg vil forhøre dig, når også dine Anklagere komme til Stede."
      Og han bød, at han skulde holdes bevogtet i Herodes's Borg.

Apostelenes gerninger 24

  1.  Men fem Dage derefter drog Ypperstepræsten Ananias ned med nogle
      Ældste og en Taler, Tertullus, og disse førte Klage for
      Landshøvdingen imod Paulus.
  2.  Da han nu var kaldt ind, begyndte Tertullus at anklage ham og
      sagde:
  3.  "At vi ved dig nyde megen Fred, og at Forbedringer i alle
      Retninger og alle Vegne skaffes dette Folk ved din Omsorg,
      mægtigste Feliks!  det erkende vi med al Taknemmelighed.
  4.  Men for at jeg ikke skal opholde dig for længe, beder jeg, at du
      efter din Mildhed vil høre os kortelig.
  5.  Vi have nemlig fundet, at denne Mand er en Pest og en
      Oprørsstifter iblandt alle Jøderne hele Verden over, samt er
      Fører for Nazaræernes Parti,
  6.  ja, han har endog forsøgt at vanhellige Helligdommen. Vi grebe
      ham da også og vilde have dømt ham efter vor Lov.
  7.  Men Krigsøversten Lysias kom til og borttog ham med megen Vold
      af vore Hænder
  8.  og bød hans Anklagere komme til dig. Af ham kan du selv, når du
      undersøger det, erfare alt det, hvorfor vi anklage ham."
  9.  Men også Jøderne stemmede i med og påstode, at dette forholdt
      sig således.

 10.  Og Paulus svarede, da Landshøvdingen gav ham et Vink, at han
      skulde tale: "Efterdi jeg ved, at du i mange År har været Dommer
      for dette Folk, vil jeg frimodigt forsvare min Sag,
 11.  da du kan forvisse dig om, at det er ikke mere end tolv Dage,
      siden jeg kom op for at tilbede i Jerusalem.
 12.  Og de have ikke fundet mig i Ordveksel med nogen eller i Færd
      med at vække Folkeopløb, hverken i Helligdommen eller i
      Synagogerne eller omkring i Staden.
 13.  Og de kunne ej heller bevise dig det, som de nu anklage mig for.
 14.  Men dette bekender jeg for dig, at jeg efter den Vej, som de
      kalde et Parti, tjener vor fædrene Gud således, at jeg tror på
      alt det, som står i Loven, og det, som er skrevet hos
      Profeterne,
 15.  og har det Håb til Gud, som også disse selv forvente, at der
      skal komme en Opstandelse både af retfærdige og af uretfærdige.
 16.  Derfor øver også jeg mig i altid at have en uskadt Samvittighed
      for Gud og Menneskene.
 17.  Men efter flere Års Forløb er jeg kommen for at bringe Almisser
      til mit Folk og Ofre,
 18.  hvad de fandt mig i Færd med, da jeg var bleven renset i
      Helligdommen, og ikke med Opløb og Larm; men det var nogle Jøder
      fra Asien,
 19.  og de burde nu være til Stede hos dig og klage, om de have noget
      på mig at sige.
 20.  Eller lad disse her selv sige, hvad Uret de have fundet hos mig,
      da jeg stod for Rådet,
 21.  uden det skulde være dette ene Ord, som jeg råbte, da jeg stod
      iblandt dem: Jeg dømmes i Dag af eder for dødes Opstandelse."

 22.  Nu udsatte Feliks Sagen, da han vidste ret god Besked om Vejen,
      og sagde: "Når Krigsøversten Lysias kommer herned, vil jeg
      påkende eders Sag."
 23.  Og han befalede Høvedsmanden, at han skulde holdes bevogtet, men
      med Lempelse, og at han ikke måtte forbyde nogen af hans egne at
      gå ham til Hånde.
 24.  Men nogle Dage efter kom Feliks med sin Hustru Drusilla, som var
      en Jødinde, og lod Paulus hente og hørte ham om Troen på Kristus
      Jesus.
 25.  Men da han talte med ham om Retfærdighed og Afholdenhed og den
      kommende Dom, blev Feliks forfærdet 6g svarede: "Gå for denne
      Gang; men når jeg får Tid, vil jeg lade dig kalde til mig."
 26.  Tillige håbede han også, at Paulus skulde give ham Penge; derfor
      lod han ham også oftere hente og samtalede med ham.
 27.  Men da to År vare forløbne, fik Feliks Porkius Festus til
      Efterfølger; og da Feliks vilde fortjene sig Tak af Jøderne, lod
      han Paulus blive tilbage i Lænker.

Apostelenes gerninger 25

  1.  Da Festus nu havde tiltrådt sit Landshøvdingembede, drog han
      efter tre Dages Forløb fra Kæsarea op til Jerusalem.
  2.  Da førte Ypperstepræsterne og de fornemste af Jøderne Klage hos
      ham imod Paulus og henvendte sig til ham,
  3.  idet de med ondt i Sinde imod Paulus bade ham om at bevise dem
      den Gunst, at han vilde lade ham hente til Jerusalem; thi de
      lurede på at slå ham ihjel på Vejen.
  4.  Da svarede Festus, at Paulus blev holdt bevogtet i Kæsarea, men
      at han selv snart vilde drage derned.
  5.  "Lad altså," sagde han, "dem iblandt eder, der have Myndighed
      dertil, drage med ned og anklage ham, dersom der er noget
      uskikkeligt ved Manden."
  6.  Og da han havde opholdt sig hos dem ikke mere end otte eller ti
      Dage, drog han ned til Kæsarea, og den næste Dag satte han sig
      på Dommersædet og befalede, at Paulus skulde føres frem.
  7.  Men da han kom til Stede, stillede de Jøder, som vare komne ned
      fra Jerusalem sig omkring ham og fremførte mange og svare
      Klagemål, som de ikke kunde bevise,
  8.  efterdi Paulus forsvarede sig og sagde: "Hverken imod Jødernes
      Lov eller imod Helligdommen eller imod Kejseren har jeg syndet i
      noget Stykke."

  9.  Men Festus. som vilde fortjene sig Tak af Jøderne, svarede
      Paulus og sagde: "Er du villig til at drage op til Jerusalem og
      der stå for min Domstol i denne Sag?"
 10.  Men Paulus sagde: "Jeg står for Kejserens Domstol, og der bør
      jeg dømmes. Jøderne har jeg ingen Uret gjort, som også du ved
      helt vel.
 11.  Dersom jeg så har Uret og har gjort noget, som fortjener Døden,
      vægrer jeg mig ikke ved at dø; men hvis det, hvorfor disse
      anklage mig, intet har på sig, da kan ingen prisgive mig til
      dem. Jeg skyder mig ind under Kejseren."
 12.  Da talte Festus med sit Råd og svarede: "Du har skudt dig ind
      under Kejseren; du skal rejse til Kejseren."

 13.  Men da nogle Dage vare forløbne, kom Kong Agrippa og Berenike
      til Kæsarea og hilste på Festus.
 14.  Og da de opholdt sig der i flere Dage, forelagde Festus Kongen
      Paulus's Sag og sagde: "Der er en Mand, efterladt af Feliks som
      Fange;
 15.  imod ham førte Jødernes Ypperstepræster og Ældste Klage, da jeg
      var i Jerusalem, og bade om Dom over ham.
 16.  Dem svarede jeg, at Romere ikke have for Skik at prisgive noget
      Menneske, førend den anklagede har Anklagerne personligt til
      Stede og får Lejlighed til at forsvare sig imod Beskyldningen.
 17.  Da de altså kom sammen her, tøvede jeg ikke, men satte mig den
      næste Dag på Dommersædet og bød, at Manden skulde føres frem.
 18.  Men da Anklagerne stode omkring ham, fremførte de ingen sådan
      Beskyldning, som jeg havde formodet;
 19.  men de havde nogle Stridsspørgsmål med ham om deres egen
      Gudsdyrkelse og om en Jesus, som er død, men som Paulus påstod
      er i Live.
 20.  Men da jeg var tvivlrådig angående Undersøgelsen heraf, sagde
      jeg, om han vilde rejse til Jerusalem og der lade denne Sag
      pådømme.
 21.  Men da Paulus gjorde Påstand på at holdes bevogtet til Kejserens
      Kendelse, befalede jeg, at han skulde holdes bevogtet, indtil
      jeg kan sende ham til Kejseren."
 22.  Da sagde Agrippa til Festus: "Jeg kunde også selv ønske at høre
      den Mand." Men han sagde: "I Morgen skal du få ham at høre."
 23.  Næste Dag altså, da Agrippa og Berenike kom med stor Pragt og
      gik ind i Forhørssalen tillige med Krigsøversterne og Byens
      ypperste Mænd, blev på Festus's Befaling Paulus ført frem.
 24.  Og Festus siger: "Kong Agrippa, og alle I Mænd, som ere med os
      til Stede! her se I ham, om hvem hele Jødernes Mængde har
      henvendt sig til mig, både i Jerusalem og her, råbende på, at
      han ikke længer bør leve.
 25.  Men jeg indså, at han intet havde gjort, som fortjente Døden, og
      da han selv skød sig ind under Kejseren, besluttede jeg at sende
      ham derhen.
 26.  Dog har jeg intet sikkert at skrive om ham til min Herre. Derfor
      lod jeg ham føre frem for eder og især for dig, Kong Agrippa!
      for at jeg kan have noget at skrive, når Undersøgelsen er sket.
 27.  Thi det synes mig urimeligt at sende en Fange uden også at
      angive Beskyldningerne imod ham."

Apostelenes gerninger 26

  1.  Men Agrippa sagde til Paulus: "Det tilstedes dig at tale om dig
      selv." Da udrakte Paulus Hånden og forsvarede sig således:
  2.  "Jeg agter mig selv lykkelig, fordi jeg i Dag skal forsvare mig
      for dig angående alle de Ting, for hvilke jeg anklages af
      Jøderne, Kong Agrippa!
  3.  navnlig fordi du er kendt med alle Jødernes Skikke og
      Stridsspørgsmål; derfor beder jeg dig om, at du tålmodigt vil
      høre mig.
  4.  Mit Levned fra Ungdommen af, som fra Begyndelsen har været ført
      iblandt mit Folk og i Jerusalem, vide alle Jøderne Besked om;
  5.  thi de kende mig i Forvejen lige fra først af (om de ellers
      ville vidne), at jeg har levet som Farisæer efter det strengeste
      Parti i vor Gudsdyrkelse.
  6.  Og nu står jeg her og dømmes for Håbet på den Forjættelse, som
      er given af Gud til vore Fædre,
  7.  og som vort Tolvstammefolk håber at nå frem til, idet de tjene
      Gud uafladeligt Nat og Dag; for dette Håbs Skyld anklages jeg af
      Jøder, o Konge!
  8.  Hvor kan det holdes for utroligt hos eder, at Gud oprejser døde?
  9.  Jeg selv mente nu også at burde gøre meget imod Jesu,
      Nazaræerens Navn,
 10.  og det gjorde jeg også i Jerusalem; og jeg indespærrede mange af
      de hellige i Fængsler, da jeg havde fået Fuldmagt dertil af
      Ypperstepræsterne, og når de bleve slåede ihjel, gav jeg min
      Stemme dertil.
 11.  Og i alle Synagogerne lod jeg dem ofte straffe og tvang dem til
      at tale bespotteligt, og rasende end mere imod dem forfulgte jeg
      dem endog til de udenlandske Byer.
 12.  Da jeg i dette Øjemed drog til Damaskus med Fuldmagt og
      Myndighed fra Ypperstepræsterne,
 13.  så jeg undervejs midt på Dagen, o Konge! et Lys fra Himmelen,
      som overgik Solens Glans, omstråle mig og dem, som rejste med
      mig.
 14.  Men da vi alle faldt til Jorden, hørte jeg en Røst, som sagde
      til mig i det hebraiske Sprog: Saul! Saul! hvorfor forfølger du
      mig? det bliver dig hårdt at stampe imod Brodden.
 15.  Og jeg sagde: Hvem er du, Herre? Men Herren sagde: Jeg er Jesus,
      som du forfølger.
 16.  Men rejs dig og stå på dine Fødder; thi derfor har jeg vist mig
      for dig, for at udkåre dig til Tjener og Vidne, både om det, som
      du har set, og om mine kommende Åbenbaringer for dig,
 17.  idet jeg udfrier dig fra Folket og fra Hedningerne, til hvilke
      jeg udsender dig
 18.  for at oplade deres Øjne, så de må omvende sig fra Mørke til Lys
      og fra Satans Magt til Gud, for at de kunne få Syndernes
      Forladelse og Lod iblandt dem, som ere helligede ved Troen på
      mig.
 19.  Derfor, Kong Agrippa! blev jeg ikke ulydig imod det himmelske
      Syn;
 20.  men jeg forkyndte både først for dem i Damaskus og så i
      Jerusalem og over hele Judæas Land og for Hedningerne, at de
      skulde fatte et andet Sind og omvende sig til Gud og gøre
      Gerninger, Omvendelsen værdige.
 21.  For denne Sags Skyld grebe nogle Jøder mig i Helligdommen og
      forsøgte at slå mig ihjel.
 22.  Det er altså ved den Hjælp, jeg har fået fra Gud, at jeg har
      stået indtil denne Dag og vidnet både for små og store, idet jeg
      intet siger ud over det, som både Profeterne og Moses have sagt
      skulde ske,
 23.  at Kristus skulde lide, at han som den første af de dødes
      Opstandelse skulde forkynde Lys både for Folket og for
      Hedningerne."
 24.  Men da han forsvarede sig således, sagde Festus med høj Røst:
      "Du raser, Paulus! den megen Lærdom gør dig rasende."
 25.  Men Paulus sagde: "Jeg raser ikke, mægtigste Festus! men jeg
      taler sande og betænksomme Ord.
 26.  Thi Kongen ved Besked om dette, og til ham taler jeg frimodigt,
      efterdi jeg er vis på, at slet intet af dette er skjult for ham;
      thi dette er ikke sket i en Vrå.
 27.  Tror du, Kong Agrippa, Profeterne? Jeg ved, at du tror dem."
 28.  Men Agrippa sagde til Paulus: "Der fattes lidet i, at du
      overtaler mig til at blive en Kristen."
 29.  Men Paulus sagde: "Jeg vilde ønske til Gud, enten der fattes
      lidet eller meget, at ikke alene du, men også alle, som høre mig
      i Dag, måtte blive sådan, som jeg selv er, på disse Lænker nær."
 30.  Da stod Kongen op og Landshøvdingen og Berenike og de, som sade
      hos dem.
 31.  Og da de gik bort, talte de med hverandre og sagde: "Denne Mand
      gør intet, som fortjener Død eller Lænker."
 32.  Men Agrippa sagde til Festus: "Denne Mand kunde være løsladt,
      dersom han ikke havde skudt sig ind under Kejseren."

Apostelenes gerninger 27

  1.  Men da det var besluttet, at vi skulde afsejle til Italien,
      overgave de både Paulus og nogle andre Fanger til en Høvedsmand
      ved Navn Julius af den kejserlige Afdeling.
  2.  Vi gik da om Bord på et adramyttisk Skib, som skulde gå til
      Stederne langs med Asiens Kyster, og vi sejlede af Sted; og
      Aristarkus, en Makedonier fra Thessalonika, var med os.
  3.  Og den næste Dag anløb vi Sidon. Og Julius, som behandlede
      Paulus venligt. tilstedte ham at gå hen til sine Venner og nyde
      Pleje.
  4.  Og vi fore bort derfra og sejlede ind under Kypern, fordi Vinden
      var imod.
  5.  Og vi sejlede igennem Farvandet ved Kilikien og Pamfylien og kom
      til Myra i Lykien.
  6.  Og der fandt Høvedsmanden et aleksandrinsk Skib, som sejlede til
      Italien, og bragte os over i det.
  7.  Men da Sejladsen i mange Dage gik langsomt, og vi med Nød og
      næppe nåede henimod Knidus (thi Vinden føjede os ikke), holdt vi
      ned under Kreta ved Salmone.
  8.  Med Nød og næppe sejlede vi der forbi og kom til et Sted, som
      kaldes "Gode Havne", nær ved Byen Lasæa.
  9.  Men da en rum Tid var forløben, og Sejladsen allerede var
      farlig, såsom endog Fasten allerede var forbi, formanede Paulus
      dem og sagde:
 10.  "I Mænd! jeg ser, at Sejladsen vil medføre Ulykke og megen
      Skade, ikke alene på Ladning og Skib, men også på vort Liv."
 11.  Men Høvedsmanden stolede mere på Styrmanden og Skipperen end på
      det, som Paulus sagde.
 12.  Og da Havnen ikke egnede sig til Vinterleje, besluttede de
      fleste, at man skulde sejle derfra, om man muligt kunde nå hen
      og overvintre i Føniks, en Havn på Kreta, som vender imod
      Sydvest og Nordvest,
 13.  Da der nu blæste en Sønden: vind op, mente de at have nået deres
      Hensigt, lettede Anker og sejlede langs med og nærmere ind under
      Kreta.
 14.  Men ikke længe derefter for der en heftig Storm ned over den,
      den såkaldte "Eurakvilo".
 15.  Og da Skibet reves med og ikke kunde holde op imod Vinden,
      opgave vi det og lode os drive.
 16.  Men da vi løb ind under en lille Ø, som kaldes Klavde, formåede
      vi med Nød og næppe at bjærge Båden.
 17.  Men efter at have trukket den op, anvendte de Nødmidler og
      omsurrede Skibet; og da de frygtede for, at de skulde blive
      kastede ned i Syrten, firede de Sejlene ned og lode sig således
      drive.
 18.  Og da vi måtte kæmpe hårdt med Stormen, begyndte de næste Dag at
      kaste over Bord.
 19.  Og på den tredje Dag udkastede de med egne Hænder Skibets
      Redskaber.
 20.  Men da hverken Sol eller Stjerner lode sig se i flere Dage, og
      vi havde et Uvejr over os; som ikke var ringe, blev fra nu af
      alt Håb om Redning os betaget.
 21.  Og da man længe ikke havde taget Føde til sig, så stod Paulus
      frem midt iblandt dem og sagde: "I Mænd! man burde have adlydt
      mig og ikke været sejlet bort fra Kreta og have sparet os denne
      Ulykke og Skade.
 22.  Og nu formaner jeg eder til at være ved godt Mod; thi ingen Sjæl
      af eder skal forgå, men alene Skibet.
 23.  Thi i denne Nat stod der en Engel hos mig fra den Gud, hvem jeg
      tilhører, hvem jeg også tjener, og sagde:
 24.  "Frygt ikke, Paulus! du skal blive stillet for Kejseren; og
      se,Gud har skænket dig alle dem, som sejle med dig."
 25.  Derfor, I Mænd! værer ved godt Mod; thi jeg har den Tillid til
      Gud, at det skal ske således, som der er blevet talt til mig.
 26.  Men vi må strande på en Ø."
 27.  Men da den fjortende Nat kom, og vi dreve i det adriatiske Hav,
      kom det Skibsfolkene for ved Midnatstid, at der var Land i
      Nærheden.
 28.  Og da de loddede, fik de tyve Favne, og da de lidt længere
      fremme atter loddede, fik de femten Favne.
 29.  Og da de frygtede, at vi skulde støde på Skær, kastede de fire
      Ankre ud fra Bagstavnen og bade til, at det måtte blive Dag.
 30.  Men da Skibsfolkene gjorde Forsøg på at flygte fra Skibet og
      firede Båden ned i Søen under Påskud af, at de vilde lægge Ankre
      ud fra Forstavnen,
 31.  da sagde Paulus til Høvedsmanden og til Stridsmændene: "Dersom
      disse ikke blive i Skibet, kunne I ikke reddes."
 32.  Da kappede Stridsmændene Bådens Tove og lode den falde ned.
 33.  Men indtil det vilde dages, formanede Paulus alle til at tage
      Næring til sig og sagde: "Det er i Dag den fjortende Dag, I have
      ventet og tilbragt uden at spise og intet taget til eder.
 34.  Derfor formaner jeg eder til at tage Næring til eder, thi dette
      hører med til eders Redning; ikke et Hår på Hovedet skal gå tabt
      for nogen af eder."
 35.  Men da han havde sagt dette, tog han Brød og takkede Gud for
      alles Øjne og brød det og begyndte at spise.
 36.  Da bleve de alle frimodige og toge også Næring til sig.
 37.  Men vi vare i Skibet i alt to Hundrede og seks og
      halvfjerdsindstyve Sjæle.
 38.  Og da de vare blevne mættede med Føde, lettede de Skibet ved at
      kaste Levnedsmidlerne i Søen.
 39.  Men da det blev Dag, kendte de ikke Landet; men de bemærkede en
      Vig med en Forstrand, som de besluttede, om muligt, at sætte
      Skibet ind på.
 40.  Og de kappede Ankrene, som de lode blive i Søen, og løste
      tillige Rortovene, og idet de satte Råsejlet til for Vinden,
      holdt de ind på Strandbredden.
 41.  Men de stødte på en Grund med dybt Vand på begge Sider, og der
      satte de Skibet, og Forstavnen borede sig fast og stod
      urokkelig, men Bagstavnen sloges sønder af Bølgernes Magt.
 42.  Det var nu Stridsmændenes Råd, at man skulde ihjelslå Fangerne,
      for at ingen skulde svømme bort og undkomme.
 43.  Men Høvedsmanden, som vilde frelse Paulus, forhindrede dem i
      dette Forehavende og bød, at de, som kunde svømme, skulde først
      kaste sig ud og slippe i Land,
 44.  og de andre bjærge sig, nogle på Brædder, andre på Stykker af
      Skibet. Og således skete det, at alle bleve reddede i Land.

Apostelenes gerninger 28

  1.  Og da vi nu vare reddede, så fik vi at vide, at Øen hed Malta.
  2.  Og Barbarerne viste os en usædvanlig Menneskekærlighed; thi de
      tændte et Bål og toge sig af os alle for den frembrydende Regns
      og Kuldens Skyld.
  3.  Men da Paulus samlede en Bunke Ris og lagde på Bålet, krøb der
      en Øgle ud på Grund af Varmen og hængte sig fast ved hans Hånd.
  4.  Da nu Barbarerne så Dyret hænge ved hans Hånd, sagde de til
      hverandre: "Sikkert er denne Mand en Morder, hvem Gengældelsen
      ikke har tilstedt at leve, skønt han er reddet fra Havet."
  5.  Men han rystede Dyret af i Ilden, og der skete ham intet ondt.
  6.  Men de ventede, at han skulde hovne op eller pludseligt falde
      død om. Men da de havde ventet længe og så, at der ikke skete
      ham noget usædvanligt, kom de på andre Tanker og sagde, at han
      var en Gud.
  7.  Men i Omegnen af dette Sted havde Øens fornemste Mand, ved Navn
      Publius, nogle Landejendomme. Han tog imod os og lånte os
      venligt Herberge i tre Dage.
  8.  Men det traf sig, at Publius's Fader lå syg af Feber og
      Blodgang.  Til ham gik Paulus ind og bad og lagde Hænderne på
      ham og helbredte ham.
  9.  Da dette var sket, kom også de andre på Øen, som havde Sygdomme,
      til ham og bleve helbredte.
 10.  De viste os også megen Ære, og da vi sejlede bort, bragte de om
      Bord i Skibet, hvad vi trængte til.

 11.  Men efter tre Måneders Forløb sejlede vi da bort i et
      aleksandrinsk Skib, som havde haft Vinterleje ved Øen og førte
      Tvillingernes Mærke.
 12.  Og vi løb ind til Syrakus, hvor vi bleve tre Dage.
 13.  Derfra sejlede vi videre og kom til Regium, og efter en Dags
      Forløb fik vi Søndenvind og kom den næste Dag til Puteoli.
 14.  Der fandt vi Brødre og bleve opfordrede til at blive hos dem i
      syv Dage. Og så droge vi til Rom.
 15.  Og Brødrene derfra, som havde hørt om os, kom os i Møde til
      Appius's Forum og Tres-Tabernæ. Og da Paulus så dem, takkede han
      Gud og fattede Mod.
 16.  Men da vi kom til Rom, (overgav Høvedsmanden Fangerne til
      Høvdingen for Livvagten. Dog) blev det tilstedt Paulus at bo for
      sig selv sammen med den Stridsmand, der bevogtede ham.

 17.  Men efter tre Dages Forløb skete det, at han sammenkaldt de
      fornemste iblandt Jøderne. Men da de vare forsamlede, sagde han
      til dem: "I Mænd, Brødre! uagtet jeg intet har gjort imod vort
      Folk eller de fædrene Skikke, er jeg fra Jerusalem overgiven som
      Fange i Romernes Hænder,
 18.  og disse vilde efter at have forhørt mig løslade mig, efterdi
      der ikke var nogen Dødsskyld hos mig.
 19.  Men da Jøderne gjorde Indsigelse, nødtes jeg til at skyde mig
      ind under Kejseren, dog ikke, som om jeg havde noget at anklage
      mit Folk for.
 20.  Af denne Årsag har jeg altså ladet eder kalde hid for at se og
      tale med eder; thi for Israels Håbs Skyld er jeg sluttet i denne
      Lænke."
 21.  Men de sagde til ham: "Hverken have vi fået Brev fra Judæa om
      dig, ikke heller er nogen af Brødrene kommen og har meddelt
      eller sagt noget ondt om dig.
 22.  Men vi ønske at høre af dig, hvad du tænker; thi om dette Parti
      er det os bekendt, at det alle Vegne finder Modsigelse."
 23.  Efter så at have aftalt en Dag med ham, kom de til ham i
      Herberget i større Tal, og for dem forklarede han og vidnede om
      Guds Rige og søgte at overbevise dem om Jesus, både ud af Mose
      Lov og af Profeterne, fra årle om Morgenen indtil Aften.
 24.  Og nogle lode sig overbevise af det, som blev sagt, men andre
      troede ikke.
 25.  Og under indbyrdes Uenighed gik de bort, da Paulus havde sagt
      dette ene Ord: "Rettelig har den Helligånd talt ved Profeten
      Esajas til eders Fædre og sagt:
 26.  "Gå hen til dette Folk og sig: I skulle høre med eders Øren og
      ikke forstå og se med eders Øjne og ikke se;
 27.  thi dette Folks Hjerte er blevet sløvet, og med Ørene høre de
      tungt, og deres Øjne have de tillukket, for at de ikke skulle se
      med Øjnene og høre med Ørene og forstå med Hjertet og omvende
      sig, så jeg kunde helbrede dem."
 28.  Derfor være det eder vitterligt, at denne Guds Frelse er sendt
      til Hedningerne; de skulle også høre."
 29.  Og da han havde sagt dette, gik Jøderne bort, og der var stor
      Trætte imellem dem indbyrdes.
 30.  Men han blev hele to År i sit lejede Herberge og modtog alle,
      som kom til ham,
 31.  idet han prædikede Guds Rige og lærte om den Herre Jesus med al
      Frimodighed, uhindret.


Romerne

Romerne 1

  1.  Paulus, Jesu Kristi Tjener, Apostel ifølge Kald, udtagen til at
      forkynde Guds Evangelium,
  2.  hvilket han forud forjættede ved sine Profeter i hellige
      Skrifter,
  3.  om hans Søn, født af Davids Sæd efter Kødet,
  4.  kraftelig bevist som Guds Søn efter Helligheds Ånd ved
      Opstandelse fra de døde, Jesus Kristus, vor Herre,
  5.  ved hvem vi have fået Nåde og Apostelgerning til at virke
      Tros-Lydighed iblandt alle Hedningerne for hans Navns Skyld,
  6.  iblandt hvilke også I ere Jesu Kristi kaldede:
  7.  Til alle Guds elskede, som ere i Rom, kaldede hellige. Nåde være
      med eder og Fred fra Gud vor Fader og den Herre Jesus Kristus!

  8.  Først takker jeg min Gud ved Jesus Kristus for eder alle, fordi
      eders Tro omtales i den hele Verden.
  9.  Thi Gud er mit Vidne, hvem jeg i min Ånd tjener i hans Søns
      Evangelium, hvor uafladeligt jeg kommer eder i Hu,
 10.  idet jeg bestandig i mine Bønner beder om, at jeg dog endelig
      engang måtte få Lykke til Ved Guds Villie at komme til eder.
 11.  Thi jeg længes efter at se eder, for at jeg kunde meddele eder
      nogen åndelig Nådegave, for at I måtte styrkes,
 12.  det vil sige, for sammen at opmuntres hos eder ved hinandens
      Tro, både eders og min.
 13.  Og jeg vil ikke, Brødre! at I skulle være uvidende om, at jeg
      ofte har sat mig for at komme til eder (men hidindtil er jeg
      bleven forhindret), for at jeg måtte få nogen Frugt også iblandt
      eder, ligesom iblandt de øvrige Hedninger.
 14.  Både til Grækere og Barbarer, både til vise og uforstandige står
      jeg i Gæld.
 15.  således er jeg, hvad mig angår, redebon til at forkynde
      Evangeliet også for eder, som ere i Rom.
 16.  Thi jeg skammer mig ikke ved Evangeliet; thi det er en Guds
      Kraft til Frelse for hver den, som tror, både for Jøde først og
      for Græker.
 17.  Thi deri åbenbares Guds Retfærdighed af Tro for Tro, som der er
      skrevet: "Men den retfærdige skal leve af Tro."

 18.  Thi Guds Vrede åbenbares fra Himmelen over al Ugudelighed og
      Uretfærdighed hos Mennesker, som holde Sandheden nede ved
      Uretfærdighed;
 19.  thi det, som man kan vide om Gud, er åbenbart iblandt dem; Gud
      har jo åbenbaret dem det.
 20.  Thi hans usynlige Væsen, både hans evige Kraft og
      Guddommelighed, skues fra Verdens Skabelse af, idet det forstås
      af hans Gerninger, så at de have ingen Undskyldning.
 21.  Thi skønt de kendte Gud, så ærede eller takkede de ham dog ikke
      som Gud, men bleve tåbelige i deres Tanker, og deres
      uforstandige Hjerte blev formørket.
 22.  Idet de påstode at være vise, bleve de Dårer
 23.  og omskiftede den uforkrænkelige Guds Herlighed med et Billede i
      Lighed med et forkrænkeligt Menneske og Fugle og firføddede og
      krybende dyr.

 24.  Derfor gav Gud dem hen i deres Hjerters Begæringer til Urenhed,
      til at vanære deres Legemer indbyrdes,
 25.  de, som ombyttede Guds Sandhed med Løgnen og dyrkede og tjente
      Skabningen fremfor Skaberen, som er højlovet i Evighed! Amen.
 26.  Derfor gav Gud dem hen i vanærende Lidenskaber; thi både deres
      Kvinder ombyttede den naturlige Omgang med den unaturlige,
 27.  og ligeså forlode også Mændene den naturlige Omgang med Kvinden
      og optændtes ideres Brynde efter hverandre, så at Mænd øvede
      Uterlighed med Mænd og fik deres Vildfarelses Løn, som det burde
      sig, på sig selv.
 28.  Og ligesom de forkastede af have Gud i Erkendelse, således gav
      Gud dem hen i et forkasteligt Sind til at gøre det usømmelige,
 29.  opfyldte med al Uretfærdighed, Ondskab, Havesyge, Slethed; fulde
      af Avind, Mord, Kiv, Svig, Ondsindethed;
 30.  Øretudere, Bagvaskere, Gudshadere, Voldsmænd, hovmodige;
      Pralere, opfindsomme på ondt, ulydige mod Forældre,
 31.  uforstandige, troløse, ukærlige, ubarmhjertige;
 32.  - hvilke jo, skønt de erkende Guds retfærdige Dom, at de, der
      øve sådanne Ting, fortjene Døden, dog ikke alene gøre det, men
      også give dem, som øve det, deres Bifald.

Romerne 2

  1.  Derfor er du uden Undskyldning, o Menneske! hvem du end er, som
      dømmer; thi idet du dømmer den anden, fordømmer du dig selv; thi
      du, som dømmer, øver det samme.
  2.  Vi vide jo, at Guds Dom er, stemmende med Sandhed, over dem, som
      øve sådanne Ting.
  3.  Men du, o Menneske! som dømmer dem, der øve sådanne Ting, og
      selv gør dem, mener du dette, at du skal undfly Guds Dom?
  4.  Eller foragter du hans Godheds og Tålmodigheds og Langmodigheds
      Rigdom og ved ikke, at Guds Godhed leder dig til Omvendelse?
  5.  Men efter din Hårdhed og dit ubodfærdige Hjerte samler du dig
      selv Vrede på Vredens og Guds retfærdige Doms Åbenbarelses Dag,
  6.  han, som vil betale enhver efter hans Gerninger:
  7.  dem, som med Udholdenhed i god Gerning søge Ære og Hæder og
      Uforkrænkelighed, et evigt Liv;
  8.  men over dem, som søge deres eget og ikke lyde Sandheden, men
      adlyde Uretfærdigheden, skal der komme Vrede og Harme.
  9.  Trængsel og Angst over hvert Menneskes Sjæl, som øver det onde,
      både en Jødes først og en Grækers;
 10.  men Ære og Hæder og Fred over hver den, som gør det gode, både
      en Jøde først og en Græker!

 11.  Thi der er ikke Persons Anseelse hos Gud.
 12.  Thi alle de, som have syndet uden Loven, de skulle også fortabes
      uden Loven; og alle de, som have syndet under Loven, de skulle
      dømmes ved Loven;
 13.  thi ikke Lovens Hørere ere retfærdige for Gud, men Lovens Gørere
      skulle retfærdiggøres
 14.  thi når Hedninger, som ikke have Loven, af Naturen gøre, hvad
      Loven kræver, da ere disse; uden at have Loven sig selv en Lov;
 15.  de vise jo Lovens Gerning skreven i deres Hjerter, idet deres
      Samvittighed vidner med, og Tankerne indbyrdes anklage eller
      også forsvare hverandre
 16.  på den Dag, da Gud vil dømme Menneskenes skjulte Færd ifølge mit
      Evangelium ved Jesus Kristus.
 17.  Men når du kalder dig Jøde og forlader dig trygt på Loven og
      roser dig af Gud
 18.  og kender hans Villie og værdsætter de forskellige Ting, idet du
      undervises af Loven,
 19.  og trøster dig til at være blindes Vejleder, et Lys for dem, som
      ere i Mørke,
 20.  uforstandiges Opdrager, umyndiges Lærer, idet du i Loven har
      Udtrykket for Erkendelsen og Sandheden,
 21.  du altså som lærer andre, du lærer ikke dig selv! Du, som
      prædiker, at man ikke må stjæle, du stjæler!.
 22.  Du, som siger, at man ikke må bedrive Hor, du bedriver Hor! Du,
      som føler Afsky for Afguderne, du øver Tempelran!
 23.  Du, som roser dig af Loven, du vanærer Gud ved Overtrædelse af
      Loven!
 24.  Thi "for eders Skyld bespottes Guds Navn iblandt Hedningerne",
      som der er skrevet.

 25.  Thi vel gavner Omskærelse, om du holder Loven; men er du Lovens
      Overtræder, da er din Omskærelse bleven til Forhud.
 26.  Dersom nu Forhuden holder Lovens Forskrifter, vil da ikke hans
      Forhud blive regnet som Omskærelse?
 27.  Og når den af Natur uomskårne opfylder Loven, skal han dømme
      dig, som med Bogstav og Omskærelse er Lovens Overtræder.
 28.  Thi ikke den er Jøde, som er det i det udvortes, ej heller er det
      Omskærelse, som sker i det udvortes, i Kød;
 29.  men den, som indvortes er Jøde, og Hjertets Omskærelse i Ånd,
      ikke i Bogstav - hans Ros er ikke af Mennesker, men af Gud,

Romerne 3

  1.  Hvad er da Jødens Fortrin? eller hvad gavner Omskærelsen?
  2.  Meget alle Måder; først nemlig dette, at Guds Ord ere blevne dem
      betroede.
  3.  Thi hvad? om nogle vare utro, skal da deres Utroskab gøre Guds
      Trofasthed til intet?
  4.  Det være langt fra! Gud må være sanddru, om end hvert Menneske
      er en Løgner, som der er skrevet: "For at du må kendes retfærdig
      i dine Ord og vinde, når du går i Rette."
  5.  Men dersom vor Uretfærdighed beviser Guds Retfærdighed, hvad
      skulle vi da sige? er Gud da uretfærdig, han, som lader sin
      Vrede komme? (Jeg taler efter menneskelig Vis).
  6.  Det være langt fra! Thi hvorledes skal Gud ellers kunne dømme
      Verden?
  7.  Men dersom Guds Sanddruhed ved min Løgn er bleven ham end mere
      til Forherligelse, hvorfor dømmes da jeg endnu som en Synder?
  8.  Og hvorfor skulde vi da ikke, som man bagvasker os for, og som
      nogle sige, at vi lære, gøre det onde, for at det gode kan komme
      deraf? Sådannes Dom er velforskyldt.

  9.  Hvad da? have vi noget forud? Aldeles ikke; vi have jo ovenfor
      anklaget både Jøder og Grækere for alle at være under Synd,
 10.  som der er skrevet: "Der er ingen retfærdig, end ikke een;
 11.  der er ingen forstandig, der er ingen, som søger efter Gud;
 12.  alle ere afvegne, til Hobe ere de blevne uduelige, der er ingen,
      som øver Godhed, der er end ikke een."
 13.  "En åbnet Grav er deres Strube; med deres Tunger øvede de Svig;"
      "der er Slangegift under deres Læber;"
 14.  "deres Mund er fuld af Forbandelse og Beskhed;"
 15.  "rappe ere deres Fødder til at udøse Blod;
 16.  der er Ødelæggelse og Elendighed på deres Veje,
 17.  og Freds Vej have de ikke kendt."
 18.  "Der er ikke Gudsfrygt for deres Øjne."
 19.  Men vi vide, at alt, hvad Loven siger, taler den til dem, som
      ere under Loven, for at hver Mund skal stoppes og hele Verden
      blive strafskyldig for Gud,
 20.  efterdi intet Kød vil blive retfærdiggjort for ham af Lovens
      Gerninger; thi ved Loven kommer Erkendelse af Synd.

 21.  Men nu er uden Lov Guds Retfærdighed åbenbaret, om hvilken der
      vidnes af Loven og Profeterne.
 22.  nemlig Guds Retfærdighed ved Tro på Jesus Kristus, for alle og
      over alle dem, som tro; thi der er ikke Forskel.
 23.  Alle have jo syndet, og dem fattes Æren fra Gud,
 24.  og de blive retfærdiggjorte uforskyldt af hans Nåde ved den
      Forløsning, som er i Kristus Jesus,
 25.  hvem Gud fremstillede som Sonemiddel ved Troen på hans Blod for
      at vise sin Retfærdighed, fordi Gud i sin Langmodighed havde
      båret over med de forhen begåede Synder,
 26.  for at vise sin Retfærdighed i den nærværende Tid, for at han
      kunde være retfærdig og retfærdiggøre den, som er af Tro på
      Jesus.

 27.  Hvor er så vor Ros? Den er udelukket. Ved hvilken Lov?
      Gerningernes? Nej, men ved Troens Lov.
 28.  Vi holde nemlig for, at Mennesket bliver retfærdiggjort ved Tro,
      uden Lovens Gerninger.
 29.  Eller er Gud alene Jøders Gud? mon ikke også Hedningers? Jo,
      også Hedningers;
 30.  så sandt som Gud er een og vil retfærdiggøre omskårne af Tro og
      uomskårne ved Troen.
 31.  Gøre vi da Loven til intet ved Troen? Det være langt fra! Nej,
      vi hævde Loven.

Romerne 4

  1.  Hvad skulle vi da sige, at vor Stamfader Abraham har vundet
      efter Kødet?
  2.  Thi dersom Abraham blev retfærdiggjort af Gerninger, har han
      Ros, men ikke for Gud.
  3.  Thi hvad siger Skriften?"Og Abraham troede Gud, og det blev
      regnet ham til Retfærdighed."
  4.  Men den, som gør Gerninger, tilregnes Lønnen ikke som Nåde, men
      som Skyldighed;
  5.  den derimod, som ikke gør Gerninger, men tror på ham, som
      retfærdiggør den ugudelige, regnes hans Tro til Retfærdighed;
  6.  ligesom også David priser det Menneske saligt, hvem Gud
      tilregner Retfærdighed uden Gerninger:
  7.  "Salige de, hvis Overtrædelser ere forladte, og hvis Synder ere
      skjulte;
  8.  salig den Mand, hvem Herren ikke vil tilregne Synd."

  9.  Gælder da denne Saligprisning de omskårne eller tillige de
      uomskårne? Vi sige jo: Troen blev regnet Abraham til
      Retfærdighed.
 10.  Hvorledes blev den ham da tilregnet? da han var omskåren, eller
      da han havde Forhud? Ikke da han var omskåren, men da han havde
      Forhud.
 11.  Og han fik Omskærelsens Tegn som et Segl på den Troens
      Retfærdighed, som han havde som uomskåren, for at han skulde
      være Fader til alle dem, som tro uden at være omskårne, for at
      Retfærdighed kan blive dem tilregnet,
 12.  og Fader til omskårne,til dem, som ikke alene have Omskærelse,
      men også vandre i den Tros Spor, hvilken vor Fader Abraham havde
      som uomskåren.

 13.  Thi ikke ved Lov fik Abraham eller hans Sæd den Forjættelse, at
      han skulde være Arving til Verden, men ved Tros-Retfærdighed.
 14.  Thi dersom de, der ere af Loven, ere Arvinger, da er Troen
      bleven tom, og Forjættelsen gjort til intet.
 15.  Thi Loven virker Vrede; men hvor der ikke er Lov, er der heller
      ikke Overtrædelse.
 16.  Derfor er det af Tro, for at det skal være som Nåde, for at
      Forjættelsen må stå fast for den hele Sæd, ikke alene for den af
      Loven, men også for den af Abrahams Tro, han, som er Fader til
      os alle
 17.  (som der er skrevet: "Jeg har sat dig til mange Folkeslags
      Fader"), over for Gud, hvem han troede, ham, som levendegør de
      døde og kalder det, der ikke er, som om det var.
 18.  Og han troede imod Håb med Håb på, at, han skulde blive mange
      Folkeslags Fader, efter det, som var sagt: "Således skal din Sæd
      være;"
 19.  og uden at blive svag i Troen så han på sit eget allerede
      udlevede Legeme (han var nær hundrede År) og på, at Saras
      Moderliv var udlevet;
 20.  men om Guds Forjættelse tvivlede han ikke i Vantro, derimod blev
      han styrket i Troen, idet han gav Gud Ære
 21.  og var overbevist om, at hvad han har forjættet, er han mægtig
      til også at gøre.
 22.  Derfor blev det også regnet ham til Retfærdighed.
 23.  Men det blev, ikke skrevet for hans Skyld alene, at det blev ham
      tilregnet,
 24.  men også for vor Skyld, hvem det skal tilregnes, os, som tro på
      ham, der oprejste Jesus, vor Herre, fra de døde,
 25.  ham, som blev hengiven for vore Overtrædelsers Skyld og oprejst
      for vor Retfærdiggørelses Skyld.

Romerne 5

  1.  Altså retfærdiggjorte af Tro have vi Fred med Gud ved vor Herre
      Jesus Krist,
  2.  ved hvem vi også have fået Adgang ved Troen til denne Nåde,
      hvori vi stå, og vi rose os af Håb om Guds Herlighed;
  3.  ja, ikke det alene, men vi rose os også af Trængslerne, idet vi
      vide, at Trængselen virker Udholdenhed,
  4.  men Udholdenheden Prøvethed, men Prøvetheden Håb,
  5.  men Håbet beskæmmer ikke; thi Guds Kærlighed er udøst i vore
      Hjerter ved den Helligånd, som blev given os.
  6.  Thi medens vi endnu vare kraftesløse, døde Kristus til den
      bestemte Tid for ugudelige.
  7.  Næppe vil nemlig nogen dø for en retfærdig - for den gode var
      der jo måske nogen, som tog sig på at dø -,
  8.  men Gud beviser sin Kærlighed over for os, ved at Kristus døde
      for os, medens vi endnu vare Syndere.
  9.  Så meget mere skulle vi altså, da vi nu ere blevne
      retfærdiggjorte ved hans Blod, frelses ved ham fra Vreden.
 10.  Thi når vi, da vi vare Fjender, bleve forligte med Gud ved hans
      Søns Død, da skulle vi meget mere, efter at vi ere blevne
      forligte, frelses ved hans Liv,
 11.  ja, ikke det alene, men også således, at vi rose os af Gud ved
      vor Herre Jesus Kristus, ved hvem vi nu have fået Forligelsen.

 12.  Derfor, ligesom Synden kom ind i Verden ved eet Menneske, og
      Døden ved Synden, og Døden således trængte igennem til alle
      Mennesker, efterdi de syndede alle
 13.  thi inden Loven var der Synd i Verden; men Synd tilregnes ikke.
      hvor der ikke er Lov;
 14.  dog herskede Døden fra Adam til Moses også over dem, som ikke
      syndede i Lighed med Adams Overtrædelse, han, som er et
      Forbillede på den, der skulde komme.
 15.  Men det er ikke således med Nådegaven som med Faldet; thi døde
      de mange ved den enes Fald, da har meget mere Guds Nåde og Gaven
      i det ene Menneskes Jesu Kristi Nåde udbredt sig overflødig, til
      de mange.
 16.  Og Gaven er ikke som igennem en enkelt, der syndede; thi Dommen
      blev ud fra en enkelt til Fordømmelse, men Nådegaven blev ud fra
      mange Fald til Retfærdiggørelse.
 17.  Thi når på Grund af dennes Fald Døden herskede ved den ene, da
      skulle meget mere de, som modtage den overvættes Nåde og
      Retfærdigheds Gave, herske i Liv ved den ene, Jesus Kristus.
 18.  Altså, ligesom det ved eens Fald blev for alle Mennesker til
      Fordømmelse, således også ved eens Retfærdighed for alle
      Mennesker til Retfærdiggørelse til Liv.
 19.  Thi ligesom ved det ene Menneskes Ulydighed de mange bleve til
      Syndere, så skulle også ved den enes Lydighed de mange blive til
      retfærdige.

 20.  Men Loven kom til, for at Faldet kunde blive større; men hvor
      Synden blev større, der blev Nåden end mere overvættes,
 21.  for at, ligesom Synden herskede ved Døden, således også Nåden
      skulde herske ved Retfærdighed til et evigt Liv ved Jesus
      Kristus, vor Herre.

Romerne 6

  1.  Hvad skulle vi da sige? skulde vi blive ved i Synden, for at
      Nåden kunde blive desto større?
  2.  Det være langt fra! Vi, som jo ere døde fra Synden, hvorledes
      skulle vi endnu leve i den?
  3.  Eller vide I ikke, at vi, så mange som bleve døbte til Kristus
      Jesus, bleve døbte til hans Død?
  4.  Vi bleve altså begravne med ham ved Dåben til Døden, for at,
      ligesom Kristus blev oprejst fra de døde ved Faderens Herlighed,
      således også vi skulle vandre i et nyt Levned.
  5.  Thi ere vi blevne sammenvoksede med ham ved hans Døds Afbillede,
      skulle vi dog også være det ved hans Opstandelses,
  6.  idet vi erkende dette, at vort gamle Menneske blev korsfæstet
      med ham, for at Syndens Legeme skulde blive til intet, for at vi
      ikke mere skulde tjene Synden.
  7.  Thi den, som er død, er retfærdiggjort fra Synden.
  8.  Men dersom vi ere døde med Kristus, da tro vi, at vi også skulle
      leve med ham,
  9.  efterdi vi vide, at Kristus, efter at være oprejst fra de døde,
      ikke mere dør; Døden hersker ikke mere over ham.
 10.  Thi det, han døde, døde han een Gang fra Synden; men det, han
      lever, lever han for Gud.
 11.  Således skulle også I anse eder selv for døde fra Synden, men
      levende for Gud i Kristus Jesus.
 12.  Så lad da ikke Synden herske i eders dødelige Legeme, så I lyde
      dets Begæringer;
 13.  fremstiller ej heller eders Lemmer for Synden som Uretfærdigheds
      Våben; men fremstiller eder selv for Gud som sådanne, der fra
      døde ere blevne levende,og eders Lemmer som Retfærdigheds Våben
      for Gud.
 14.  Thi Synd skal ikke herske over eder I ere jo ikke under Lov, men
      under Nåde.

 15.  Hvad da? skulde vi Synde, fordi vi ikke ere under Lov, men under
      Nåde? Det være langt fra!
 16.  Vide I ikke, at når I fremstille eder for en som Tjenere til
      Lydighed, så ere I hans Tjenere, hvem I lyde, enten Syndens til
      Død, eller Lydighedens til Retfærdighed?
 17.  Men Gud ske Tak, fordi I have været Syndens Tjenere, men bleve
      af Hjertet lydige imod den Læreform, til hvilken I bleve
      overgivne.
 18.  Og frigjorde fra Synden bleve I Retfærdighedens Tjenere.
 19.  Jeg taler på menneskelig Vis på Grund af eders Køds
      Skrøbelighed. Ligesom I nemlig fremstillede eders Lemmer som
      Tjenere for Urenheden og Lovløsheden til Lovløshed, således
      fremstiller nu eders Lemmer som Tjenere for Retfærdigheden, til
      Helliggørelse!
 20.  Thi da I vare Syndens Tjenere, vare I frie over for
      Retfærdigheden.
 21.  Hvad for Frugt havde I da dengang? Ting, ved hvilke I nu skamme
      eder; Enden derpå er jo Død.
 22.  Men nu, da I ere blevne frigjorde fra Synden og ere blevne Guds
      Tjenere, have I eders Frugt til Helliggørelse og som Enden derpå
      et evigt Liv;
 23.  thi Syndens Sold er Død, men Guds Nådegave er et evigt Liv i
      Kristus Jesus, vor Herre.

Romerne 7

  1.  Eller vide I ikke, Brødre! (thi jeg taler til sådanne, som
      kender Loven) at Loven hersker over Mennesket, så lang Tid han
      lever?
  2.  Den gifte Kvinde er jo ved Loven bunden til sin Mand, medens han
      lever; men når Manden dør, er hun løst fra Mandens Lov.
  3.  Derfor skal hun kaldes en Horkvinde, om hun bliver en anden
      Mands, medens Manden lever: men når Manden dør, er hun fri fra
      den Lov, så at hun ikke er en Horkvinde, om hun bliver en anden
      Mands.
  4.  Altså ere også I, mine Brødre! gjorte døde for Loven ved Kristi
      Legeme, for at I skulle blive en andens, hans, som blev oprejst
      fra de døde, for at vi skulle bære Frugt for Gud.
  5.  Thi da vi vare i Kødet, vare de syndige Lidenskaber, som vaktes
      ved Loven, virksomme i vore Lemmer til at bære Frugt for Døden,
  6.  Men nu ere vi løste fra Loven, idet vi ere bortdøde fra det,
      hvori vi holdtes nede, så at vi tjene i Åndens nye Væsen og ikke
      i Bogstavens gamle Væsen.

  7.  Hvad skulle vi da sige? er Loven Synd? Det være langt fra! Men
      jeg kendte ikke Synden uden ved Loven; thi jeg kendte jo ikke
      Begæringen, hvis ikke Loven sagde: "Du må ikke begære."
  8.  Men da Synden fik Anledning, virkede den ved Budet al Begæring i
      mig; thi uden Lov er Synden død.
  9.  Og jeg levede engang uden Lov, men da Budet kom, levede Synden
      op;
 10.  men jeg døde, og Budet, som var til Liv, det fandtes at blive
      mig til Død;
 11.  thi idet Synden fik Anledning, forførte den mig ved Budet og
      dræbte mig ved det.
 12.  Altså er Loven vel hellig, og Budet helligt og retfærdigt og
      godt.
 13.  Blev da det gode mig til Død? Det være langt fra! Men Synden
      blev det, for at den skulde vise sig som Synd, idet den ved det
      gode virkede Død for mig, for at Synden ved Budet skulde blive
      overvættes syndig.
 14.  Thi vi vide, at Loven er åndelig; men jeg er kødelig, solgt
      under Synden.
 15.  Thi jeg forstår ikke, hvad jeg udfører; thi ikke det, som jeg
      vil, øver jeg, men hvad jeg hader, det gør jeg.
 16.  Men når jeg gør det, jeg ikke vil, så samstemmer jeg med Loven
      i, at den er god.
 17.  Men nu er det ikke mere mig, som udfører det, men Synden, som
      bor i mig.
 18.  Thi jeg ved, at i mig, det vil sige i mit Kød, bor der ikke
      godt; thi Villien har jeg vel, men at udføre det gode formår jeg
      ikke;
 19.  thi det gode, som jeg vil, det gør jeg ikke; men det onde, som
      jeg ikke vil, det øver jeg.
 20.  Dersom jeg da gør det, som jeg ikke vil, så er det ikke mere
      mig, der udfører det, men Synden, som bor i mig.
 21.  Så finder jeg da den Lov for mig, som vil gøre det gode, at det
      onde ligger mig for Hånden
 22.  Thi jeg glæder mig ved Guds Lov efter det indvortes Menneske;
 23.  men jeg ser en anden Lov i mine Lemmer, som strider imod mit
      Sinds Lov og tager mig fangen under Syndens Lov, som er i mine
      Lemmer.
 24.  Jeg elendige Menneske! hvem skal fri mig fra dette Dødens
      Legeme?
 25.  Gud ske Tak ved Jesus Kristus, vor Herre! Altså: jeg selv tjener
      med Sindet Guds Lov, men med Kødet Syndens Lov.

Romerne 8

  1.  Så er der da nu ingen Fordømmelse for dem, som ere i Kristus
      Jesus.
  2.  Thi Livets Ånds Lov frigjorde mig i Kristus Jesus fra Syndens og
      Dødens Lov.
  3.  Thi det, som var Loven umuligt, det, hvori den var afmægtig ved
      Kødet, det gjorde Gud, idet han sendte sin egen Søn i syndigt
      Køds Lighed og for Syndens Skyld og således domfældte Synden i
      Kødet,
  4.  for at Lovens Krav skulde opfyldes i os, som ikke vandre efter
      Kødet, men efter Ånden.
  5.  Thi de, som lade sig lede af Kødet, hige efter det kødelige; men
      de, som lade sig lede af Ånden, hige efter det åndelige.
  6.  Thi Kødets Higen er Død, men Åndens Higen er Liv og Fred,
  7.  efterdi Kødets Higen er Fjendskab imod Gud, thi det er ikke Guds
      Lov lydigt, det kan jo ikke heller være det.
  8.  Og de, som ere i Kødet, kunne ikke tækkes Gud.
  9.  I derimod ere ikke i Kødet, men i Ånden, om ellers Guds Ånd bor
      i eder. Men om nogen ikke har Kristi Ånd, så hører han ham ikke
      til.
 10.  Men om Kristus er i eder, da er vel Legemet dødt på Grund at
      Synd, men Ånden er Liv på Grund af Retfærdighed.
 11.  Men om hans Ånd, der oprejste Jesus fra de døde, bor i eder, da
      skal han, som oprejste Kristus fra de døde, levendegøre også
      eders dødelige Legemer ved sin Ånd, som bor i eder.

 12.  Altså, Brødre! ere vi ikke Kødets Skyldnere, så at vi skulde
      leve efter Kødet;
 13.  thi dersom I leve efter Kødet, skulle I dø, men dersom l ved
      Ånden døde Legemets Gerninger, skulle I leve.
 14.  Thi så mange som drives af Guds Ånd, disse ere Guds Børn.
 15.  I modtoge jo ikke en Trældoms Ånd atter til Frygt, men I modtoge
      en Sønneudkårelses Ånd, i hvilken vi råbe: Abba, Fader!
 16.  Ånden selv vidner med vor Ånd, at vi ere Guds Børn.
 17.  Men når vi ere Børn, ere vi også Arvinger, Guds Arvinger og
      Kristi Medarvinger, om ellers vi lide med ham for også at
      herliggøres med ham.

 18.  Thi jeg holder for, at den nærværende Tids Lidelser ikke ere at
      regne imod den Herlighed, som skal åbenbares på os.
 19.  Thi Skabningens Forlængsel venter på Guds Børns Åbenbarelse.
 20.  Thi Skabningen blev underlagt Forfængeligheden, ikke med sin
      Villie, men for hans Skyld, som lagde den derunder,
 21.  med Håb om, at også Skabningen selv skal blive frigjort fra
      Forkrænkelighedens Trældom til Guds Børns Herligheds Frihed.
 22.  Thi vi vide, at hele Skabningen tilsammen sukker og er tilsammen
      i Veer indtil nu.
 23.  Dog ikke det alene, men også vi selv, som have Åndens
      Førstegrøde, også vi sukke ved os selv, idet vi forvente en
      Sønneudkårelse, vort Legemes Forløsning.
 24.  Thi i Håbet bleve vi frelste. Men et Håb, som ses, er ikke et
      Håb; thi hvad en ser, hvor kan han tillige håbe det?
 25.  Men dersom vi håbe det, som vi ikke se, da forvente vi det med
      Udholdenhed.
 26.  Og ligeledes kommer også Ånden vor Skrøbelighed til Hjælp; thi
      vi vide ikke, hvad vi skulle bede om, som det sig bør, men Ånden
      selv går i Forbøn for os med uudsigelige Sukke.
 27.  Og han, som ransager Hjerterne, ved, hvad Åndens Higen er, at
      den efter Guds Villie går i Forbøn for hellige.

 28.  Men vi vide, at alle Ting samvirke til gode for dem, som elske
      Gud, dem, som efter hans Beslutning ere kaldede.
 29.  Thi dem, han forud kendte, forudbestemte han også til at blive
      ligedannede med hans Søns Billede, for at han kunde være
      førstefødt iblandt mange Brødre.
 30.  Men dem, han forudbestemte, dem kaldte han også; og dem, han
      kaldte, dem retfærdiggjorde han også; men dem, han
      retfærdiggjorde, dem herliggjorde han også.

 31.  Hvad skulle vi da sige til dette? Er Gud for os, hvem kan da
      være imod os?
 32.  Han, som jo ikke sparede sin egen Søn, men gav ham hen for os
      alle, hvorledes skulde han ikke også med ham skænke os alle
      Ting?
 33.  Hvem vil anklage Guds udvalgte? Gud er den, som retfærdiggør.
 34.  Hvem er den, som fordømmer? Kristus er den, som er død, ja,
      meget mere, som er oprejst, som er ved Guds højre Hånd, som også
      går i Forbøn for os.
 35.  Hvem skal kunne skille os fra Kristi Kærlighed? Trængsel eller
      Angst eller Forfølgelse eller Hunger eller Nøgenhed eller Fare
      eller Sværd?
 36.  som der er skrevet: "For din Skyld dræbes vi den hele Dag, vi
      bleve regnede som Slagtefår."
 37.  Men i alt dette mere end sejre vi ved ham, som elskede os.
 38.  Thi jeg er vis på, at hverken Død eller Liv eller Engle eller
      Magter eller noget nærværende eller noget tilkommende eller
      Kræfter
 39.  eller det høje eller det dybe eller nogen anden Skabning skal
      kunne skille os fra Guds Kærlighed i Kristus Jesus, vor Herre.

Romerne 9

  1.  Sandhed siger jeg i Kristus, jeg lyver ikke, min Samvittighed
      vidner med mig i den Helligånd,
  2.  at jeg har en stor Sorg og en uafladelig Kummer i mit Hjerte.
  3.  Thi jeg kunde ønske selv at være bandlyst fra Kristus til Bedste
      for mine Brødre, mine Frænder efter Kødet,
  4.  de, som jo ere Israeliter, hvem Sønneudkårelsen og Herligheden
      og Pagterne og Lovgivningen og Gudstjenesten og Forjættelserne
      tilhøre,
  5.  hvem Fædrene tilhøre, og af hvem Kristus er efter Kødet, han,
      som er Gud over alle Ting, højlovet i Evighed! Amen.

  6.  Ikke dog som om Guds Ord har glippet; thi ikke alle, som stamme
      fra Israel, ere Israel;
  7.  ej, heller ere alle Børn, fordi de ere Abrahams Sæd, men: "I
      Isak skal en Sæd få Navn efter dig."
  8.  Det vil sige: Ikke Kødets Børn ere Guds Børn, men Forjættelsens
      Børn regnes for Sæd.
  9.  Thi et Forjættelsesord er dette: "Ved denne Tid vil jeg komme,
      så skal Sara have en Søn."
 10.  Men således skete det ikke alene dengang, men også med Rebekka,
      da hun var frugtsommelig ved een, Isak, vor Fader.
 11.  Thi da de endnu ikke vare fødte og ikke havde gjort noget godt
      eller ondt, blev der, for at Guds Udvælgelses Beslutning skulde
      stå fast, ikke i Kraft af Gerninger, men i Kraft af ham, der
      kalder,
 12.  sagt til hende: ""Den ældste skal tjene den yngste,""
 13.  som der er skrevet: ""Jakob elskede jeg, men Esau hadede jeg."

 14.  Hvad skulle vi da sige? mon der er Uretfærdighed hos Gud? Det
      være langt fra!
 15.  Thi han siger til Moses: "Jeg vil være barmhjertig imod den,
      hvem jeg er barmhjertig imod, og forbarme mig over den, hvem jeg
      forbarmer mig over."
 16.  Altså står det ikke til den, som vil, ej heller til den, som
      løber, men til Gud, som er barmhjertig.
 17.  Thi Skriften siger til Farao: "Netop derfor lod jeg dig fremstå,
      for at jeg kunde vise min Magt på dig, og for at mit Navn skulde
      forkyndes på hele Jorden."
 18.  Så forbarmer han sig da over den, som han vil, men forhærder
      den, som han vil.

 19.  Du vil nu sige til mig: Hvad klager han da over endnu? thi hvem
      står hans Villie imod?
 20.  Ja, men, hvem er dog du, o Menneske! som går i Rette med Gud?
      mon noget, som blev dannet, kan sige til den, som dannede det:
      Hvorfor gjorde du mig således?
 21.  Eller har Pottemageren ikke Rådighed over Leret til af den samme
      Masse at gøre et Kar til Ære, et andet til Vanære?
 22.  Men hvad om nu Gud, skønt han vilde vise sin Vrede og kundgøre
      sin Magt, dog med stor Langmodighed tålte Vredes-Kar, som vare
      beredte til Fortabelse,
 23.  også for at kundgøre sin Herligheds Rigdom over
      Barmhjertigheds-Kar, som han forud havde beredt til Herlighed?
 24.  Og hertil kaldte han også os, ikke alene af Jøder, men også af
      Hedninger,
 25.  som han også siger hos Hoseas: "Det, som ikke var mit Folk, vil
      jeg kalde mit Folk, og hende, som ikke var den elskede; den
      elskede;
 26.  og det skal ske, at på det Sted, hvor der blev sagt til dem: I
      ere ikke mit Folk, der skulle de kaldes den levende Guds Børn."
 27.  Men Esajas udråber over Israel: "Om end Israels Børns Tal var
      som Havets Sand, så skal kun Levningen frelses.
 28.  Thi idet Herren opgør Regnskab og afslutter det i Hast, vil han
      fuldbyrde det på Jorden."
 29.  Og som Esajas forud har sagt: "Dersom den Herre Zebaoth ikke
      havde levnet os en Sæd, da vare vi blevne som Sodoma og gjorte
      lige med Gomorra."

 30.  Hvad skulle vi da sige? At Hedninger, som ikke jagede efter
      Retfærdighed, fik Retfærdighed; nemlig Retfærdigheden af Tro;
 31.  men Israel, som jagede efter en Retfærdigheds Lov, nåede ikke
      til en sådan Lov.
 32.  Hvorfor? fordi de ikke søgte den af Tro, men som af Geringer. De
      stødte an på Anstødsstenen,
 33.  som der er skrevet: "Se, jeg sætter i Zion en Anstødssten og en
      Forargelses Klippe; og den, som tror på ham, skal ikke blive til
      Skamme."

Romerne 10

  1.  Brødre!mit Hjertes Ønske og Bøn til Gud for dem er om deres
      Frelse.
  2.  Thi jeg giver dem det Vidnesbyrd, at de have Nidkærhed for Gud,
      men ikke med Forstand;
  3.  thi da de ikke kendte Guds. Retfærdighed og tragtede efter at
      opstille deres egen Retfærdighed, så bøjede de sig ikke under
      Guds Retfærdighed.

  4.  Thi Kristus er Lovens Ende til Retfærdighed for hver den, som
      tror.
  5.  Moses skriver jo, at det Menneske, som gør den Retfærdighed, der
      er af Loven, skal leve ved den.
  6.  Men Retfærdigheden af Tro siger således: Sig ikke i dit Hjerte:
      Hvem vil fare op til Himmelen? nemlig for at hente Kristus ned;
  7.  eller: Hvem vil fare ned i Afgrunden? nemlig for at hente
      Kristus op fra de døde.
  8.  Men hvad,siger den? Ordet er dig nær, i din Mund og i dit
      Hjerte, det er det Troens Ord, som vi prædike.
  9.  Thi dersom du med din Mund bekender Jesus som Herre og tror i
      dit Hjerte, at Gud oprejste ham fra de døde, da skal du blive
      frelst.
 10.  Thi med Hjertet tror man til Retfærdighed, og med Munden
      bekender man til Frelse.
 11.  Skriften siger jo: "Hver den, som tror på ham, skal ikke blive
      til Skamme."
 12.  Thi der er ikke Forskel på Jøde og Græker; thi den samme er
      alles Herre, rig nok for alle dem, som påkalde ham.
 13.  Thi hver den, som påkalder Herrens Navn, skal blive frelst.

 14.  Hvorledes skulde de nu påkalde den, på hvem de ikke have troet?
      og hvorledes skulde de tro den, som de ikke have hørt? og
      hvorledes skulde de høre, uden der er nogen, som prædiker?
 15.  og hvorledes skulde de prædike, dersom de ikke bleve udsendte?
      Som der er skrevet: "Hvor dejlige. ere deres Fødder, som
      forkynde godt Budskab."
 16.  Dog ikke alle løde Evangeliet; thi Esajas siger: "Herre! hvem
      troede det, (han hørte af os?")
 17.  Altså kommer Troen af det. som høres, men det, som høres, kommer
      igennem Kristi Ord.
 18.  Men jeg siger: Have de ikke hørt? Jo vist, "over hele Jorden er
      deres Røst udgået og til Jorderiges Grænser deres Ord."
 19.  Men jeg siger: Har Israel ikke forstået det? Først siger Moses:
      "Jeg vil gøre eder nidkære på et Folk, som ikke er et Folk, imod
      et uforstandigt Folk vil jeg opirre eder."
 20.  Men Esajas drister sig til at sige: "Jeg blev funden af dem, som
      ikke søgte mig; jeg blev åbenbar for dem. som ikke spurgte efter
      mig."
 21.  Men om Israel siger han: "Den hele Dag udstrakte jeg mine Hænder
      imod et ulydigt og genstridigt Folk."

Romerne 11

  1.  Jeg siger da: Mon Gud har forskudt sit folk? det være langt fra!
      Thi også jeg er en Israelit, af "Abrahams Sæd, Benjamins Stamme.
  2.  Gud har ikke forskudt sit Folk, som han forud kendte. Eller vide
      I ikke, hvad Skriften siger i Stykket om Elias? hvorledes han
      træder frem for Gud imod Israel, sigende:
  3.  "Herre! dine Profeter have de ihjelslået, dine Altre have de
      nedbrudt, og jeg er den eneste, der er levnet, og de efterstræbe
      mit Liv."
  4.  Men hvad siger det guddommelige Gensvar til ham?"Jeg har levnet
      mig selv syv Tusinde Mænd, som ikke have bøjet Knæ for Bål."
  5.  Således er der også i den nærværende Tid blevet en Levning som
      et Nådes-Udvalg.
  6.  Men er det af Nåde, da er det ikke mere af Gerninger, ellers
      bliver Nåden ikke mere Nåde.
  7.  Hvad altså? Det, Israel søger efter, har det ikke opnået, men
      Udvalget har opnået det; de øvrige derimod bleve forhærdede,
  8.  som der er skrevet: "Gud gav dem en Sløvheds Ånd, Øjne til ikke
      at se med, Øren til ikke at høre med indtil den Dag i Dag."
  9.  Og David siger: "Deres Bord vorde til Snare og til Fælde og til
      Anstød og til Gengældelse for dem;
 10.  deres Øjne vorde formørkede, så de ikke se, og bøj altid deres
      Ryg!"

 11.  Jeg siger da: Mon de have stødt an, for at de skulde falde? Det
      være langt fra! Men ved deres Fald er Frelsen kommen til
      Hedningerne, for at dette kunde vække dem til Nidkærhed.
 12.  Men dersom deres Fald er Verdens Rigdom, og deres Tab er
      Hedningers Rigdom, hvor meget mere skal deres Fylde være det!
 13.  Og til eder, I Hedninger, siger jeg: For så vidt jeg nu er
      Hedningeapostel, ærer jeg min Tjeneste,
 14.  om jeg dog kunde vække min Slægt til Nidkærhed og frelse nogle
      af dem.
 15.  Thi dersom deres Forkastelse er Verdens Forligelse, hvad bliver
      da deres Antagelse andet end Liv ud af døde?

 16.  Men dersom Førstegrøden er hellig, da er Dejgen det også; og
      dersom Roden er hellig, da ere Grenene det også.
 17.  Men om nogle af Grenene bleve afbrudte, og du, en vild
      Oliekvist, blev indpodet iblandt dem og blev meddelagtig i
      Olietræets Rod og Fedme,
 18.  da ros dig ikke imod Grenene; men dersom du roser dig, da bærer
      jo ikke du Roden, men Roden dig.
 19.  Du vil vel sige: Grene bleve afbrudte, for at jeg skulde blive
      indpodet.
 20.  Vel! ved deres Vantro bleve de afbrudte, men du står ved din
      Tro; vær ikke overmodig, men frygt!
 21.  Thi når Gud ikke sparede de naturlige Grene, vil han heller ikke
      spare dig.
 22.  Så se da Guds Godhed og Strenghed: Over dem, som faldt, er der
      Strenghed, men over dig Guds Godhed, hvis du bliver i hans
      Godhed; ellers skal også du afhugges.
 23.  Men også hine skulle indpodes, dersom de ikke blive i Vantroen;
      thi Gud er mægtig til atter at indpode dem.
 24.  Thi når du blev afhugget af det Olietræ, som er vildt af
      Naturen, og imod Naturen blev indpodet i et ædelt Olietræ, hvor
      meget mere skulle da disse indpodes i deres eget Olietræ, som de
      af Natur tilhøre!

 25.  Thi jeg vil ikke, Brødre! at I skulle være uvidende om denne
      Hemmelighed, for at I ikke skulle være kloge i eders egne
      Tanker, at Forhærdelse delvis er kommen over Israel, indtil
      Hedningernes Fylde er gået ind;
 26.  og så skal hele Israel frelses, som der er skrevet: "Fra Zion
      skal Befrieren komme, han skal afvende Ugudeligheder fra Jakob;
 27.  og dette er min Pagt med dem, når jeg borttager deres Synder."
 28.  Efter Evangeliet er de vel Fjender for eders Skyld, men efter
      Udvælgelsen ere de elskede for Fædrenes Skyld;
 29.  thi Nådegaverne og sit Kald fortryder Gud ikke.
 30.  Thi ligesom I tilforn bleve ulydige imod Gud, men nu fik
      Barmhjertighed ved disses Ulydighed,
 31.  således bleve også disse nu ulydige, for at også de måtte få
      Barmhjertighed ved den Barmhjertighed, som er bleven eder til
      Del.
 32.  Thi Gud har indesluttet alle under Ulydighed, for at han kunde
      forbarme sig over alle.
 33.  O Dyb af Guds Rigdom og Visdom og Kundskab! hvor uransagelige
      ere hans Domme, og hans Veje usporlige!
 34.  Thi hvem har kendt Herrens Sind? eller hvem blev hans Rådgiver?
 35.  eller hvem gav ham først, så at der skulde gives ham Gengæld
      derfor?
 36.  Thi af ham og ved ham og til ham ere alle Ting; ham være Ære i
      Evighed! Amen.

Romerne 12

  1.  Jeg formaner eder altså, Brødre! ved Guds Barmhjertighed, til at
      fremstille eder Legemer som et levende, helligt, Gud
      velbehageligt Offer; dette er eders fornuftige Gudsdyrkelse.
  2.  Og skikker eder ikke lige med denne Verden, men vorder
      forvandlede ved Sindets Fornyelse, så I må skønne, hvad der er
      Guds Villie, det gode og velbehagelige og fuldkomne.

  3.  Thi ved den Nåde, som er given mig, siger jeg til enhver iblandt
      eder, at han ikke skal tænke højere om sig selv, end han bør
      tænke, men tænke med Betænksomhed, efter som Gud tildelte enhver
      Troens Mål.
  4.  Thi ligesom vi have mange Lemmer på eet Legeme, men Lemmerne
      ikke alle have den samme Gerning,
  5.  således ere vi mange eet Legeme i Kristus, men hver for sig
      hverandres Lemmer.
  6.  Men efterdi vi have forskellige Nådegaver efter den Nåde, som er
      given os, det være sig Profeti, da lader os bruge den i Forhold
      til vor Tro;
  7.  eller en Tjeneste, da lader os tage Vare på Tjenesten; eller om
      nogen lærer, på Lærergerningen;
  8.  eller om nogen formaner, på Formaningen; den, som uddeler, gøre
      det med Redelighed; den, som er Forstander, være det med Iver;
      den, som øver Barmhjertighed, gøre det med Glæde!

  9.  Kærligheden være uskrømtet; afskyer det onde, holder eder til
      det gode;
 10.  værer i eders Broderkærlighed hverandre inderligt hengivne;
      forekommer hverandre i at vise Ærbødighed!
 11.  Værer ikke lunkne i eders Iver; værer brændende i Ånden; tjener
      Herren;
 12.  værer glade i Håbet, udholdende i Trængselen, vedholdende i
      Bønnen!
 13.  Tager Del i de helliges Fornødenheder; lægger Vind på
      Gæstfrihed!
 14.  Velsigner dem, som forfølge eder, velsigner og forbander ikke!
 15.  Glæder eder med de glade, og græder med de grædende!
 16.  Værer enige indbyrdes; tragter ikke efter de høje Ting, men
      holder eder til det lave; vorder ikke kloge i eders egne Tanker!
 17.  Betaler ikke nogen ondt for ondt; lægger Vind på, hvad der er
      godt for alle Menneskers Åsyn!
 18.  Dersom det er muligt - såvidt det står til eder - da holder Fred
      med alle Mennesker:
 19.  Hævner eder ikke selv, I elskede! men giver Vreden Rum; thi der
      er skrevet: "Mig hører Hævnen til, jeg vil betale, siger
      Herren."
 20.  Nej, dersom din Fjende hungrer, giv ham Mad; dersom han tørster,
      giv ham Drikke; thi når du gør dette, vil du samle gloende Kul
      på hans Hoved.
 21.  Lad dig ikke overvinde af det onde, men overvind det onde med
      det gode!

Romerne 13

  1.  Hver Sjæl underordne sig de foresatte Øvrigheder; thi der er
      ikke Øvrighed uden af Gud, men de, som ere, ere indsatte af Gud,
  2.  så at den, som sætter sig imod Øvrigheden, modstår Guds Ordning;
      men de, som modstå, skulle få deres Dom.
  3.  Thi de styrende ere ikke en Skræk for den gode Gerning, men for
      den onde. Men vil du være uden Frygt for Øvrigheden, så gør det
      gode, og du skal få Ros af den.
  4.  Thi den er en Guds Tjener, dig til gode. Men dersom du gør det
      onde, da frygt; thi den bærer ikke Sværdet forgæves; den er
      nemlig Guds Tjener, en Hævner til Straf for den, som øver det
      onde.
  5.  Derfor er det nødvendigt at underordne sig, ikke alene for
      Straffens Skyld, men også for Samvittighedens.
  6.  Derfor betale I jo også Skatter; thi de ere Guds Tjenere, som
      just tage Vare på dette.
  7.  Betaler alle, hvad I ere dem skyldige: den, som I ere Skat
      skyldige, Skat; den, som Told, Told; den, som Frygt, Frygt; den,
      som Ære, Ære.

  8.  Bliver ingen noget skyldige, uden det, at elske hverandre; thi
      den, som elsker den anden, har opfyldt Loven.
  9.  Thi det: "Du må ikke bedrive Hor; du må ikke slå ihjel; du må
      ikke stjæle; du må ikke begære," og hvilket andet bud der er,
      det sammenfattes i dette Ord: "Du skal elske din Næste som dig
      selv,"
 10.  Kærligheden gør ikke ondt imod Næsten; derfor er Kærligheden
      Lovens Fylde.

 11.  Og dette just, fordi I kende Tiden, at det alt er på Tide, at I
      skulle stå op af Søvne; thi nu er vor Frelse nærmere, end da vi
      bleve troende.
 12.  Natten er fremrykket, og Dagen er kommen nær. Lader os derfor
      aflægge Mørkets Gerninger og iføre os Lysets Våben;
 13.  lader os vandre sømmeligt som om Dagen, ikke i Svir og Drik,
      ikke i Løsagtighed og Uterlighed, ikke i Kiv og Avind;
 14.  men ifører eder den Herre Jesus Kristus, og drager ikke Omsorg
      for Kødet, så Begæringer vækkes!

Romerne 14

  1.  Men tager eder af den, som er skrøbelig i Troen, og dømmer ikke
      hans Meninger!
  2.  En har Tro til at spise alt; men den skrøbelige spiser kun
      Urter.
  3.  Den, som spiser, må ikke ringeagte den, som ikke spiser; og den,
      som ikke spiser, må ikke dømme den, som spiser; thi Gud har
      taget sig af ham.
  4.  Hvem er du, som dømmer en andens Tjener? For sin egen Herre står
      eller falder han; men han skal blive stående, thi Herren er
      mægtig til at lade ham stå.
  5.  En agter den ene Dag fremfor den anden, en anden agter alle dage
      lige; enhver have fuld Vished i sit eget Sind!
  6.  Den, som lægger Vægt på Dagen, han gør det for Herren. Og den,
      som spiser, gør det for Herren, thi han takker Gud; og den, som
      ikke spiser, gør det for Herren og takker Gud.
  7.  Thi ingen af os lever for sig selv, og ingen dør for sig selv;
  8.  thi når vi leve, leve vi for Herren, og når vi dø, dø vi for
      Herren; derfor, enten vi leve, eller vi dø, ere vi Herrens.
  9.  Dertil er jo Kristus død og bleven levende, at han skal herske
      både over døde og levende.
 10.  Men du, hvorfor dømmer du din Broder? eller du, hvorfor
      ringeagter du din Broder? Vi skulle jo alle fremstilles for Guds
      Domstol.
 11.  Thi der er skrevet: "Så sandt jeg lever, siger Herren, for mig
      skal hvert Knæ bøje sig, og hver Tunge skal bekende Gud."
 12.  Altså skal hver af os gøre Gud Regnskab for sig selv.

 13.  Derfor,lader os ikke mere dømme hverandre, men dømmer hellere
      dette, at man ikke må give sin Broder Anstød eller Forargelse.
 14.  Jeg ved og er vis på i den Herre Jesus, at intet er urent i sig
      selv; dog, for den, som agter noget for urent, for ham er det
      urent.
 15.  Thi dersom din Broder bedrøves for Mads Skyld, da vandrer du
      ikke mere i Kærlighed. Led ikke ved din Mad den i Fordærvelse,
      for hvis Skyld Kristus er død.
 16.  Lader derfor ikke eders Gode blive bespottet!
 17.  Thi Guds Rige består ikke i at spise og drikke, men i
      Retfærdighed og Fred og Glæde i den Helligånd.
 18.  Thi den, som deri tjener Kristus, er velbehagelig for Gud og
      tækkelig for Menneskene.
 19.  Derfor, lader os tragte efter det, som tjener til Fred og
      indbyrdes Opbyggelse!
 20.  Nedbryd ikke Guds Værk for Mads Skyld! Vel er alt rent, men det
      er ondt for det Menneske, som spiser med Anstød.
 21.  Det er rigtigt ikke at spise Kød eller at drikke Vin eller at
      gøre noget, hvoraf din Broder tager Anstød.
 22.  Den Tro, du har, hav den hos dig selv for Gud! Salig er den, som
      ikke dømmer sig selv i det, som han vælger.
 23.  Men den, som tvivler, når han spiser, han er domfældt, fordi det
      ikke er at Tro; men alt det, som ikke er af Tro, er Synd.

Romerne 15

  1.  Men vi, som ere stærke, bør bære de svages Skrøbeligheder og
      ikke være os selv til Behag.
  2.  Enhver af os være sin Næste til Behag til det gode, til
      Opbyggelse.
  3.  Thi også Kristus var ikke sig selv til Behag; men, som der er
      skrevet: "Deres Forhånelser, som håne dig, ere faldne på mig."
  4.  Thi alt, hvad der er skrevet tilforn, det er skrevet til vor
      Belæring, for at vi skulle have Håbet ved Udholdenheden og
      Skrifternes Trøst.
  5.  Men Udholdenhedensog Trøstens Gud give eder at være enige
      indbyrdes, som Kristus Jesus vil det,
  6.  for at I endrægtigt med een Mund kunne prise Gud og vor Herres
      Jesu Kristi Fader.
  7.  Derfor tager eder af hverandre, ligesom også Kristus har taget
      sig af os, til Guds Ære.
  8.  Jeg siger nemlig, at Kristus er bleven Tjener for omskårne for
      Guds Sanddruheds Skyld for at stadfæste Forjættelserne til
      Fædrene;
  9.  men at Hedningerne skulle prise Gud for hans Barmhjertigheds
      Skyld, som der er skrevet: "Derfor vil jeg bekende dig iblandt
      Hedninger og lovsynge dit Navn,"
 10.  Og atter siges der: "Fryder eder, I Hedninger, med hans Folk!"
 11.  Og atter: "Lover Herren, alle Hedninger, og alle Folkene skulle
      prise ham."
 12.  Og atter siger Esajas: "Komme skal Isajs Rodskud og han, der
      rejser sig for at herske over Hedninger; på ham skulle Hedninger
      håbe."
 13.  Men Håbets Gud fylde eder med al Glæde og Fred, idet I tro, for
      at I må blive rige i Håbet ved den Helligånds Kraft!

 14.  Men også jeg, mine Brødre! har selv den Forvisning om eder, at I
      også selv ere fulde af Godhed, fyldte med al Kundskab, i Stand
      til også at påminde hverandre.
 15.  Dog har jeg for en Del tilskrevet eder noget dristigere for at
      påminde eder på Grund af den Nåde, som er given mig fra Gud
 16.  til iblandt Hedningerne at være en Kristi Jesu Offertjener, der
      som Præst betjener Guds Evangelium, for at Hedningerne må blive
      et velbehageligt Offer, helliget ved den Helligånd.
 17.  Således har jeg min Ros i Kristus Jesus af min Tjeneste for Gud.
 18.  Thi jeg vil ikke driste mig til at tale om noget af det, som
      Kristus ikke har udført ved mig til at virke Hedningers
      Lydighed, ved Ord og Handling,
 19.  ved Tegns og Undergerningers Kraft, ved Guds Ånds Kraft, så at
      jeg fra Jerusalem og trindt omkring indtil Illyrien har til
      fulde forkyndt Kristi Evangelium;
 20.  dog således, at jeg sætter min Ære i at forkynde Evangeliet ikke
      der, hvor Kristus er nævnet, for at jeg,ikke skal bygge på en
      andens Grundvold,
 21.  men, som der er skrevet: "De, for hvem der ikke blev kundgjort
      om ham, skulle se, og de, som ikke have hørt, skulle forstå."

 22.  Derfor er jeg også de mange Gange bleven forhindret i at komme
      til eder.
 23.  Men nu, da jeg ikke mere har Rum i disse Egne og i mange År har
      haft Længsel efter at komme til eder,
 24.  vil jeg, når jeg rejser til Spanien, komme til eder; thi jeg
      håber at se eder på Gennemrejsen og af eder at blive befordret
      derhen, når jeg først i nogen Måde er bleven tilfredsstillet hos
      eder.
 25.  Men nu rejser jeg til Jerusalem i Tjeneste for de hellige.
 26.  Thi Makedonien og Akaja have fundet Glæde i at gøre et
      Sammenskud til de fattige iblandt de hellige i Jerusalem.
 27.  De have nemlig fundet Glæde deri, og de ere deres Skyldnere. Thi
      ere Hedningerne blevne delagtige i hines åndelige Goder, da ere
      de også skyldige at tjene dem med de timelige.
 28.  Når jeg da har fuldbragt dette og beseglet denne Frugt for dem,
      vil jeg derfra drage om ad eder til Spanien.
 29.  Men jeg ved, at når jeg kommer til eder, skal jeg komme med
      Kristi Velsignelses Fylde.

 30.  Men jeg formaner eder,Brødre! ved vor Herre Jesus Kristus og ved
      Åndens Kærlighed til med mig at stride i eders Bønner for mig
      til Gud,
 31.  for at jeg må udfries fra de genstridige i Judæa, og mit Ærinde
      til Jerusalem må blive de hellige kærkomment,
 32.  for at jeg kan komme til eder med Glæde, ved Guds Villie, og
      vederkvæges med eder.
 33.  Men Fredens Gud være med eder alle! Amen.

Romerne 16

  1.  Men jeg anbefaler eder Føbe, vor Søster, som er Tjenerinde ved
      Menighed i Kenkreæ,
  2.  for at I må modtage hende i Herren, som det sømmer sig de
      hellige, og yde hende Bistand, i hvad som helst hun måtte trænge
      til eder; thi også hun har været en Hjælperske for mange og for
      mig selv med.
  3.  Hilser Priska og Akvila, mine Medarbejdere i Kristus Jesus,
  4.  som jo for mit Liv have sat deres egen Hals i Vove, hvem ikke
      alene jeg takker, men også alle Hedningernes Menigheder;
  5.  og hilser Menigheden i deres Hus! Hilser Epænetus, min elskede,
      som er Asiens Førstegrøde for Kristus.
  6.  Hilser Maria, som har arbejdet meget for eder.
  7.  Hilser Andronikus og Junias, mine Frænder og mine medfangne, som
      jo ere navnkundige iblandt Apostlene og tilmed have været i
      Kristus før mig.
  8.  Hilser Ampliatus, min elskede i Herren!
  9.  Hilser Urbanus, vor Medarbejder i Kristus, og Stakys, min
      elskede!
 10.  Hilser Apelles, den prøvede i Kristus. Hilser dem, som ere af
      Aristobulus's Hus.
 11.  Hilser Herodion, min Frænde! Hilser dem af Narkissus's Hus, som
      ere i Herren.
 12.  Hilser Tryfæna og Tryfosa, som arbejde i Herren. Hilser; Persis,
      den elskede, som jo har arbejdet meget i Herren.
 13.  Hilser Rufus, den udvalgte i Herren, og hans og min Moder!
 14.  Hilser Asynkritus,Flegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas og Brødrene
      hos dem!
 15.  Hilser Filologus og Julia, Nereus og hans Søster og Olympas og
      alle de hellige hos dem!
 16.  Hilser hverandre med et helligt Kys! Alle Kristi Menigheder
      hilse eder!

 17.  Men jeg formaner eder, Brødre! til at give Agt på dem, som volde
      Splittelseme og Forargelseme tvært imod den Lære, som I have
      lært, og viger bort fra dem!
 18.  Thi sådanne tjene ikke vor Herre Kristus, men deres egen Bug, og
      ved søde Ord og skøn Tale forføre de troskyldiges Hjerter.
 19.  Eders Lydighed er jo kommen alle for Øre; derfor glæder jeg mig
      over eder. Men jeg vil, at I skulle være vise med Hensyn til det
      gode og enfoldige med Hensyn til det onde.
 20.  Men Fredens Gud skal hastelig knuse Satan under eders
      Fødder. Vore Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde være med eder!

 21.  Timotheus, min Medarbejder, og Lukius og Jason og Sosipater,
      mine Frænder, hilse eder.
 22.  Jeg,Tertius, som har nedskrevet dette Brev, hilser eder i
      Herren.
 23.  Kajus, min og den hele Menigheds Vært, hilser eder. Erastus,
      Stadens Rentemester, hilser eder, og Broderen Kvartus.

 24.  Vor Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde være med eder alle! Amen.)
 25.  Men ham, som kan styrke eder i mit Evangelium og Forkyndelsen af
      Jesus Kristus, i Overensstemmelse med Åbenbarelse af en
      Hemmelighed, som var fortiet fra evige Tider,
 26.  men nu er bragt for Dagen og ved profetiske Skrifter efter den
      evige Guds Befaling kundgjort for alle Hedningerne til
      TrosLydighed:
 27.  Den ene vise Gud ved Jesus Kristus, ham være Ære i Evigheders
      Evighed! Amen.


1.Korinterne

1.Korinterne 1

  1.  Paulus, Jesu Kristi kaldede Apostel ved Guds Villie, og Broderen
      Sosthenes
  2.  til Guds Menighed, som er i Korinth, helligede i Kristus Jesus,
      hellige ifølge Kald tillige med alle dem, der på ethvert Sted
      påkalde vor Herres Jesu Kristi, deres og vor Herres Navn:
  3.  Nåde være med eder og Fred fra Gud vor Fader og den Herre Jesus
      Kristus!

  4.  Jeg takker min Gud altid for eder, for den Guds Nåde, som blev
      givet eder i Kristus Jesus,
  5.  at I ved ham ere blevne rige i alt, i al Tale og al Kundskab,
  6.  ligesom Vidnesbyrdet om Kristus er blevet stadfæstet hos eder,
  7.  så at I ikke stå tilbage i nogen Nådegave, idet I forvente vor
      Herres Jesu Kristi Åbenbarelse,
  8.  han, som også skal stadfæste eder indtil Enden som ustraffelige
      på vor Herres Jesu Kristi Dag,
  9.  Trofast er Gud, ved hvem I bleve kaldede til Samfund med hans
      Søn, Jesus Kristus, vor Herre.

 10.  Men jeg formaner eder, Brødre! ved vor Herres Jesu Kristi Navn,
      at I alle skulle føre samme Tale, og at der ikke må findes
      Splittelser iblandt eder, men at I skulle være forenede i det
      samme Sind og i den samme Mening.
 11.  Thi det er blevet mig fortalt om eder, mine Brødre! af Bloes
      Husfolk, at der er Splidagtighed iblandt eder.
 12.  Jeg mener dette, at enhver af eder siger: Jeg hører Paulus til,
      og jeg Apollos, og jeg Kefas, og jeg Kristus.
 13.  Er Kristus delt? mon Paulus blev korsfæstet for eder? eller
      bleve I døbte til Paulus's Navn?
 14.  Jeg takker Gud for, at jeg ikke døbte nogen af eder, uden
      Krispus og Kajus,
 15.  for at ikke nogen skal sige, at I bleve døbte til mit Navn.
 16.  Dog, jeg døbte også Stefanas's Hus; ellers ved jeg ikke, om jeg
      døbte nogen anden.

 17.  Thi Kristus sendte mig ikke for at døbe, men for at forkynde
      Evangeliet, ikke med vise Ord, for at Kristi Kors ikke skulde
      tabe sin Kraft.
 18.  Thi Korsets Ord er vel for dem, som fortabes, en Dårskab, men
      for dem, som frelses, for os er det en Guds Kraft.
 19.  Thi der er skrevet: "Jeg vil lægge de vises Visdom øde, og de
      forstandiges Forstand vil jeg gøre til intet."
 20.  Hvor er der en viis? hvor er der en skriftklog? hvor er der en
      Ordkæmper al denne verden? har Gud ikke gjort Verdens Visdom til
      Dårskab?
 21.  Thi efterdi Verden ved sin Visdom ikke erkendte Gud i hans
      Visdom, behagede det Gud ved Prædikenens Dårskab at frelse dem,
      som tro,
 22.  eftersom både Jøder kræve Tegn, og Grækere søge Visdom,
 23.  vi derimod prædike Kristus som korsfæstet, for Jøder en
      Forargelse og for Hedninger en Dårskab,
 24.  men for selve de kaldede både Jøder og Grækere, Kristus som Guds
      Kraft og Guds Visdom.
 25.  Thi Guds Dårskab er visere end Menneskene, og Guds Svaghed er
      stærkere end Menneskene.

 26.  Thi ser, Brødre! på eders Kaldelse, at I ere ikke mange vise
      efter Kødet, ikke mange mægtige, ikke mange fornemme;
 27.  men det, som var Dårskab for Verden udvalgte Gud for at beskæmme
      de vise, og det, som var svagt for Verden, udvalgte Gud for at
      beskæmme det stærke;
 28.  og det for Verden uædle og det ringeagtede, det, som intet var,
      udvalgte Gud for at gøre det, som var noget, til intet,
 29.  for at intet Kød skal rose sig for Gud.
 30.  Men ud af ham ere I i Kristus Jesus, som blev os Visdom fra Gud,
      både Retfærdighed og Helliggørelse og Forløsning;
 31.  for at, som der er skrevet: "Den, som roser sig, rose sig af
      Herren!"

1.Korinterne 2

  1.  Og jeg, Brødre! da jeg kom til eder, kom jeg ikke og forkyndte
      eder Gud Vidnesbyrd med Stormægtighed i Tale eller i Visdom;
  2.  thi jeg agtede ikke at vide noget iblandt eder uden Jesus
      Kristus og ham korsfæstet;
  3.  og jeg færdedes hos eder i Svaghed og i Frygt og megen Bæven,
  4.  og min Tale og min Prædiken var ikke med Visdoms overtalende
      Ord, men med Ånds og Krafts Bevisning,
  5.  for at eders Tro ikke skulde bero på Menneskers Visdom, men på
      Guds Kraft.

  6.  Dog, Visdom tale vi iblandt de fuldkomne, men en Visdom, der
      ikke stammer fra denne Verden, ikke heller fra denne Verdens
      Herskere, som blive til intet;
  7.  men vi tale Visdom fra Gud, den hemmelige, den, som var skjult,
      som Gud før Verdens Begyndelse forudbestemte til vor Herlighed,
  8.  hvilken ingen af denne Verdens Herskere har erkendt; thi; havde
      de erkendt den,havde de ikke korsfæstet Herlighedens Herre;
  9.  men, som der er skrevet: "Hvad intet Øje har set, og intet Øre
      har hørt, og ikke er opkommet i noget Menneskes Hjerte, hvad Gud
      har beredt dem, som elske ham."
 10.  Men os åbenbarede Gud det ved Ånden; thi Ånden ransager alle
      Ting, også Guds Dybder.
 11.  Thi hvilket Menneske ved, hvad der er i Mennesket, uden
      Menneskets Ånd, som er i ham? Således har heller ingen erkendt,
      hvad der er i Gud, uden Guds Ånd.
 12.  Men vi have ikke fået Verdens Ånd, men Ånden fra Gud, for at vi
      kunne vide, hvad der er os skænket af Gud;
 13.  og dette tale vi også, ikke med Ord, lærte af menneskelig
      Visdom, men med Ord, lærte af Ånden, idet vi tolke åndelige Ting
      med åndelige Ord.

 14.  Men det sjælelige Menneske tager ikke imod de Ting, som høre
      Guds Ånd til; thi de ere ham en Dårskab, og han kan ikke erkende
      dem, thi de bedømmes åndeligt.
 15.  Men den åndelige bedømmer alle Ting, selv derimod bedømmes han
      af ingen.
 16.  Thi hvem har kendt Herrens Sind, så han skulde kunne undervise
      ham? Men vi have Kristi Sind.

1.Korinterne 3

  1.  Og jeg, Brødre! kunde ikke tale til eder som til åndelige, men
      som til kødelige, som til spæde Børn i Kristus.
  2.  Mælk gav jeg eder at drikke, ikke fast Føde; thi I kunde endnu
      ikke tåle det, ja, I kunne det ikke engang nu;
  3.  thi endnu ere I kødelige. Når der nemlig er Nid og Splid iblandt
      eder, ere I da ikke kødelige og vandre på Menneskers Vis?
  4.  Thi når en siger: "Jeg hører Paulus til," og en anden: "Jeg
      hører Apollos til," ere I så ikke "Mennesker"?

  5.  Hvad er da Apollos? og hvad er Paulus? Tjenere, ved hvilke I
      bleve troende og det, efter som Herren gav enhver.
  6.  Jeg plantede, Apollos vandede, men Gud gav Vækst.
  7.  Så er da hverken den noget, som planter, ikke heller den, som
      vander, men Gud, som giver Vækst.
  8.  Den, som planter, og den, som vander, ere eet; men hver skal få
      sin egen Løn efter sit eget Arbejde.
  9.  Thi Guds Medarbejdere ere vi; Guds Ager, Guds Bygning ere I.

 10.  Efter den Guds Nåde, som blev given mig, har jeg som en viis
      Bygmester lagt Grundvold, men en anden bygger derpå. Men enhver
      se til, hvorledes han bygger derpå!
 11.  thi anden Grundvold kan ingen lægge end den, som er lagt,
      hvilken er Jesus Kristus.
 12.  Men dersom nogen på Grundvolden bygger med Guld, Sølv, kostbare
      Sten, Træ, Hø, Strå,
 13.  da skal enhvers Arbejde blive åbenbaret; thi Dagen skal gøre det
      klart, efterdi den åbenbares med Ild, og hvordan enhvers Arbejde
      er, det skal Ilden prøve.
 14.  Dersom det Arbejde, som en har bygget derpå, består, da skal han
      få Løn;
 15.  dersom ens Arbejde bliver opbrændt, da skal han gå Glip af den;
      men selv skal han blive frelst, dog som igennem Ild.
 16.  Vide I ikke, at I ere Guds Tempel, og Guds Ånd bor i eder?
 17.  Dersom nogen fordærver Guds Tempel, skal Gud fordærve ham; thi
      Guds Tempel er helligt, og det ere jo I.

 18.  Ingen bedrage sig selv! Dersom nogen tykkes at være viis iblandt
      eder i denne Verden, han vorde en Dåre, for at han kan vorde
      viis.
 19.  Thi denne Verdens Visdom er Dårskab for Gud; thi der er skrevet:
      "Han er den, som griber de vise i deres Træskhed;"
 20.  og atter:"Herren kender de vises Tanker, at de ere
      forfængelige."
 21.  Derfor rose ingen sig af Mennesker! Alle Ting ere jo eders,
 22.  være sig Paulus eller Apollos eller Kefas eller Verden eller Liv
      eller Død eller det nærværende eller det tilkommende: alle Ting
      ere eders;
 23.  men I ere Kristi, og Kristus er Guds.

1.Korinterne 4

  1.  Således agte man os; som Kristi Tjenere og Husholdere over Guds
      Hemmeligheder!
  2.  I øvrigt kræves her af Husholdere, at man må findes tro,
  3.  Men mig er det såre lidet at bedømmes af eder eller af en
      menneskelig Ret; ja, jeg bedømmer end ikke mig selv.
  4.  Thi vel ved jeg intet med mig selv, dog er jeg ikke dermed
      retfærdiggjort; men den, som bedømmer mig, er Herren.
  5.  Derfor dømmer ikke noget før Tiden, førend Herren kommer, som
      både skal bringe for lyset det, som er skjult i Mørket, og
      åbenbare Hjerternes Råd; og da skal enhver få sin Ros fra Gud.

  6.  Men dette, Brødre! har jeg anvendt på mig selv og Apollos for
      eders Skyld, for at I på os kunne lære dette "ikke ud over, hvad
      der står skrevet", for at ikke nogen af eder for eens Skyld skal
      opblæse sig mod en anden.
  7.  Thi hvem giver dig Fortrin? og hvad har du, som du ikke har fået
      givet? men når du virkelig har fået det, hvorfor roser du dig
      da, som om du ikke havde fået det?
  8.  I ere allerede mættede, I ere allerede blevne rige, I ere blevne
      Konger uden os, ja, gid I dog vare blevne Konger, for at også vi
      kunde være Konger med eder!
  9.  Thi mig synes, at Gud har fremstillet os Apostle som de
      ringeste, ligesom dødsdømte; thi et Skuespilere vi blevne for
      Verden, både for Engle og Mennesker.
 10.  Vi ere Dårer for Kristi Skyld, men I ere kloge i Kristus; vi
      svage, men I stærke; I hædrede, men vi vanærede.
 11.  Indtil denne Time lide vi både Hunger og Tørst og Nøgenhed og få
      Næveslag og have intet blivende Sted
 12.  og arbejde møjsommeligt med vore egne Hænder. Udskælder man os,
      velsigne vi; forfølger man os, finde vi os deri;
 13.  spotter man os, give vi gode Ord; som Verdens Fejeskarn ere vi
      blevne, et Udskud for alle indtil nu.

 14.  Ikke for at beskæmme eder skriver jeg dette; men jeg påminder
      eder som mine elskede Børn.
 15.  Thi om I end have ti Tusinde Opdragere i Kristus, have I dog
      ikke mange Fædre; thi jeg har i Kristus Jesus avlet eder ved
      Evangeliet.
 16.  Jeg formaner eder altså, vorder mine Efterfølgere!
 17.  Derfor har jeg sendt Timotheus til eder, som er mit elskede og
      trofaste Barn i Herren, og han skal minde eder om mine Veje i
      Kristus, således som jeg lærer alle Vegne i enhver Menighed.
 18.  Men nogle ere blevne opblæste, i den Tanke, at jeg ikke kommer
      til eder;
 19.  men jeg skal snart komme til eder, om Herren vil, og gøre mig
      bekendt, ikke med de opblæstes Ord, men med deres Kraft.
 20.  Thi Guds Rige består ikke i Ord, men i Kraft.
 21.  Hvad ville I? Skal jeg komme til eder med Ris eller med
      Kærlighed og Sagtmodigheds Ånd?

1.Korinterne 5

  1.  I det hele taget høres der om Utugt iblandt eder, og det sådan
      Utugt, som end ikke findes iblandt Hedningerne, at en lever med
      sin Faders Hustru.
  2.  Og I ere opblæste og bleve ikke snarere bedrøvede, for at den,
      som har gjort denne Gerning, måtte udstødes af eders Midte!
  3.  Thi jeg for min Del, fraværende med Legemet, men nærværende med
      Ånden, har allerede, som om jeg var nærværende, fældet den Dom
      over ham, som på sådan, Vis har bedrevet dette,
  4.  at, når i vor Herres Jesu Navn I og min Ånd ere forsamlede, så
      med vor Herres Jesu Kraft
  5.  at overgive den pågældende til Satan til Kødets Undergang, for
      af Ånden kan frelses på den Herres Jesu dag.
  6.  Det er ikke noget smukt, I rose eder af! Vide I ikke, at en
      liden Surdejg syrer hele Dejgen?
  7.  Udrenser den gamle Surdejg, for at I kunne være en ny Dejg,
      ligesom I jo ere usyrede;thi også vort Påskelam er slagtet,
      nemlig Kristus.
  8.  Derfor, lader os holde Højtid, ikke med gammel Surdejg, ej
      heller med Sletheds og Ondskabs Surdejg, men med Renheds og
      Sandheds usyrede Brød.

  9.  Jeg skrev eder til i mit Brev, at I ikke skulle have Samkvem med
      utugtige,
 10.  ikke i al Almindelighed denne Verdens utugtige eller havesyge og
      Røvere eller Afgudsdyrkere; ellers måtte I jo gå ud af Verden.
 11.  Men nu skrev jeg til eder, at I ikke skulle have Samkvem, om
      nogen, der har Navn af Broder, er en utugtig eller en havesyg
      eller en Afgudsdyrker eller en Skændegæst eller en Dranker eller
      en Røver, ja, end ikke spise sammen med en sådan.
 12.  Thi hvad kommer det mig ved at dømme dem, som ere udenfor? Dømme
      I ikke dem, som ere indenfor?
 13.  Men dem udenfor skal Gud dømme.Bortskaffer den onde fra eder
      selv!

1.Korinterne 6

  1.  Kan nogen af eder, når han har Sag med en anden, føre det over
      sit Sind at søge Dom hos de uretfærdige, og ikke hos de hellige?
  2.  Eller vide I ikke, at de hellige skulle dømme Verden? og når
      Verden dømmes ved eder, ere I da uværdige til at sidde til Doms
      i de ringeste Sager?
  3.  Vide I ikke, at vi skulle dømme Engle? end sige da i timelige
      Ting!
  4.  Når I da have Sager om timelige Ting, sætte I da dem til
      Dommere, som ere agtede for intet i Menigheden?
  5.  Til Skam for eder siger jeg det: Er der da slet ingen viis
      iblandt eder, som kan dømme sine Brødre imellem?
  6.  Men Broder fører Sag imod Broder, og det for vantro!
  7.  Overhovedet er jo allerede det en Fejl hos eder, at I have
      Retssager med hverandre. Hvorfor lide I ikke hellere Uret?
      hvorfor lade I eder ikke hellere plyndre?
  8.  Men I gøre Uret og plyndre, og det Brødre!
  9.  Eller vide I ikke, at uretfærdige skulle ikke arve Guds Rige?
      Farer ikke vild! Hverken utugtige eller Afgudsdyrkere eller
      Horkarle eller de som lade sig bruge til unaturlig Utugt, eller
      de, som øve den,
 10.  eller Tyve eller havesyge eller Drankere, ingen Skændegæster,
      ingen Røvere skulle arve Guds Rige.
 11.  Og sådanne vare I for en Del; men I lode eder aftvætte, ja, I
      bleve helligede, ja, I bleve retfærdiggjorte ved den Herres Jesu
      Navn og ved vor Guds Ånd.

 12.  Alt er mig tilladt, men ikke alt er gavnligt; alt er mig
      tilladt, men jeg skal ikke lade mig beherske af noget.
 13.  Maden er for Bugen og Bugen for Maden; men Gud skal tilintetgøre
      både denne og hin. Legemet derimod er ikke for Utugt, men for
      Herren, og Herren for Legemet;
 14.  og Gud har både oprejst Herren og skal oprejse os ved sin Kraft.
 15.  Vide I ikke, at eders Legemer ere Kristi Lemmer? Skal jeg da
      tage Kristi Lemmer og gøre Skøgelemmer deraf? Det være langt
      fra!
 16.  Eller vide I ikke, at den, som holder sig til Skøgen, er eet
      Legeme med hende?"Thi de to," hedder det,"skulle blive til eet
      Kød."
 17.  Men den, som holder sig til Herren, er een Ånd med ham.
 18.  Flyr Utugt! Enhver Synd, som et Menneske ellers gør, er uden for
      Legemet; men den, som bedriver Utugt, synder imod sit eget
      Legeme.
 19.  Eller vide I ikke, at eders Legeme er et Tempel for den
      Helligånd, som er i eder, hvilken I have fra Gud, og at I ikke
      ere eders egne?
 20.  Thi I bleve købte dyrt; ærer derfor Gud i eders Legeme!

1.Korinterne 7

  1.  Men hvad det angår, hvorom I skreve til mig, da er det godt for
      en Mand ikke at røre en Kvinde;
  2.  men for Utugts Skyld have hver Mand sin egen Hustru, og hver
      Kvinde have sin egen Mand.
  3.  Manden yde Hustruen sin Skyldighed; ligeledes også Hustruen
      Manden.
  4.  Hustruen råder ikke over sit eget Legeme, men Manden; ligeså
      råder heller ikke Manden over sit eget Legeme, men Hustruen.
  5.  Unddrager eder ikke hinanden, uden måske med fælles Samtykke,
      til en Tid, for at I kunne have Ro til Bønnen, og for så atter
      at være sammen, for at Satan ikke skal friste eder, fordi I ikke
      formå at være afholdende.
  6.  Men dette siger jeg som en Indrømmelse, ikke som en Befaling.
  7.  Jeg ønsker dog, at alle Mennesker måtte være, som jeg selv er;
      men hver har sin egen Nådegave fra Gud, den ene så, den anden
      så.

  8.  Til de ugifte og til Enkerne siger jeg, at det er godt for dem,
      om de forblive som jeg.
  9.  Men kunne de ikke være afholdende, da lad dem gifte sig; thi det
      er bedre at gifte sig end at lide Brynde.

 10.  Men de gifte byder ikke jeg, men Herren, at en Hustru ikke skal
      skille sig fra sin Mand; (11 men om hun virkeligt skiller sig
      fra ham, da forblive hun ugift eller forlige sig med Manden;) og
      at en Mand ikke skal forlade sin Hustru.

 12.  Men til de andre siger jeg, ikke Herren: Dersom nogen Broder har
      en vantro Hustru, og denne samtykker i at bo hos ham, så forlade
      han hende ikke!
 13.  Og dersom en Hustru har en vantro Mand, og denne samtykker i at
      bo hos hende, så forlade hun ikke Manden!
 14.  Thi den vantro Mand er helliget ved Hustruen, og den vantro
      Hustru er helliget ved Manden; ellers vare jo eders Børn urene,
      men nu ere de hellige.
 15.  Men skiller den vantro sig, så lad ham skille sig; ingen Broder
      eller Søster er trælbunden i sådanne Tilfælde; men Gud har
      kaldet os til Fred.
 16.  Thi hvad ved du, Hustru! om du kan frelse din Mand? eller hvad
      ved du, Mand! om du kan frelse din Hustru?
 17.  Kun vandre enhver således, som Herren har tildelt ham, som Gud
      har kaldet ham; og således forordner jeg i alle Menighederne.
 18.  Blev nogen kaldet som omskåren, han lade ikke Forhud drage over;
      er nogen kaldet som uomskåren, han lade sig ikke omskære!
 19.  Omskærelse har intet at sige, og Forhud har intet at sige, men
      det at holde Guds Bud.
 20.  Hver blive i den Stand, hvori han blev kaldet!
 21.  Blev du kaldet som Træl, da lad det ikke bekymre dig, men om du
      også kan blive fri, da gør hellere Brug deraf!
 22.  Thi den, der er kaldet i Herren som Træl, er Herrens frigivne;
      ligeså er den, der er kaldet som fri, Kristi Træl.
 23.  Dyrt bleve I købte, vorde ikke Menneskers Trælle!
 24.  I den Stand, hvori enhver blev kaldet, Brødre, deri blive han
      for Gud!

 25.  Men om Jomfruerne har jeg ikke nogen Befaling fra Herren, men
      giver min Mening til Hende som den, hvem Herren barmhjertigt har
      forundt at være troværdig.
 26.  Jeg mener altså dette, at det på Grund af den forhåndenværende
      Nød er godt for et Menneske at være således, som han er.
 27.  Er du bunden til en Kvinde, da søg ikke at blive løst; er du
      ikke bunden, da søg ikke en Hustru!
 28.  Men om du også gifter dig, synder du ikke; og om en Jomfru
      gifter sig, synder hun ikke; dog ville sådanne få Trængsel i
      Kødet. Men jeg skåner eder.
 29.  Men dette siger jeg eder, Brødre! at Tiden er kort, for at
      herefter både de, der have Hustruer, skulle være, som om de
      ingen have,
 30.  og de, der græde, som om de ikke græde, og de, der glæde sig,
      som om de ikke glæde sig, og de, der købe, som om de ikke
      besidde,
 31.  og de, der bruge denne Verden, som om de ikke gøre Brug af den;
      thi denne Verdens Skikkelse forgår.
 32.  Men jeg ønsker, at I må være uden Bekymring. Den ugifte er
      bekymret for de Ting, som høre Herren til, hvorledes han kan
      behage Herren;
 33.  men den gifte er bekymret for de Ting, som høre Verden til,
      hvorledes han kan behage Hustruen.
 34.  Og der er også Forskel imellem Hustruen og Jomfruen. Den ugifte
      er bekymret for de Ting, som høre Herren til, for at hun kan
      være hellig både på Legeme og Ånd; men den gifte er bekymret for
      det, som hører Verden til, hvor ledes hun kan behage Manden.
 35.  Men dette siger jeg til eders eget Gavn, ikke for at kaste en
      Snare om eder, men for at bevare Sømmelighed og en urokkelig
      Vedhængen ved Herren.
 36.  Men dersom nogen mener at volde sin ugifte Datter Skam, om hun
      sidder over Tiden, og det må så være, han gøre, hvad han vil,
      han synder ikke; lad dem gifte sig!
 37.  Men den, som står fast i sit Hjerte og ikke er tvungen, men har
      Rådighed over sin Villie og har besluttet dette i sit Hjerte at
      holde sin Datter ugift, han gør vel.
 38.  Altså, både den, som bortgifter sin Datter, gør vel, og den, som
      ikke bortgifter hende, gør bedre.

 39.  En Hustru er bunden, så længe hendes Mand lever; men dersom
      Manden sover hen, er hun fri til at gifte sig med hvem hun vil,
      kun at det sker i Herren.
 40.  Men lykkeligere er hun, om hun forbliver således, som hun er,
      efter min Mening; men også jeg mener at have Guds Ånd.

1.Korinterne 8

  1.  Men hvad Kødet fra Afgudsofrene angår, da vide vi, fordi vi alle
      have Kundskab (Kundskaben opblæser, men Kærligheden opbygger.
  2.  Dersom nogen tykkes at kende noget, han kender endnu ikke
      således, som man bør kende.
  3.  Men dersom nogen elsker Gud, han er kendt af ham.)
  4.  Hvad altså Spisningen af Offerkødet angår, da vide vi, at der er
      ingen, Afgud i Verden, og at der ingen Gud er uden een.
  5.  Thi om der end er såkaldte Guder, være sig i Himmelen eller på
      Jorden, som der jo er mange Guder og mange Herrer,
  6.  så er der for os dog kun een Gud, Faderen, af hvem alle Ting
      ere, og vi til ham, og een Herre, Jesus Kristus, ved hvem alle
      Ting ere, og vi ved ham.

  7.  Dog ikke alle have den Kundskab. Men der er nogle, som ifølge
      deres hidtidige Afgudsvane spise det som Afgudsofferkød, og
      deres Samvittighed, som er skrøbelig, besmittes.
  8.  Men Mad skal ikke bestemme vor Stilling over for Gud; hverken
      have vi Fortrin, om vi spise, eller stå tilbage, om vi ikke
      spise.
  9.  Men ser, til, at ikke denne eders Frihed skal blive til Anstød
      for de skrøbelige!
 10.  Thi dersom nogen ser dig, som har Kundskab, sidde til Bords i et
      Afgudshus, vil så ikke Samvittigheden hos den, som er skrøbelig,
      blive opbygget til at spise Afgudsofferkødet?
 11.  Den skrøbelige går jo til Grunde ved din Kundskab, Broderen, for
      hvis Skyld Kristus er død.
 12.  Men når I således Synde imod Brødrene og såre deres skrøbelige
      Samvittighed, Synde I imod Kristus.
 13.  Derfor, om Mad forarger min Broder, vil jeg aldrig i Evighed
      spise Kød, for at jeg ikke skal forarge min Broder.

1.Korinterne 9

  1.  Er jeg ikke fri? er jeg ikke Apostel? har jeg ikke set Jesus,
      vor Herre? er I ikke min Gerning i Herren?
  2.  Er jeg ikke Apostel for andre, så er jeg det dog i det mindste
      for eder; thi Seglet på min Apostelgerning ere I i Herren.
  3.  Dette er mit Forsvar imod dem, som bedømme mig.
  4.  Have vi ikke Ret til at spise og drikke?
  5.  Have vi ikke Ret til at føre en Søster med om som Hustru, som
      også de andre Apostle og Herrens Brødre og Kefas?
  6.  Eller have alene jeg og Barnabas ingen Ret til at lade være at
      arbejde?
  7.  Hvem tjener vel nogen Sinde i Krig på egen Sold? Hvem planter en
      Vingård og spiser ikke dens Frugt? Eller hvem vogter en Hjord og
      nyder ikke af Hjordens Mælk?
  8.  Taler jeg vel dette blot efter menneskelig Vis, eller siger ikke
      også Loven dette?
  9.  Thi i Mose Lov er der skrevet: "Du må ikke binde Munden til på
      en Okse, som tærsker." Er det Okserne, Gud bekymrer sig om,
 10.  eller siger han det ikke i hvert Tilfælde for vor Skyld? For vor
      Skyld blev det jo skrevet, fordi den, som pløjer, bør pløje i
      Håb, og den, som tærsker, bør gøre det i Håb om at få sin Del.
 11.  Når vi have sået eder de åndelige Ting, er det da noget stort,
      om vi høste eders timelige?
 12.  Dersom andre nyde sådan Ret over eder, kunde da vi ikke snarere?
      Dog have vi ikke brugt denne Ret; men vi tåle alt, for at vi
      ikke skulle lægge noget i Vejen for Kristi Evangelium.
 13.  Vide I ikke, at de, som udføre de hellige Tjenester, få deres
      Føde fra Helligdommen, de, som tjene ved Alteret, dele med
      Alteret?
 14.  Således har også Herren forordnet for dem, som forkynde
      Evangeliet, at de skulle leve af Evangeliet.
 15.  Jeg derimod har ikke gjort Brug af noget af dette. Jeg skriver
      dog ikke dette, for at det skal ske således med mig; thi jeg vil
      hellere dø, end at nogen skulde gøre min Ros til intet.
 16.  Thi om jeg forkynder Evangeliet, har jeg ikke noget at rose mig
      af; der påligger mig nemlig en Nødvendighed, thi ve mig, om jeg
      ikke forkynder det!
 17.  Gør jeg nemlig dette af fri Villie, så får jeg Løn; men har jeg
      imod min Villie fået en Husholdning betroet,
 18.  hvad er da min Løn? For at jeg, når jeg forkynder Evangeliet,
      skal fremsætte det for intet, så at jeg ikke gør Brug af min Ret
      i Evangeliet.

 19.  Thi skønt jeg er fri over for alle, har jeg dog gjort mig selv
      til Tjener for alle, for at jeg kunde vinde des flere.
 20.  Og jeg er bleven Jøderne som en Jøde, for at jeg kunde vinde
      Jøder; dem under Loven som en under Loven, skønt jeg ikke selv
      er under Loven, for at jeg kunde vinde dem, som ere under Loven;
 21.  dem uden for Loven som en uden for Loven, skønt jeg ikke er uden
      Lov for God, men under Kristi Lov, for at jeg kunde vinde dem,
      som ere uden for Loven.
 22.  Jeg er bleven skrøbelig for de skrøbelige, for at jeg kunde
      vinde de skrøbelige; jeg er bleven alt for alle, for at jeg i
      ethvert Fald kunde frelse nogle.
 23.  Men alt gør jeg for Evangeliets Skyld, for at jeg kan blive
      meddelagtig deri.

 24.  Vide I ikke, at de, som løbe på Banen, løbe vel alle, men ikkun
      een får Prisen? Således skulle I løbe, for at I kunne vinde den.
 25.  Enhver, som deltager i Kamplegene, er afholdende i alt; hine nu
      vel for at få en forkrænkelig Krans, men vi en uforkrænkelig.
 26.  Jeg løber derfor ikke som på det uvisse jeg fægter som en, der
      ikke slår i Luften;
 27.  men jeg bekæmper mit Legeme og holder det i Trældom, for at ikke
      jeg, som har prædiket for andre, selv skal blive forkastet.

1.Korinterne 10

  1.  Thi jeg vil ikke, Brødre, at I skulle være uvidende om, at vore
      Fædre vare alle under Skyen og gik alle igennem Havet
  2.  og bleve alle døbte til Moses i Skyen og i Havet
  3.  og spiste alle den samme åndelige Mad
  4.  og drak alle den samme åndelige Drik; thi de drak af en åndelig
      Klippe, som fulgte med; men Klippen var Kristus.
  5.  Alligevel fandt Gud ikke Behag i de fleste af dem; thi de bleve
      slagne ned i Ørkenen.
  6.  Men disse Ting skete som Forbilleder for os, for at vi ikke
      skulle begære, hvad ondt er, således som hine begærede.
  7.  Bliver ej heller Afgudsdyrkere som nogle af dem, ligesom der er
      skrevet: "Folket satte sig ned at spise og drikke, og de stode
      op at lege."
  8.  Lader os ej heller bedrive Utugt, som nogle af dem bedreve
      Utugt, og der faldt på een Dag tre og tyve Tusinde.
  9.  Lader os ej heller friste Herren, som nogle af dem fristede ham
      og bleve ødelagte af Slanger.
 10.  Knurrer ej heller, som nogle af dem knurrede og bleve ødelagte
      af Ødelæggeren.
 11.  Men dette skete dem forbilledligt, men det blev skrevet til
      Advarsel for os, til hvem Tidernes Ende er kommen.
 12.  Derfor den, som tykkes at stå, se til, at han ikke falder!
 13.  Der er ikke kommet andre end menneskelige Fristelser over eder,
      og trofast er Gud, som ikke vil tillade, at I fristes over Evne,
      men som sammen med Fristelsen vil skabe også Udgangen af den,
      for at I må kunne udholde den.

 14.  Derfor, mine elskede, flyr fra Afgudsdyrkelsen!
 15.  Jeg taler som til forstandige; dømmer selv, hvad jeg siger.
 16.  Velsignelsens Kalk, som vi velsigne, er den ikke Samfund med
      Kristi Blod? det Brød, som vi bryde, er det ikke Samfund med
      Kristi Legeme?
 17.  Fordi der er eet Brød, ere vi mange eet Legeme; thi vi få alle
      Del i det ene Brød.
 18.  Ser til Israel efter Kødet; have de, som spise Ofrene, ikke
      Samfund med Alteret?
 19.  Hvad siger jeg da? At Afgudsofferkød er noget? eller at en Afgud
      er noget?
 20.  Nej! men hvad Hedningerne ofre, ofre de til onde Ånder og ikke
      til Gud; men jeg vil ikke,at I skulle få Samfund med de onde
      Ånder.
 21.  I kunne ikke drikke Herrens Kalk og onde Ånders Kalk; I kunne
      ikke være delagtige i Herrens Bord og i onde Ånders Bord.
 22.  Eller skulle vi vække Herrens Nidkærhed? Mon vi ere stærkere end
      han?

 23.  Alt er tilladt, men ikke alt er gavnligt; alt er tilladt, men
      ikke alt opbygger.
 24.  Ingen søge sit eget, men Næstens!
 25.  Alt, hvad der sælges i Slagterbod, spiser det, uden at undersøge
      noget af Samvittigheds-Hensyn;
 26.  thi Herrens er Jorden og dens Fylde.
 27.  Dersom nogen af de vantro indbyder eder, og I ville gå derhen,
      da spiser alt det, som sættes for eder, uden at undersøge noget
      af Samvittigheds-Hensyn.
 28.  Men dersom nogen siger til eder: "Dette er Offerkød," da lad
      være at spise for hans Skyld, som gav det til Kende, og for
      Samvittighedens Skyld.
 29.  Samvittigheden siger jeg, ikke ens egen, men den andens; thi
      hvorfor skal min Frihed dømmes af en anden Samvittighed?
 30.  Dersom jeg nyder det med Taksigelse, hvorfor hører jeg da ilde
      for det, som jeg takker for?
 31.  Hvad enten I derfor spise eller drikke, eller hvad I gøre, da
      gører alt til Guds Ære!
 32.  Værer uden Anstød både for Jøder og Grækere og for Guds
      Menighed,
 33.  ligesom også jeg i alt stræber at tækkes alle, idet jeg ikke
      søger, hvad der gavner mig selv, men hvad der gavner de mange,
      for at de kunne frelses.  (Kap.11.) 1 Vorder mine Efterfølgere,
      ligesom også jeg er Kristi!

1.Korinterne 11
  2.  Men jeg roser eder, fordi I komme mig i Hu i alt og holde fast
      ved Overleveringerne, således som jeg har overleveret eder dem.
  3.  Men jeg vil, at I skulle vide, at Kristus er enhver Mands Hoved;
      men Manden er Kvindens Hoved; men Gud er Kristi Hoved.
  4.  Hver Mand, som beder eller profeterer med tildækket Hoved,
      beskæmmer sit Hoved.
  5.  Men hver Kvinde, som beder eller profeterer med utildækket
      Hoved, beskæmmer sit Hoved; thi det er lige det samme, som var
      hun raget.
  6.  Thi når en Kvinde ikke tildækker sig, så lad hende også klippe
      sit Hår af; men er det usømmeligt for en Kvinde at klippes eller
      rages, da tildække hun sig!  7Thi en Mand bør ikke tildække sit
      Hoved, efterdi han er Guds Billede og Ære; men Kvinden er
      Mandens Ære.
  8.  Mand er jo ikke af Kvinde, men Kvinde af Mand.
  9.  Ej heller er jo Mand skabt for Kvindens Skyld, men Kvinde for
      Mandens Skyld.
 10.  Derfor bør Kvinden have et Ærbødighedstegn på Hovedet for
      Englenes Skyld.
 11.  Dog er hverken Kvinde uden Mand eller Mand uden Kvinde i Herren.
 12.  Thi ligesom Kvinden er af Manden, således er også Manden ved
      Kvinden; men alt sammen er det af Gud.
 13.  Dømmer selv: Er det sømmeligt, at en Kvinde beder til Gud med
      utildækket Hoved?
 14.  Lærer ikke også selve Naturen eder, at når en Mand bærer langt
      Hår, er det ham en Vanære,
 15.  men når en Kvinde bærer langt Hår, er det hende en Ære; thi det
      lange Hår er givet hende som et Slør.
 16.  Men har nogen Lyst til at trættes herom, da have vi ikke sådan
      Skik, og Guds Menigheder ej heller.

 17.  Men idet jeg giver følgende Formaning, roser jeg ikke, at I
      komme sammen, ikke til det bedre, men til det værre.
 18.  For det første nemlig hører jeg, at når I komme sammen i
      Menighedsforsamling, er der Splittelser iblandt eder; og for en
      Del tror jeg det.
 19.  Thi der må endog være Partier iblandt eder, for at de prøvede
      kunne blive åbenbare iblandt eder.
 20.  Når I da komme sammen, er dette ikke at æde en Herrens Nadver.
 21.  Thi under Spisningen tager enhver sit eget Måltid forud, og den
      ene hungrer, den anden beruser sig.
 22.  Have I da ikke Huse til at spise og drikke i? eller foragte I
      Guds Menighed og beskæmme dem, som intet have? Hvad skal jeg
      sige eder?  Skal jeg rose eder? I dette roser jeg eder ikke.
 23.  Thi jeg har modtaget fra Herren, hvad jeg også har overleveret
      eder: At den Herre Jesus i den Nat, da han blev forrådt, tog
      Brød,
 24.  takkede og brød det og sagde: "Dette er mit Legeme, som er for
      eder; gører dette til min Ihukommelse!"
 25.  Ligeså tog han og,så Kalken efter Aftensmåltidet og sagde:
      "Denne Kalk er den nye Pagt i mit Blod; gører dette, så ofte som
      I drikke det, til min Ihukommelse!"
 26.  Thi så ofte, som I æde dette Brød og drikke Kalken, forkynde I
      Herrens Død, indtil han kommer.
 27.  Derfor, den, som æder Brødet eller drikker Herrens Kalk
      uværdigt, pådrager sig Skyld over for Herrens Legeme og Blod.
 28.  Men hvert Menneske prøve sig selv, og således æde han af Brødet
      og drikke af Kalken!
 29.  Thi den, som æder og drikker, æder og drikker sig selv en Dom
      til, når han ikke agter på Legenet.
 30.  Derfor ere mange skrøbelige og sygelige iblandt eder, og en Del
      sover hen.
 31.  Men dersom vi bedømte os selv, bleve vi ikke dømte.
 32.  Men når vi dømmes, tugtes vi af Herren, for at vi ikke skulle
      fordømmes med Verden.
 33.  Derfor, mine Brødre! når I komme sammen til Måltid, da venter på
      hverandre!
 34.  Når nogen hungrer, han spise hjemme, for at I ikke skulle komme
      sammen til Dom. Men det øvrige skal jeg forordne, når jeg
      kommer.

1.Korinterne 12

  1.  Men hvad de åndelige Gaver angår, Brødre! vil jeg ikke, at I
      skulle være uvidende.
  2.  I vide, at da I vare Hedninger, droges I hen til de stumme
      Afguder, som man drog eder.
  3.  Derfor kundgør jeg eder, at ingen, som taler ved Guds Ånd,
      siger: "Jesus er en Forbandelse," og ingen kan sige: "Jesus er
      Herre" uden ved den Helligånd.

  4.  Der er Forskel på Nådegaver, men det er den samme Ånd;
  5.  og der er Forskel på Tjenester, og det er den samme Herre;
  6.  og der er Forskel på kraftige Gerninger, men det er den samme
      Gud, som virker alt i alle.
  7.  Men til enhver gives Åndens Åbenbarelse til det, som er
      gavnligt.
  8.  En gives der nemlig ved Ånden Visdoms Tale; en anden Kundskabs
      Tale ifølge den samme Ånd;
  9.  en anden Tro i den samme Ånd; en anden Gaver til at helbrede i
      den ene Ånd;
 10.  en anden at udføre kraftige Gerninger; en anden profetisk Gave;
      en anden at bedømme Ånder; en anden forskellige Slags Tungetale;
      en anden Udlægning af Tungetale.
 11.  Men alt dette virker den ene og samme Ånd, som uddeler til
      enhver især; efter som han vil.

 12.  Thi ligesom Legemet er eet og har mange Lemmer, men alle
      Legemets Lemmer, skønt de ere mange, dog ere eet Legeme, således
      også Kristus.
 13.  Thi med een Ånd bleve vi jo alle døbte til at være eet Legeme,
      hvad enten vi ere Jøder eller Grækere, Trælle eller frie; og
      alle fik vi een Ånd at drikke
 14.  Legemet er jo heller ikke eet Lem, men mange.
 15.  Dersom Foden vilde sige: "Fordi jeg ikke er Hånd, hører jeg ikke
      til Legemet," så ophører den dog ikke derfor at høre til
      Legemet.
 16.  Og dersom Øret vilde sige: "Fordi jeg ikke er Øje, hører jeg
      ikke til Legemet," så ophører det dog ikke derfor at høre til
      Legemet.
 17.  Dersom hele Legemet var Øje, hvor blev da Hørelsen? Dersom det
      helt var Hørelse, hvor blev da Lugten?
 18.  Men nu har Gud sat Lemmerne, ethvert af dem, på Legemet, efter
      som han vilde.
 19.  Men dersom de alle vare eet Lem, hvor blev da Legemet?
 20.  Nu er der derimod mange Lemmer og dog kun eet Legeme.
 21.  Øjet kan ikke sige til Hånden: "Jeg har dig ikke nødig," eller
      atter Hovedet til Fødderne: "Jeg har eder ikke nødig."
 22.  Nej, langt snarere ere de Lemmer på Legemet nødvendige, som
      synes at være de svageste,
 23.  og de, som synes os mindre ærefolde på Legemet, dem klæde vi med
      des mere Ære; og de Lemmer, vi blues ved, omgives med desto
      større Blufærdighed;
 24.  de derimod, som vi ikke blues ved, have det ikke nødig. Men Gud
      har sammenføjet Legemet således, at han tillagde det ringere
      mere Ære;
 25.  for at der ikke skal være Splid i Legemet, men, for at Lemmerne
      skulle have samme Omsorg for hverandre;
 26.  og hvad enten eet Lem lider, lide alle Lemmerne med, eller eet
      Lem bliver hædret, glæde alle Lemmerne sig med.
 27.  Men I ere Kristi Legeme, og Lemmer enhver især.
 28.  Og nogle satte Gud i Menigheden for det første til Apostle, for
      det andet til Profeter, for det tredje til Lærere, dernæst
      kraftige Gerninger, dernæst Gaver til at helbrede. til at
      hjælpe, til at styre, og forskellige Slags Tungetale.
 29.  Mon alle ere Apostle? mon alle ere Profeter? mon alle ere
      Lærere?  mon alle gøre kraftige Gerninger?
 30.  mon alle have Gaver til at helbrede? mon alle tale i Tunger? mon
      alle udlægge?
 31.  Men tragter efter de største Nådegaver! Og yder mere viser jeg
      eder en ypperlig Vej.

1.Korinterne 13

  1.  Taler jeg med Menneskers og Engles Tunger, men ikke har
      Kærlighed, da er jeg bleven et lydende Malm eller en klingende
      Bjælde.
  2.  Og har jeg profetisk Gave og kender alle Hemmelighederne og al
      Kundskaben, og har jeg al Troen, så at jeg kan flytte Bjerge,
      men ikke har Kærlighed, da er jeg intet.
  3.  Og uddeler jeg alt, hvad jeg ejer, til de fattige og giver mit
      Legeme hen til at brændes, men ikke har Kærlighed, da gavner det
      mig intet.

  4.  Kærligheden er langmodig, er velvillig; Kærligheden bærer ikke
      Nid; Kærligheden praler ikke, opblæses ikke,
  5.  gør intet usømmeligt, søger ikke sit eget, forbitres ikke,
      tilregner ikke det onde;
  6.  glæder sig ikke over Uretfærdigheden, men glæder sig ved
      Sandheden;
  7.  den tåler alt, tror alt, håber alt, udholder alt.

  8.  Kærligheden bortfalder aldrig; men enten det er profetiske
      Gaver, de skulle forgå, eller Tungetale, den skal ophøre, eller
      Kundskab, den skal forgå;
  9.  thi vi kende stykkevis og profetere stykkevis;
 10.  men når det fuldkomne kommer, da skal det stykkevise forgå.
 11.  Da jeg var Barn, talte jeg som et Barn, tænkte jeg som et Barn,
      dømte jeg som et Barn; efter at jeg er bleven Mand, har jeg
      aflagt det barnagtige.
 12.  Nu se vi jo i et Spejl, i en Gåde, men da skulle vi se Ansigt
      til Ansigt; nu kender jeg stykkevis, men da skal jeg erkende,
      ligesom jeg jo blev erkendt.
 13.  Så blive da Tro, Håb, Kærlighed disse tre; men størst iblandt
      disse er Kærligheden.

1.Korinterne 14

  1.  Higer efter Kærligheden, og tragter efter de åndelige Gaver men
      mest efter at profetere.
  2.  Thi den; som taler i Tunger, taler ikke for Mennesker, men for
      Gud; thi ingen forstår det, men han taler Hemmeligheder i Ånden.
  3.  Men den, som profeterer, taler Mennesker til Opbyggelse og
      Formaning og Trøst.
  4.  Den, som taler i Tunger, opbygger sig selv; men den, som
      profeterer, opbygger en Menighed.
  5.  Men jeg ønsker, at I alle måtte tale i Tunger, men endnu
      hellere, at I måtte profetere; den, som profeterer, er større
      end den, som taler i Tunger, med mindre han udlægger det, for at
      Menigheden kan få Opbyggelse deraf.
  6.  Men nu, Brødre! dersom jeg kommer til eder og taler i Tunger,
      hvad vil jeg da gavne eder, hvis jeg ikke taler til eder enten
      ved Åbenbaring eller ved Kundskab, enten ved Profeti eller ved
      Lære?
  7.  Selv de livløse Ting, som give Lyd, være sig en Fløjte eller en
      Harpe, når de ikke gøre Skel imellem Tonerne, hvorledes skal man
      så kunne forstå, hvad der spilles på Fløjten eller Harpen?
  8.  Ja, også når en Basun giver en utydelig Lyd, hvem vil da berede
      sig til Krig?
  9.  Således også med eder: dersom I ikke ved Tungen fremføre tydelig
      Tale, hvorledes skal man da kunne forstå det, som tales? I ville
      jo tale hen i Vejret.
 10.  Der er i Verden, lad os sige, så og så mange Slags Sprog, og der
      er intet af dem, som ikke har sin Betydning.
 11.  Dersom jeg nu ikke kender Sprogets Betydning, bliver jeg en
      Barbar for den, som taler, og den, som taler, bliver en Barbar
      for mig.
 12.  Således også med eder: når I tragte efter åndelige Gaver, da lad
      det være til Menighedens Opbyggelse, at I søge at blive rige
      derpå
 13.  " Derfor, den, som taler i Tunger, han bede om, at han må kunne
      udlægge det.
 14.  Thi dersom: jeg taler i Tunger og beder, da beder. vel min Ånd,
      men min Forstand er uden Frugt.
 15.  Hvad da? Jeg vil bede med Ånden, men jeg vil også bede med
      Forstanden; jeg vil lovsynge med Ånden, men jeg vil også
      lovsynge med Forstanden.
 16.  Ellers, når du priser Gud i Ånden, hvorledes vil da den, som
      indtager den uindviedes Plads, kunne sige sit Amen til din
      Taksigelse, efterdi han ikke ved, hvad du siger?
 17.  Thi vel er din Taksigelse smuk, men den anden opbygges ikke.
 18.  Jeg takker Gud for, at jeg mere end I alle taler i Tunger.
 19.  Men i en Menighed vil jeg hellere tale fem Ord med min Forstand,
      for at jeg også kan undervise andre, end ti Tusinde Ord i
      Tunger.
 20.  Brødre! vorder ikke Børn i Forstand, men værer Børn i Ondskab, i
      Forstand derimod vorder fuldvoksne!
 21.  Der er skrevet i Loven: "Ved Folk med fremmede Tungemål og ved
      fremmedes Læber vil jeg tale til dette Folk, og de skulle end
      ikke således høre mig, siger Herren."
 22.  Således er Tungetalen til et Tegn, ikke for dem, som tro, men
      for de vantro; men den profetiske Gave er det ikke for de
      vantro, men for dem, som tro.
 23.  Når altså den hele Menighed kommer sammen, og alle tale i
      Tunger, men der kommer uindviede eller vantro ind, ville de da
      ikke sige, at I rase?
 24.  Men dersom alle profetere, og der kommer nogen vantro eller
      uindviet ind, da overbevises han af alle, han bedømmes af alle,
 25.  hans Hjertes skjulte Tanker åbenbares, og så vil han falde på
      sit Ansigt og tilbede Gud og forkynde, at Gud er virkelig i
      eder.

 26.  Hvad da Brødre? Når I komme sammen, da har enhver en Lovsang, en
      Lære, en Åbenbaring, en Tungetale, en Udlægning; alt ske til
      Opbyggelse!
 27.  Dersom nogen taler i Tunger, da være det to, eller i det højeste
      tre hver Gang, og den ene efter den anden, og een udlægge det!
 28.  Men dersom der ingen Udlægger er til Stede, da tie hin i
      Menigheden, men han tale for sig selv og for Gud!
 29.  Men af Profeter tale to eller tre, og de andre bedømme det;
 30.  men dersom en anden, som sidder der, får en Åbenbarelse, da tie
      den første!
 31.  Thi I kunne alle profetere, den ene efter den anden, for at alle
      kunne lære, og alle blive formanede,
 32.  og Profeters Ånder ere Profeter undergivne.
 33.  Thi Gud er ikke Forvirringens, men Fredens Gud. Ligesom i alle
      de helliges Menigheder

 34.  skulle eders Kvinder tie i Forsamlingerne; thi det tilstedes dem
      ikke at tale, men lad dem underordne sig, ligesom også Loven
      siger.
 35.  Men ville de lære noget, da adspørge de deres egne Mænd hjemme;
      thi det er usømmeligt for en Kvinde at tale i en
      Menighedsforsamling.
 36.  Eller er det fra eder, at Guds Ord er udgået? eller er det til
      eder alene, at det er kommet?

 37.  Dersom nogen tykkes, at han er en Profet eller åndelig, han
      erkende, at hvad jeg skriver til eder, er Herrens Bud.
 38.  Men er nogen uvidende derom, så får han være uvidende!
 39.  Altså, mine Brødre! tragter efter at profetere og forhindrer
      ikke Talen i Tunger!
 40.  Men alt ske sømmeligt og med Orden!

1.Korinterne 15

  1.  Men jeg kundgør eder, Brødre, det Evangelium, som jeg Forkyndte
      eder, hvilket I også modtoge, i hvilket I også stå,
  2.  ved hvilket I også frelses, hvis I fastholde, med hvilket Ord
      jeg forkyndte eder det - ellers troede I forgæves.
  3.  Jeg overleverede eder nemlig som noget af det første, hvad jeg
      også har modtaget: at Kristus døde for vore Synder,efter
      Skrifterne;
  4.  og at han blev begravet; og at han er bleven oprejst den tredje
      Dag, efter Skrifterne;
  5.  og at han blev set af Kefas, derefter af de tolv;
  6.  derefter blev han set af over fem Hundrede Brødre på een Gang,
      af hvilke de fleste endnu ere i Live, men nogle ere hensovede;.
  7.  derefter blev han set af Jakob, dernæst af alle Apostlene;
  8.  men sidst af alle blev han set også af mig som det ufuldbårne
      Foster;
  9.  thi jeg er den ringeste af Apostlene, jeg, som ikke er værd at
      kaldes Apostel, fordi jeg har forfulgt Guds Menighed.
 10.  Men af Guds Nåde er jeg det, jeg er, og hans Nåde imod mig har
      ikke været forgæves; men jeg har arbejdet mere end de alle, dog
      ikke jeg, men Guds Nåde, som er med mig.
 11.  Hvad enten det da er mig eller de andre, således prædike vi, og
      således troede I.

 12.  Men når der prædikes, at Kristus er oprejst fra de døde,
      hvorledes sige da nogle iblandt eder, at der ikke er dødes
      Opstandelse?
 13.  Dersom der ikke er dødes Opstandelse, da er ikke heller Kristus
      oprejst.
 14.  Men er Kristus ikke oprejst, da er vor Prædiken jo tom, og eders
      Tro også tom.
 15.  Men vi blive da også fundne som falske Vidner om Gud, fordi vi
      have vidnet imod Gud, at han oprejste Kristus, hvem han ikke har
      oprejst, såfremt døde virkelig ikke oprejses.
 16.  Thi dersom døde ikke oprejses, da er Kristus ikke heller
      oprejst.
 17.  Men dersom Kristus ikke er oprejst, da er eders Tro forgæves; så
      ere I endnu i eders Synder;
 18.  da gik altså også de, som ere hensovede i Kristus, fortabt.
 19.  Have vi alene i dette Liv sat vort Håb til Kristus, da ere vi de
      ynkværdigste af alle Mennesker.
 20.  Men nu er Kristus oprejst fra de døde, som Førstegrøde af de
      hensovede.
 21.  Thi efterdi Død kom ved et Menneske, er også dødes Opstandelse
      kommen ved et Menneske.
 22.  Thi ligesom alle dø i Adam, således skulle også alle
      levendegøres i Kristus.
 23.  Dog hver i sit Hold: som Førstegrøde Kristus, dernæst de, som
      tilhøre Kristus, ved hans Tilkommelse.
 24.  Derpå kommer Enden, når han overgiver Gud og Faderen Riget, når
      han har tilintetgjort hver Magt og hver Myndighed og Kraft.
 25.  Thi han bør være Konge, indtil han får lagt alle Fjenderne under
      sine Fødder.
 26.  Den sidste Fjende, som tilintetgøres, er Døden.
 27.  Han har jo "lagt alle Ting under hans Fødder." Men når han"
      siger: "Alt er underlagt" - åbenbart med Undtagelse af den, som
      underlagde ham alt -
 28.  når da alle Ting ere blevne ham underlagte, da skal også Sønnen
      selv underlægge sig ham, som har underlagt ham alle Ting, for at
      Gud kan være alt i alle.

 29.  Hvad ville ellers de udrette, som lade sig døbe for de døde?
      Dersom døde overhovedet ikke oprejses, hvorfor lade de sig da
      døbe for dem?
 30.  Hvorfor udsætte da også vi os hver Time for Fare?
 31.  Jeg dør daglig, så sandt jeg har eder, Brødre, at rose mig af i
      Kristus Jesus, vor Herre.
 32.  Hvis jeg som et almindeligt Menneske har kæmpet med vilde Dyr i
      Efesus, hvad Gavn har jeg så deraf? Dersom døde ikke oprejses,
      da "lader os spise og drikke, thi i Morgen dø vi."
 33.  Farer ikke vild; slet Omgang fordærver gode Sæder!
 34.  Vorder ædrue, som det bør sig, og synder ikke; thi nogle kende
      ikke Gud; til Skam for eder siger jeg det.

 35.  Men man vil sige: "Hvorledes oprejses de døde? hvad Slags Legeme
      komme de med?"
 36.  Du Dåre! det, som du sår, bliver ikke levendegjort, dersom det
      ikke dør.
 37.  Og hvad du end sår, da sår du ikke det Legeme, der skal vorde,
      men et nøgent Korn, være sig af Hvede eller af anden Art.
 38.  Men Gud giver det et Legeme, således som han har villet, og hver
      Sædart sit eget Legeme.
 39.  Ikke alt Kød er det samme Kød, men eet er Menneskers, et andet
      Kvægs Kød, et andet Fugles Kød, et andet Fisks.
 40.  Og der er himmelske Legemer og jordiske Legemer; men een er de
      himmelskes Herlighed, en anden de jordiskes.
 41.  Een er Solens Glans og en anden Månens Glans og en anden
      Stjernernes Glans; thi den ene Stjerne er forskellig fra den
      anden i Glans.
 42.  Således er det også med de dødes Opstandelse: det såes i
      Forkrænkelighed, det oprejses i Uforkrænkelighed;
 43.  det såes i Vanære, det oprejses i Herlighed; det såes i
      Skrøbelighed, det oprejses i Kraft;
 44.  der såes et sjæleligt Legeme, der oprejses et åndeligt Legeme.
      Når der gives et sjæleligt Legeme, gives der også et åndeligt.
 45.  Således er der også skrevet: "Det første Menneske, Adam, blev
      til en levende Sjæl;"den sidste Adam blev til en levendegørende
      Ånd.
 46.  Men det åndelige er ikke det første, men det sjælelige; derefter
      det åndelige.
 47.  Det første Menneske var af Jord, jordisk; det andet Menneske er
      fra Himmelen.
 48.  Sådan som den jordiske var, sådanne ere også de jordiske; og
      sådan som den himmelske er, sådanne ere også de himmelske.
 49.  Og ligesom vi have båret den jordiskes Billede, således skulle
      vi også bære den himmelskes Billede!

 50.  Men dette siger jeg, Brødre! at Kød og Blod kan ikke arve Guds
      Rige, ej heller arver Forkrænkeligheden Uforkrænkeligheden.
 51.  Se, jeg siger eder en Hemmelighed: Alle skulle vi ikke hensove,
      men vi skulle alle forvandles
 52.  i et Nu, i et Øjeblik, ved den sidste Basun; thi Basunen skal
      lyde, og de døde skulle oprejses uforkrænkelige, og vi skulle
      forvandles.
 53.  Thi dette forkrænkelige må iføre sig Uforkrænkelighed, og dette
      dødelige iføre sig Udødelighed.
 54.  Men når dette forkrænkelige har iført sig Uforkrænkelighed, og
      dette dødelige har iført sig Udødelighed, da skal det Ord
      opfyldes, som er skrevet: "Døden er opslugt til Sejr."
 55.  "Død, hvor er din Sejr? Død, hvor er din Brod?"
 56.  Men Dødens Brod er Synden, og Syndens Kraft er Loven.
 57.  Men Gud ske Tak, som giver os Sejren ved vor Herre Jesus
      Kristus!
 58.  Derfor, mine elskede Brødre! bliver faste, urokkelige, altid
      rige i Herrens Gerning, vidende, at eders Arbejde er ikke
      forgæves i Herren.

1.Korinterne 16

  1.  Men hvad Indsamlingen til de hellige angår, da gører også I,
      ligesom jeg forordnede for Menighederne i Galatien!
  2.  Hver første Dag i Ugen lægge enhver af eder hjemme hos sig selv
      noget til Side og samle, hvad han måtte have Lykke til, for at
      der ikke først skal ske Indsamlinger, når jeg kommer.
  3.  Men når jeg kommer, vil jeg sende, hvem I måtte finde skikkede
      dertil, med Breve for at bringe eders Gave til Jerusalem.
  4.  Men dersom det er værd, at også jeg rejser med, da kunne de
      rejse med mig.

  5.  Men jeg vil komme til eder, når jeg er dragen igennem
      Makedonien; thi jeg drager igennem Makedonien;
  6.  men hos eder vil jeg måske blive eller endog overvintre, for at
      I kunne befordre mig videre, hvor jeg så rejser hen.
  7.  Thi nu vil jeg ikke se eder på Gennemrejse; jeg håber nemlig at
      forblive nogen Tid hos eder, om Herren vil tilstede det.
  8.  Men i Efesus vil jeg forblive indtil Pinsen;
  9.  thi en Dør står mig åben, stor og virksom, og der er mange
      Modstandere.

 10.  Men om Timotheus kommer, da ser til, at han kan færdes hos eder
      uden Frygt; thi han gør Herrens Gerning, såvel som jeg.
 11.  Derfor må ingen ringeagte ham; befordrer ham videre i Fred, for
      at han kan komme til mig; thi jeg venter ham med Brødrene.
 12.  Men hvad Broderen Apollos angår, da har jeg meget opfordret ham
      til at komme til eder med Brødrene; men det var i hvert Fald
      ikke hans Villie at komme nu, men han vil komme, når han får
      belejlig Tid.


 13.  Våger, står faste i Troen, værer mandige, værer stærke!
 14.  Alt ske hos eder i Kærlighed!

 15.  Men jeg formaner eder, Brødre - I kende Stefanas's Hus, at det
      er Akajas Førstegrøde, og de have hengivet sig selv til at tjene
      de hellige -
 16.  til at også I skulle underordne eder under sådanne og enhver,
      som arbejder med og har Besvær.
 17.  Men jeg glæder mig ved Stefanas's og Fortunatus's og Akaikus's
      Nærværelse, fordi disse have udfyldt Savnet af eder;
 18.  thi de have vederkvæget min Ånd og eders. Skønner derfor på
      sådanne!

 19.  Menighederne i Asien hilse eder. Akvila og Priska hilse eder
      meget i Herren tillige med Menigheden i deres Hus.
 20.  Alle Brødrene hilse eder. Hilser hverandre med et helligt Kys!

 21.  Hilsenen med min, Paulus's egen Hånd.
 22.  Dersom nogen ikke elsker Herren, han være en Forbandelse! Maran
      Atha.
 23.  Den Herres Jesu Nåde være med eder!
 24.  Min Kærlighed med eder alle i Kristus Jesus!


2.Korinterne

2.Korinterne 1

  1.  Paulus, ved Guds Villie Kristi Jesu Apostel, og Broderen
      Timotheus til Guds Menighed, som er i Korinth, tillige med alle
      de hellige, som ere i hele Akaja:
  2.  Nåde være med eder og Fred fra Gud vor Fader og den Herre Jesus
      Kristus!

  3.  Lovet være Gud og vor Herres Jesu Kristi Fader,
      Barmhjertighedens Fader og al Trøsts Gud,
  4.  som trøster os under al vor Trængsel, for at vi må kunne trøste
      dem, som ere i alle Hånde Trængsel, med den Trøst, hvormed vi
      selv trøstes af Gud!
  5.  Thi ligesom Kristi Lidelser komme rigeligt over os, således
      bliver også vor Trøst rigelig ved Kristus.
  6.  Men hvad enten vi lide Trængsel, sker det til eders Trøst og
      Frelse, eller vi trøstes, sker det til eders Trøst, som viser
      sin Kraft i, at I udholde de samme Lidelser, som også vi lide;
      og vort Håb om eder er fast,
  7.  efterdi vi vide, at ligesom I ere delagtige i Lidelserne,
      således ere I det også i Trøsten.
  8.  Thi vi ville ikke, Brødre! at I skulle være uvidende om den
      Trængsel, som kom over os i Asien, at vi bleve overvættes
      besværede, over Evne, så at vi endog mistvivlede om Livet.
  9.  Ja, selv have vi hos os selv fået det Svar: "Døden", for at vi
      ikke skulde forlade os på os selv, men på Gud, som oprejser de
      døde,
 10.  han, som friede os ud af så stor en Dødsfare og vil fri os, til
      hvem vi have sat vort Håb, at han også fremdeles vil fri os,
 11.  idet også I komme os til Hjælp med Bøn for os, for at der fra
      mange Munde må blive rigeligt takket for os, for den Nåde, som
      er bevist os.

 12.  Thi dette er vor Ros, vor Samvittigheds Vidnesbyrd, at i Guds
      Hellighed og Renhed, ikke i kødelig Visdom, men i Guds Nåde have
      vi færdedes i Verden, men mest hos eder.
 13.  Thi vi skrive eder ikke andet til end det, som I læse eller også
      erkende; men jeg håber, at I indtil Enden skulle erkende,
 14.  ligesom I også til Dels have erkendt om os, at vi ere eders Ros,
      ligesom I ere vor, på den Herres Jesu Dag.
 15.  Og i Tillid hertil havde jeg i Sinde at komme først til eder,
      for at I skulde få Nåde to Gange,
 16.  og om ad eder at drage til Makedonien og atter fra Makedonien at
      komme til eder og blive befordret videre af eder til Judæa.
 17.  Når jeg nu havde dette i Sinde, mon jeg da så handlede i
      Letsindighed? Eller hvad jeg beslutter, beslutter jeg det efter
      Kødet, for at der hos mig skal være Ja, Ja og Nej, Nej?
 18.  Så sandt Gud er trofast, er vor Tale til eder ikke Ja og Nej.
 19.  Thi Guds Søn, Kristus Jesus, som blev prædiket iblandt eder ved
      os, ved mig og Silvanus og Timotheus, han blev ikke Ja og Nej,
      men Ja er vorden i ham.
 20.  Thi så mange, som Guds Forjættelser ere, i ham have de deres Ja;
      derfor få de også ved ham deres Amen, Gud til Ære ved os.
 21.  Men den, som holder os med eder fast til Kristus og salvede os,
      er Gud,
 22.  som også beseglede os og gav os Åndens Pant i vore Hjerter.
 23.  Men jeg kalder Gud til Vidne over min Sjæl på, at det var for at
      skåne eder, at jeg ikke igen kom til Korinth.
 24.  Ikke at vi ere Herrer over eders Tro, men vi ere Medarbejdere på
      eders Glæde; thi i Troen stå I.

2.Korinterne 2

  1.  Men jeg beslutte dette hos mig selv, at jeg vilde ikke atter
      komme til eder med Bedrøvelse.
  2.  Thi dersom jeg bedrøver eder, hvem er da den, som gør mig glad,
      uden den, som bedrøves af mig?
  3.  Og jeg skrev netop derfor, for at jeg ikke, når jeg kom, skulde
      have Bedrøvelse af dem, som jeg burde have Glæde af, idet jeg
      havde den Tillid til eder alle, at min Glæde deles af eder alle.
  4.  Thi ud af stor Hjertets Trængsel og Beklemthed skrev jeg eder
      til, under mange Tårer, ikke for at I skulde blive bedrøvede,
      men for at I skulde kende den Kærlighed, som jeg har særlig til
      eder.

  5.  Men dersom nogen har voldt Bedrøvelse, har han ikke bedrøvet
      mig, men til Dels, for ikke at sige det hårdere, eder alle.
  6.  Det er nok for ham med denne Straf, som han har fået af de
      fleste,
  7.  så at I tværtimod snarere skulle tilgive og trøste ham, for at
      han ikke skal drukne i den alt for store Bedrøvelse.
  8.  Derfor formaner jeg eder til at vedtage at vise ham Kærlighed.
  9.  Det var nemlig også derfor, at jeg skrev, for at erfare, hvor
      vidt I stå Prøve, om I ere lydige i alt.
 10.  Men hvem I tilgive noget, ham tilgiver også jeg; thi også hvad
      jeg selv har tilgivet, om jeg har tilgivet noget, det har jeg
      gjort for eders Skyld, for Kristi Åsyn,
 11.  for at vi ikke skulle bedrages af Satan; thi hans Anslag ere os
      ikke ubekendte.

 12.  Da jeg kom til Troas for at prædike Kristi Evangelium, og der
      var åbnet mig en Dør i Herren,
 13.  da havde jeg ingen Ro i min Ånd, fordi jeg ikke fandt Titus, min
      Broder; men jeg tog Afsked med dem og drog til Makedonien.
 14.  Men Gud ske Tak, som altid fører os i Sejrstog i Kristus og
      lader sin Kundskabs Duft blive kendelig ved os på ethvert Sted.
 15.  Thi en Kristi Vellugt ere vi for Gud, iblandt dem, som frelses,
      og iblandt dem, som fortabes,
 16.  for disse en Duft af Død til Død, for hine en Duft af Liv til
      Liv.  Og hvem er dygtig dertil?
 17.  Thi vi ere ikke som de mange, at vi gøre en Forretning af Guds
      Ord, men som af Renhed, som af Gud tale vi for Guds Åsyn i
      Kristus.

2.Korinterne 3

  1.  Begynde vi atter at anbefale os selv? eller behøve vi, som
      nogle, Anbefalingsbreve til eder eller fra eder?
  2.  I ere vort Brev, som er indskrevet i vore Hjerter, og som kendes
      og læses af alle Mennesker,
  3.  idet det ligger klart som Dagen, at I ere et Kristi Brev,
      udfærdiget af os, indskrevet ikke med Blæk, men med den levende
      Guds Ånd, ikke på Stentavler, men på Hjerters Kødtavler.

  4.  Men en sådan Tillid have vi til Gud ved Kristus,
  5.  ikke at vi af os selv ere dygtige til at udtænke noget som ud af
      os selv; men vor Dygtighed er af Gud,
  6.  som også gjorde os dygtige til at være en ny Pagts Tjenere, ikke
      Bogstavens, men Åndens; thi Bogstaven ihjelslår, men Ånden
      levendegør.
  7.  Men når Dødens Tjeneste, med Bogstaver indristet i Sten,
      fremtrådte i Herlighed, så at Israels Børn ikke kunde fæste Øjet
      på Moses's Ansigt på Grund af hans Ansigts Herlighed, som dog
      forsvandt,
  8.  hvorledes skal da ikke Åndens Tjeneste end mere være i
      Herlighed?
  9.  Thi når Fordømmelsens Tjeneste havde Herlighed, er meget mere
      Retfærdighedens Tjeneste rig på Herlighed.
 10.  Ja, det herlige er jo i dette Tilfælde endog uden Herlighed i
      Sammenligning med den endnu større Herlighed.
 11.  Thi når det, der forsvandt, fremtrådte med Herlighed, da skal
      meget mere det, der bliver, være i Herlighed.
 12.  Efterdi vi altså have et sådant Håb, gå vi frem med stor
      Frimodighed
 13.  og gøre ikke som Moses, der lagde et Dække over sit Ansigt, for
      at Israels Børn ikke skulde fæste Øjet på, at det, der
      forsvandt, fik Ende.
 14.  Men deres Tanker bleve forhærdede; thi indtil den Dag i Dag
      forbliver det samme Dække over Oplæsningen af den gamle Pagt
      uden at tages bort; thi i Kristus er det, at det svinder.
 15.  Men der ligger indtil denne Dag et Dække over deres Hjerte, når
      Moses oplæses;
 16.  når de derimod omvende sig til Herren, da borttages Dækket.
 17.  Men Herren er Ånden, og hvor Herrens Ånd er, er der Frihed.
 18.  Men alle vi, som med ubedækket Ansigt skue Herrens Herlighed som
      i et Spejl, blive forvandlede til det samme Billede, fra
      Herlighed til Herlighed, så som det er fra Åndens Herre.

2.Korinterne 4

  1.  Derfor, da vi have denne Tjeneste efter den Barmhjertighed, som
      er bleven os til Del, så tabe vi ikke Modet;
  2.  men vi have frasagt os de skammelige Smugveje, så vi ikke vandre
      i Træskhed, ej heller forfalske Guds Ord, men ved Sandhedens
      Åbenbarelse anbefale os til alle Menneskers Samvittighed for
      Guds Åsyn.
  3.  Men om også vort Evangelium er tildækket, da er det tildækket
      iblandt dem, som fortabes,
  4.  dem, i hvem denne Verdens Gud har forblindet de vantros Tanker,
      for at Lyset ikke skulde skinne fra Evangeliet om Kristi
      Herlighed, han, som er Guds Billede.
  5.  Thi ikke os selv prædike vi, men Kristus Jesus som Herre, os
      derimod som eders Tjenere for Jesu Skyld.
  6.  Thi Gud, som sagde: "Af Mørke skal Lys skinne frem", han har
      ladet det skinne i vore Hjerter for, at bringe Kundskaben om
      Guds Herlighed på Kristi Åsyn for Lyset.

  7.  Men denne Skat have vi i Lerkar, for at den overvættes Kraft må
      være Guds, og ikke fra os,
  8.  vi, som trænges på alle Måder, men ikke stænges inde, ere
      tvivlrådige, men ikke fortvivlede,
  9.  forfulgte, men ikke forladte, nedslagne, men ikke ihjelslagne,
 10.  altid bærende Jesu Dødelse om i Legemet, for at også Jesu Liv må
      åbenbares i vort Legeme.
 11.  Thi altid overgives vi, som leve, til Død for Jesu Skyld, for at
      også Jesu Liv må åbenbares i vort dødelige Kød.
 12.  Således er Døden virksom i os, men Livet i eder!

 13.  Men efterdi vi have den samme Troens Ånd, som der er skrevet:
      "Jeg troede, derfor talte jeg," så tro også vi, og derfor tale
      vi også,
 14.  idet vi vide, at han, som oprejste den Herre Jesus, skal også
      oprejse os med Jesus og fremstille os tillige med eder.
 15.  Thi det sker alt sammen for eders Skyld, for at Nåden må vokse
      ved at nå til flere, og til Guds Ære forøge Taksigelsen.
 16.  Derfor tabe vi ikke Modet; men om også vort udvortes Menneske
      fortæres, fornyes dog vort indvortes Dag for Dag.
 17.  Thi vor Trængsel, som er stakket og let, virker for os over al
      Måde og Mål en evig Vægt af Herlighed,
 18.  idet vi ikke se på de synlige Ting, men på de usynlige; thi de
      synlige ere timelige, men de usynlige ere evige.

2.Korinterne 5

  1.  Thi vi vide, at dersom vor jordiske Teltbolig nedbrydes, have vi
      en Bygning fra Gud, en Bolig, som ikke er gjort med Hænder, en
      evig i Himlene.
  2.  Ja, også i denne sukke vi, længselsfulde efter at overklædes med
      vor Bolig fra Himmelen,
  3.  så sandt vi da som iklædte ikke skulle findes nøgne.
  4.  Ja, vi, som ere i dette Telt, sukke; besværede, efterdi vi ikke
      ville afklædes, men overklædes, for at det dødelige kan blive
      opslugt af Livet.
  5.  Men den, som har sat os i Stand just til dette, er Gud, som gav
      os Åndens Pant.
  6.  Derfor ere vi altid frimodige og vide, at medens vi ere hjemme i
      Legemet, ere vi borte fra Herren
  7.  thi i Tro vandre vi, ikke i Beskuelse
  8.  ja, vi ere frimodige og have snarere Lyst til at vandre bort fra
      Legemet og være hjemme hos Herren.
  9.  Derfor sætte vi også vor Ære i, hvad enten vi ere hjemme eller
      borte, at være ham velbehagelige.
 10.  Thi vi skulle alle åbenbares for Kristi Domstol, for at hver kan
      få igen, hvad der ved Legemet er gjort, efter det, som han har
      øvet, enten godt eller ondt.

 11.  Efterdi vi da kende Frygten for Herren, søge vi at vinde
      Mennesker; men for Gud ere vi åbenbare; ja, jeg håber, at vi
      også ere åbenbare for eders Samvittigheder.
 12.  Ikke anbefale vi atter os selv til eder; men vi give eder
      Anledning til at rose eder af os, for at I, kunne have noget at
      svare dem, som rose sig af det udvortes og ikke af Hjertet.
 13.  Thi når vi "bleve afsindige"; var det for Guds Skyld, og når vi
      ere besindige, er det for eders Skyld.
 14.  Thi Kristi Kærlighed tvinger os,
 15.  idet vi have sluttet således: Een er død for alle, altså ere de
      alle døde; og han døde for alle, for at de levende ikke mere
      skulle leve for sig selv, men for ham, som er død og oprejst for
      dem.
 16.  Således vide vi fra nu af ikke af nogen efter Kødet; om vi også
      have kendt Kristus efter Kødet, gøre vi det dog ikke mere nu.
 17.  Derfor, om nogen er i Kristus, da er han en ny Skabning; det
      gamle er forbigangent, se, det er blevet nyt!
 18.  Men alt dette er fra Gud, som forligte os med sig selv ved
      Kristus og gav os Forligelsens Tjeneste,
 19.  efterdi det jo var Gud, som i Kristus forligte Verden med sig
      selv, idet han ikke tilregner dem deres Overtrædelser og har
      nedlagt Forligelsens Ord i os.
 20.  Vi ere altså Sendebud i Kristi Sted, som om Gud formaner ved os;
      vi bede i Kristi Sted: Bliver forligte med Gud!
 21.  Den, som ikke kendte Synd, har han gjort til Synd for os, for at
      vi skulle blive Guds Retfærdighed i ham.

2.Korinterne 6

  1.  Men som Medarbejdere formane vi også til, at I ikke forgæves må
      have modtaget Guds Nåde;
  2.  (han siger jo: "På en behagelig Tid bønhørte jeg dig, og på en
      Frelsens Dag hjalp jeg dig." Se, nu er det en velbehagelig Tid,
      se, nu er det en Frelsens Dag;)
  3.  og vi give ikke i nogen Ting noget Anstød, for at Tjenesten ikke
      skal blive lastet;
  4.  men i alting anbefale vi som Guds Tjenere os selv ved stor
      Udholdenhed i Trængsler, i Nød, i Angster,
  5.  under Slag, i Fængsler, under Oprør, under Besværligheder, i
      Nattevågen, i Faste,
  6.  ved Renhed, ved Kundskab, ved Langmodighed, ved Velvillighed,
      ved den Helligånd, ved uskrømtet Kærlighed,
  7.  ved Sandheds Ord, ved Guds Kraft, ved Retfærdighedens Våben både
      til Angreb og Forsvar;
  8.  ved Ære og Vanære, ved ondt Rygte og godt Rygte; som Forførere
      og dog sanddru;
  9.  som ukendte og dog velkendte; som døende, og se, vi leve; som
      de, der tugtes, dog ikke til Døde;
 10.  som bedrøvede, dog altid glade; som fattige, der dog gøre mange
      rige; som de, der intet have, og dog eje alt.
 11.  Vor Mund er opladt over for eder, Korinthiere! vort Hjerte er
      udvidet.
 12.  I have ikke snæver Plads i os, men der er snæver Plads i eders
      Hjerter.
 13.  Men ligeså til Gengæld (jeg taler som til mine Børn), må også I
      udvide eders Hjerter!

 14.  Drager ikke i ulige Åg med vantro; thi hvad Fællesskab har
      Retfærdighed og Lovløshed? eller hvad Samfund har Lys med Mørke?
 15.  Hvad Samklang er der mellem Kristus og Belial? eller hvad
      Delagtighed har en troende med en vantro?
 16.  Hvad Samstemning har Guds Tempel med Afguder? Thi vi ere den
      levende Guds Tempel, ligesom Gud har sagt: "Jeg vil bo og vandre
      iblandt dem, og jeg vil være deres Gud, og de skulle være mit
      Folk."
 17.  "Derfor går ud fra dem og udskiller eder fra dem, siger Herren,
      og rører ikke noget urent; og jeg vil antage mig eder,"
 18.  "og jeg vil være eders Fader, og I skulle være mine Sønner og
      Døtre, siger Herren, den Almægtige."  (Kap. 7.) 1 Derfor,
      efterdi vi have disse Forjættelser, I elskede! så lader os rense
      os selv fra al Kødets og Åndens Besmittelse, så vi gennemføre
      Hellighed i Guds Frygt!

2.Korinterne 7
  2.  Giver os Rum; ingen have vi gjort Uret, ingen ødelagt, ingen
      bedraget.
  3.  Jeg siger det ikke for at fælde Dom; jeg har jo sagt tilforn, at
      I ere i vore Hjerter, så at vi dø sammen og leve sammen.
  4.  Jeg har stor Frimodighed over for eder; jeg roser mig meget af
      eder, jeg er fuld af Trøst, jeg strømmer over af Glæde under al
      vor Trængsel.
  5.  Thi også da vi kom til Makedonien, havde vort Kød ingen Ro, men
      vi trængtes på alle Måder: udadtil Kampe, indadtil Angster.
  6.  Men han, som trøster de nedbøjede, Gud, han trøstede os ved
      Titus's Komme;
  7.  dog ikke alene ved hans Komme, men også ved den Trøst, hvormed
      han var bleven trøstet over eder, idet han fortalte os om eders
      Længsel, eders Gråd, eders Nidkærhed for mig, så at jeg glædede
      mig end mere.

  8.  Thi om jeg end har bedrøvet eder ved Brevet, fortryder jeg det
      ikke.  Om jeg også har fortrudt det, - jeg ser jo, at hint Brev,
      ihvorvel kun til en Tid, har bedrøvet eder, -
  9.  så glæder jeg mig nu, ikke over, at I bleve bedrøvede, men over,
      at I bleve bedrøvede til Omvendelse; thi I bleve bedrøvede efter
      Guds Sind, for at I ikke i nogen Måde skulde lide Skade af os.
 10.  Thi den Bedrøvelse, der er efter Guds Sind, virker Omvendelse
      til Frelse, som ikke fortrydes; men Verdens Bedrøvelse virker
      Død.
 11.  Thi se, just dette, at I bleve bedrøvede efter Guds Sind, hvor
      stor en Iver virkede det ikke hos eder, ja Forsvar, ja Harme, ja
      Frygt, ja Længsel, ja Nidkærhed, ja Straf! På enhver Måde
      beviste I, at I selv vare rene i den Sag.
 12.  Altså, når jeg skrev til eder, var det ikke for hans Skyld, som
      gjorde Uret, ikke heller for hans Skyld, som led Uret, men for
      at eders Iver for os skulde blive åbenbar hos eder for Guds
      Åsyn.

 13.  Derfor ere vi blevne trøstede. Men til vor Trøst kom end
      yderligere Glæden over Titus's Glæde, fordi hans Ånd har fået
      Vederkvægelse fra eder alle.
 14.  Thi i hvad jeg end har rost mig af eder for ham, er jeg ikke
      bleven til Skamme; men ligesom vi i alle Ting have talt Sandhed
      til eder, således er også vor Ros for Titus bleven Sandhed.
 15.  Og hans Hjerte drages inderligere til eder, når han mindes
      Lydigheden hos eder alle,hvorledes I modtoge ham med Frygt og
      Bæven.
 16.  Jeg glæder mig over, at jeg i alt kan lide på eder.

2.Korinterne 8

  1.  Men vi kundgøre eder, Brødre! den Guds Nåde, som er given i
      Makedoniens Menigheder,
  2.  at under megen Trængsels Prøvelse har deres overstrømmende Glæde
      og deres dybe Fattigdom strømmet over i deres Gavmildheds
      Rigdom.
  3.  Thi efter Evne (det vidner jeg) gave de, ja, over Evne af egen
      Drift,
  4.  idet de med megen Overtalelse bade os om den Nåde at måtte tage
      Del i Hjælpen til de hellige,
  5.  og ikke alene som vi havde håbet, men sig selv gav de først og
      fremmest til Herren og så til os, ved Guds Villie,
  6.  så at vi opfordrede Titus til, ligesom han forhen havde begyndt,
      således også til at tilendebringe hos eder også denne Gave.
  7.  Men ligesom I ere rige i alt, i Tro og Tale og Erkendelse og al
      Iver og i eders Kærlighed til os: måtte I da være rige også i
      denne Gave!
  8.  Jeg siger det ikke som en Befaling, men for ved andres Iver at
      prøve også eders Kærligheds Ægthed.
  9.  I kende jo vor Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde, at han for eders Skyld
      blev fattig, da han var rig, for at I ved hans Fattigdom skulde
      blive rige.
 10.  Og jeg giver min Mening herom til Kende; thi dette er eder
      gavnligt, I, som jo i Fjor vare de første til at begynde, ikke
      alene med Gerningen, men endogså med Villien dertil.
 11.  Men fuldbringer da nu også Gerningen, for at, ligesom I vare
      redebonne til at ville, I også må fuldbringe det efter eders
      Evne.
 12.  Thi når Redebonheden er til Stede, da er den velbehagelig efter,
      hvad den evner, ikke efter, hvad den ikke evner.
 13.  Det er nemlig ikke Meningen, at andre skulle have Lettelse og I
      Trængsel; nej, det skal være ligeligt. Nu for Tiden må eders
      Overflod komme hines Trang til Hjælp,
 14.  for at også hines Overflod kan komme eders Trang til Hjælp, for
      at der kan blive Ligelighed,
 15.  som der er skrevet: "Den, som sankede meget, fik ikke for meget,
      og den, som sankede lidet, fik ikke for lidt."

 16.  Men Gud ske Tak, som giver den samme Iver for eder i Titus's
      Hjerte!
 17.  Thi vel har han modtaget min Opfordring; men da han er så ivrig,
      så er det af egen Drift, at han rejser til eder.
 18.  Og sammen med ham sende vi den Broder, hvis Ros i Evangeliet går
      igennem alle Menighederne,
 19.  og ikke det alene, men han er også udvalgt af Menighederne til
      at rejse med os med denne Gave, som besørges af os, for at
      fremme selve Herrens Ære og vor Redebonhed,
 20.  idet vi undgå dette, at nogen skulde kunne laste os i Anledning
      af denne rige Hjælp, som besørges af os;
 21.  thi vi lægge Vind på, hvad der er godt ikke alene i Herrens, men
      også i Menneskers Øjne.
 22.  Men sammen med dem sende vi vor Broder, hvis Iver vi ofte i
      mange Måder have prøvet, men som nu er langt ivrigere på Grund
      af sin støre Tillid til eder.
 23.  Hvad Titus angår, da er han min Fælle og Medarbejder hos eder,
      og hvad vore Brødre angår, da ere de Menighedsudsendinge, Kristi
      Ære.
 24.  Så giver dem da for Menighedernes Åsyn Beviset på eders
      Kærlighed og for det, vi have rost eder for.

2.Korinterne 9

  1.  Thi om Hjælpen til de hellige er det overflødigt at skrive til
      eder;
  2.  jeg kend eders Redebonhed, for hvilken jeg roser mig af eder hos
      Makedonierne, at nemlig Akaja alt fra i Fjor har været beredt;
      og eders Nidkærhed æggede de fleste.
  3.  Men jeg sender Brødrene, for at vor Ros over eder i dette Stykke
      ikke skal vise sig tom, og for at I.som jeg sagde, må være
      beredte.
  4.  for at ikke, når der kommer Makedoniere med mig, og de finder
      eder uforberedte, vi (for ej at sige I) da skulle blive til
      Skamme med denne Tillidsfuldhed.
  5.  Derfor har jeg anset det for nødvendigt at opfordre Brødrene til
      at gå i Forvejen til eder og forud bringe eders tidligere lovede
      Velsignelse i Stand, for at den kan være rede som Velsignelse og
      ikke som Karrighed.
  6.  Men dette siger jeg: Den, som sår sparsomt, skal også høste
      sparsomt, og den, som sår med Velsignelser, skal også høste med
      Velsignelser.
  7.  Enhver give, efter som han har sat sig for i sit Hjerte, ikke
      fortrædeligt eller af Tvang; thi Gud elsker en glad Giver.
  8.  Men Gud er mægtig til at lade al Nåde rigeligt tilflyde eder,
      for at I i alting altid kunne have til fuld Tilfredshed og have
      rigeligt til al god Gerning,
  9.  som der er skrevet: "Han spredte ud, han gav de fattige, hans
      Retfærdighed bliver til evig Tid."
 10.  Men han, som giver "Sædemanden Sæd og Brød til at spise," han
      vil også skænke og mangfoldiggøre eders Udsæd og give eders
      Retfærdigheds Frugter Vækst,
 11.  så I blive rige i alle Måder til al Gavmildhed, hvilken igennem
      os virker Taksigelse til Gud.
 12.  Thi denne Offertjenestes Ydelse ikke alene afhjælper de helliges
      Trang, men giver også et Overskud ved manges Taksigelser til
      Gud,
 13.  når de ved det prøvede Sind, som denne Ydelse viser, bringes til
      at prise Gud for Lydigheden i eders Bekendelse til Kristi
      Evangelium og for Oprigtigheden i eders Samfund med dem og med
      alle,
 14.  også ved deres Bøn for eder, idet de længes efter eder på Grund
      af Guds overvættes Nåde imod eder.
 15.  Gud ske Tak for hans uudsigelige Gave!

2.Korinterne 10

  1.  Men jeg selv, Paulus, formaner eder ved Kristi Sagtmodighed og
      Mildhed, jeg, som, "når I se derpå, er ydmyg iblandt eder, men
      fraværende er modig over for eder",
  2.  ja, jeg beder eder om ikke nærværende at skulle være modig med
      den Tillidsfuldhed, hvormed jeg agter at træde dristigt op imod
      nogle, som anse os for at vandre efter Kødet.
  3.  Thi om vi end vandre i Kødet, så stride vi dog ikke efter Kødet;
  4.  thi vore Stridsvåben er ikke kødelige, men mægtige for Gud til
      Fæstningers Nedbrydelse,
  5.  idet vi nedbryde Tankebygninger og al Højhed, som rejser sig
      imod Erkendelsen af Gud, og tage enhver Tanke til Fange til
      Lydighed imod Kristus
  6.  og ere rede til at straffe al Ulydighed, når eders Lydighed er
      bleven fuldkommen.
  7.  Se I på det udvortes? Dersom nogen trøster sig til selv at høre
      Kristus til, da slutte han igen fra sig selv, at ligesom han
      hører Kristus til, således gøre vi det også.
  8.  Ja, dersom jeg endog vilde rose mig noget mere af vor Magt, som
      Herren gav os til eders Opbyggelse og ikke til eders
      Nedbrydelse, skal jeg dog ikke blive til Skamme,
  9.  for at jeg ikke skal synes at ville skræmme eder ved mine Breve;
 10.  thi Brevene, siger man, ere vægtige og stærke, men hans
      legemlige Nærværelse er svag, og hans Tale intet værd.
 11.  En sådan betænke, at således som vi fraværende ere med Ord ved
      Breve, således ville vi, også nærværende være i Gerning.

 12.  Thi vi driste os ikke til at regne os iblandt eller sammenligne
      os med somme af dem, der anbefale sig selv; men selv indse de
      ikke, at de måle sig med sig selv og sammenligne sig med sig
      selv.
 13.  Vi derimod ville ikke rose os ud i det umålelige, men efter
      Målet af den Grænselinie, som Gud har tildelt os som Mål, at nå
      også til eder.
 14.  Thi vi strække os ikke for vidt, som om vi ikke nåede til eder;
      vi ere jo komne også indtil eder i Kristi Evangelium,
 15.  så vi ikke rose os ud i det umålelige af andres Arbejder, men
      have det Håb, at, når eders Tro vokser, ville vi hos eder blive
      store, efter vor Grænselinie, så vi kunne komme langt videre
 16.  og forkynde Evangeliet i Landene hinsides eder, men ikke rose os
      inden for en andens Grænselinie af det allerede fuldførte.
 17.  Men den, som roser sig, rose sig af Herren!
 18.  Thi ikke den, der anbefaler sig selv, står Prøve, men den, hvem
      Herren anbefaler.

2.Korinterne 11

  1.  Gid I vilde finde eder i en Smule Dårskab af mig! Dog, I gør det
      Jo nok.
  2.  Thi jeg er nidkær for eder med Guds Nidkærhed; jeg har jo
      trolovet eder med een Mand for at fremstille en ren Jomfru for
      Kristus.
  3.  Men jeg frygter for, at ligesom Slangen bedrog Eva ved sin
      Træskhed, således skulle eders Tanker fordærves og miste det
      oprigtige Sindelag over for Kristus.
  4.  Thi dersom nogen kommer og prædiker en anden Jesus, som vi ikke
      prædikede, eller I få en anderledes Ånd, som I ikke fik, eller
      et anderledes Evangelium, som I ikke modtoge, da vilde I kønt
      finde eder deri.
  5.  Thi jeg mener ikke at stå tilbage i noget for de såre store
      Apostle.
  6.  Er jeg end ulærd i Tale, så er jeg det dog ikke i Kundskab;
      tværtimod på enhver Måde have vi lagt den for Dagen for eder i
      alle Stykker.

  7.  Eller gjorde jeg Synd i at fornedre mig selv, for at I skulde
      ophøjes, idet jeg forkyndte eder Guds Evangelium for intet?
  8.  Andre Menigheder plyndrede jeg, idet jeg tog Sold af dem for at
      tjene eder, og medens jeg var nærværende hos eder og kom i
      Trang, faldt jeg ingen til Byrde;
  9.  thi min Trang afhjalp Brødrene, da de kom fra Makedonien, og i
      alt har jeg holdt og vil jeg holde mig uden Tynge for eder.
 10.  Så vist som Kristi Sandhed er i mig, skal denne Ros ikke
      fratages mig i Akajas Egne.
 11.  Hvorfor? mon fordi jeg ikke elsker eder? Gud ved det.
 12.  Men hvad jeg gør, det vil jeg fremdeles gøre, for at jeg kan
      afskære dem Lejligheden, som søge en Lejlighed, til at findes os
      lige i det, hvoraf de rose sig.
 13.  Thi sådanne ere falske Apostle, svigefulde Arbejdere, som påtage
      sig Skikkelse af Kristi Apostle.
 14.  Og det er intet Under; thi Satan selv påtager sig Skikkelse af
      en Lysets Engel.
 15.  Derfor er det ikke noget stort, om også hans Tjenere påtage sig
      Skikkelse som Retfærdigheds Tjenere; men deres Ende skal være
      efter deres Gerninger.

 16.  Atter siger jeg: Ingen må agte mig for en Dåre; men hvis så skal
      være, så tåler mig endog som en Dåre, for at også jeg kan rose
      mig en Smule.
 17.  Hvad jeg nu taler, taler jeg ikke efter Herrens Sind, men som i
      Dårskab, idet jeg så tillidsfuldt roser mig.
 18.  Efterdi mange rose sig med Hensyn til Kødet, vil også jeg rose
      mig.
 19.  Gerne finde I eder jo i Dårerne, efterdi I ere kloge.
 20.  I finde eder jo i, om nogen gør eder til Trælle, om nogen æder
      eder op, om nogen tager til sig, om nogen ophøjer sig, om nogen
      slår eder i Ansigtet.
 21.  Med Skamfuldhed siger jeg det, efterdi vi have været svage; men
      hvad end nogen trodser på (jeg taler i Dårskab), derpå trodser
      også jeg.
 22.  Ere de Hebræere? Jeg også. Ere de Israeliter? Jeg også. Ere de
      Abrahams Sæd? Jeg også.
 23.  Ere de Kristi Tjenere? Jeg taler i Vanvid: jeg er det mere. Jeg
      har lidt langt flere Besværligheder, fået langt flere Slag,
      været hyppigt i Fængsel, ofte i Dødsfare.
 24.  Af Jøder har jeg fem Gange fået fyrretyve Slag mindre end eet.
 25.  Tre Gange er jeg bleven pisket, een Gang stenet, tre Gange har
      jeg lidt Skibbrud, et Døgn har jeg tilbragt på Dybet;
 26.  ofte på Rejser, i Farer fra Floder, i Farer iblandt Røvere, i
      Farer fra mit Folk, i Farer fra Hedninger, i Farer i By, i Farer
      i Ørken, i Farer på Havet, i Farer iblandt falske Brødre;
 27.  i Møje og Anstrengelse, ofte i Nattevågen, i Hunger og Tørst,
      ofte i Faste, i Kulde og Nøgenhed;
 28.  foruden hvad der kommer til, mit daglige Overløb, Bekymringen
      for alle Menighederne.
 29.  Hvem er skrøbelig, uden at også jeg er det? hvem bliver
      forarget, uden at det brænder i mig?
 30.  Dersom jeg skal rose mig, da vil jeg rose mig af min
      Magtesløshed.
 31.  Gud og den Herres Jesu Fader, som er højlovet i Evighed, ved, at
      jeg ikke lyver.
 32.  I Damaskus holdt Kong Aretas's Statholder Damaskenernes Stad
      bevogtet for at gribe mig;
 33.  men jeg blev igennem en Luge firet ned over Muren i en Kurv og
      undflyede af hans Hænder.

2.Korinterne 12

  1.  Rose mig må jeg Gavnligt er det vel ikke; men jeg vil komme til
      Syner og Åbenbarelser fra Herren.
  2.  Jeg kender et Menneske i Kristus, som for fjorten År siden om
      han var i Legemet, det ved jeg ikke, eller uden for Legemet, det
      ved jeg ikke, Gud ved det blev bortrykket indtil den tredje
      Himmel.
  3.  Og jeg ved, at dette Menneske (om han var i Legemet, eller uden
      Legemet, det ved jeg ikke, Gud ved det),
  4.  at han blev bortrykket ind i Paradiset, og hørte uudsigelige
      Ord, som det ikke er et Menneske tilladt at udtale.
  5.  Af en sådan vil jeg rose mig; men af mig selv vil jeg ikke rose
      mig, uden af min Magtesløshed.
  6.  Thi vel bliver jeg ikke en Dåre, om jeg vilde rose mig; thi det
      vil være Sandhed, jeg siger; men jeg afholder mig derfra, for at
      ingen skal tænke højere om mig, end hvad han ser mig være, eller
      hvad han hører af mig.
  7.  Og for at jeg ikke skal hovmode mig af de høje Åbenbarelser,
      blev der givet mig en Torn i Kødet, en Satans Engel, for at han
      skulde slå mig i Ansigtet, for at jeg ikke skulde hovmode mig.
  8.  Om denne bad jeg Herren tre Gange, at han måtte vige fra mig;
  9.  og han har sagt mig: "Min Nåde er dig nok; thi Kraften
      fuldkommes i Magtesløshed." Allerhelst vil jeg derfor rose mig
      af min Magtesløshed, for at Kristi Kraft kan tage Bolig i mig.
 10.  Derfor er jeg veltilfreds under Magtesløshed, under Overlast,
      under Nød, under Forfølgelser, under Angster for Kristi Skyld;
      thi når jeg er magtesløs, da er jeg stærk.

 11.  Jeg er bleven en Dåre. I tvang mig dertil. Jeg burde jo
      anbefales af eder; thi jeg har ikke stået tilbage i noget for de
      såre store Apostle, om jeg end, intet er.
 12.  En Apostels Tegn bleve jo udførte, iblandt eder under
      Udholdenhed, ved Tegn og Undere og kraftige Gerninger.
 13.  Thi hvad er det vel, hvori I bleve stillede ringere end de andre
      Menigheder; uden at jeg ikke selv faldt eder til Byrde? Tilgiver
      mig denne Uret!
 14.  Se, dette er nu tredje Gang, jeg står rede til at komme til
      eder, og jeg vil ikke falde til Byrde; thi jeg søger ikke eders
      Gods, men eder selv, thi Børnene skulle ikke samle sammen til
      Forældrene, men Forældrene til Børnene.
 15.  Men jeg vil med Glæde gøre Opofrelser ja, opofres for eders
      Sjæle.  Mon jeg, når jeg elsker eder højere, elskes mindre?
 16.  Men lad så være, at jeg ikke har været eder til Byrde, men jeg
      var træsk og fangede eder med List!
 17.  Har jeg da gjort mig Fordel af eder ved nogen af dem, jeg har
      sendt til eder?
 18.  Jeg opfordrede Titus og sendte Broderen med; har Titus da gjort
      sig nogen Fordel af eder? Vandrede vi ikke i den samme Ånd, i de
      samme Fodspor?

 19.  Alt længe have I ment, at vi forsvare os for eder. Nej, for Guds
      Åsyn tale vi i Kristus. Men det sker alt sammen, I elskede, for
      eders Opbyggelses Skyld.
 20.  Thi jeg frygter for, at, når jeg kommer, jeg da måske ikke skal
      finde eder sådanne, som jeg ønsker, og at jeg skal findes af
      eder sådan, som I ikke ønske; at der skal være Kiv, Nid,
      Hidsighed, Rænker, Bagtalelser, Øretuderier, Opblæsthed,
      Klammerier,
 21.  at min Gud, når jeg kommer igen, skal ydmyge mig i Anledning af
      eder, og jeg skal sørge over mange af dem, som forhen have
      syndet og ikke have omvendt sig fra den Urenhed og Utugt og
      Uterlighed, som de bedreve.

2.Korinterne 13

  1.  Det er nu tredje Gang, jeg kommer til eder. På to og tre Vidners
      Mund skal enhver Sag stå fast.
  2.  Jeg har sagt det forud og siger det forud, ligesom da jeg anden
      Gang var nærværende, således også nu fraværende til dem, som
      forhen have syndet, og til alle de øvrige, at, om jeg kommer
      igen, vil jeg ikke skåne,
  3.  efterdi I fordre Bevis på, at Kristus taler i mig, han, som ikke
      er magtesløs over for eder, men er stærk iblandt eder.
  4.  Thi vel blev han korsfæstet i Magtesløshed, men han lever ved
      Guds Kraft; også vi ere svage i ham, men vi skulle leve med ham
      ved Guds Kraft over for eder.
  5.  Ransager eder selv, om I ere i Troen; prøver eder selv! Eller
      erkende I ikke om eder selv, at Jesus Kristus er i eder? ellers
      ere I udygtige.
  6.  Men jeg håber, at I skulle kende, at vi ere ikke udygtige.
  7.  Men vi bede til Gud om, at I intet ondt må gøre; ikke for at vi
      må vise os dygtige, men for at I må gøre det gode, vi derimod
      stå som udygtige.
  8.  Thi vi formå ikke noget imod Sandheden, men for Sandheden.
  9.  Thi vi glæde os, når vi ere magtesløse, og I ere stærke; dette
      ønske vi også, at I må blive fuldkommengjorte.
 10.  Derfor skriver jeg dette fraværende, for at jeg ikke nærværende
      skal bruge Strenghed, efter den Magt, som Herren har givet mig
      til Opbyggelse, og ikke til Nedbrydelse.

 11.  I øvrigt, Brødre! glæder eder, bliver fuldkommengjorte, lader
      eder formane, værer enige, værer fredsommelige; og Kærlighedens
      og Fredens Gud skal være med eder.
 12.  Hilser hverandre med et helligt Kys! Alle de hellige hilse eder.
 13.  Den Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde og Guds Kærlighed og den Helligånds
      Samfund være med eder alle!


Galaterne

Galaterne 1

  1.  Paulus, Apostel, ikke af Mennesker, ikke heller ved noget
      Menneske, men ved Jesus Kristus og Gud Fader, som oprejste ham
      fra de døde,
  2.  og alle Brødrene, som ere med mig, til Menighederne i Galatien:
  3.  Nåde være med eder og Fred fra Gud Fader og vor Herre Jesus
      Kristus,
  4.  som gav sig selv for vore Synder, for at han kunde udfri os af
      den nærværende onde Verden, efter vor Guds og Faders Villie,
  5.  ham være Æren i Evigheders Evighed! Amen.

  6.  Jeg undrer mig over, at I så snart lade eder føre bort fra ham,
      som kaldte eder til Kristi Nåde, hen til et anderledes
      Evangelium;
  7.  hvilket dog ikke er et andet, men det er kun nogle, som forvirre
      eder. og ville vende op og ned på Kristi Evangelium.
  8.  Men selv om vi eller en Engel fra Himmelen forkynder eder
      Evangeliet anderledes; end vi have forkyndt eder det, han være
      en Forbandelse!
  9.  Som vi før have sagt, så siger jeg nu igen: Dersom nogen
      forkynder eder Evangeliet anderledes, end I have modtaget det,
      han være en Forbandelse!
 10.  Taler jeg da nu Mennesker til Villie, eller Gud? eller søger jeg
      at behage Mennesker? Dersom jeg endnu vilde behage Mennesker, da
      var jeg ikke en Kristi Tjener.

 11.  Men jeg kundgør eder, Brødre! at det Evangelium, som er forkyndt
      af mig, er ikke Menneskeværk;
 12.  thi heller ikke jeg har modtaget det eller er bleven undervist
      derom af noget Menneske, men ved Åbenbarelse at Jesus Kristus.
 13.  I have jo hørt om min Vandel forhen i Jødedommen, at jeg over al
      Måde forfulgte Guds Menighed og søgte at udrydde den.
 14.  Og jeg gik videre i Jødedommen end mange jævnaldrende i mit
      Folk, idet jeg var langt mere nidkær for mine fædrene
      Overleveringer.
 15.  Men da det behagede Gud, som fra min Moders Liv havde udtaget
      mig og havde kaldet mig ved sin Nåde,
 16.  at åbenbare sin Søn i mig, for at jeg skulde forkynde Evangeliet
      om ham iblandt Hedningerne: da spurgte jeg straks ikke Kød og
      Blod til Råds,
 17.  drog heller ikke op til Jerusalem, til dem, som før mig vare
      Apostle, men jeg drog bort til Arabien og vendte atter tilbage
      til Damaskus.
 18.  Senere, tre År efter, drog jeg op til Jerusalem for at blive
      kendt med Kefas og blev hos ham i femten Dage.
 19.  Men nogen anden af Apostlene så jeg ikke, men kun Jakob, Herrens
      Broder.
 20.  Men hvad jeg skriver til eder - se, for Guds Åsyn vidner jeg, at
      jeg ikke lyver.
 21.  Derefter kom jeg til Syriens og Kilikiens Egne.
 22.  Men personlig var jeg ukendt for Judæas Menigheder i Kristus;
 23.  de hørte kun sige: Han, som forhen forfulgte os, forkynder nu
      Evangeliet om den Tro, som han forhen vilde udrydde;
 24.  og de priste Gud for mig.

Galaterne 2

  1.  Senere, efter fjorten Års Forløb, drog jeg atter op til
      Jerusalem med Brnabas og tog også Titus med.
  2.  Men jeg drog op ifølge en Åbenbaring og forelagde dem, men
      særskilt de ansete, det Evangelium, som jeg prædiker iblandt
      Hedningerne, - om jeg vel løber eller har løbet forgæves.
  3.  Men end ikke min Ledsager, Titus, som var en Græker, blev
      tvungen til at omskæres,
  4.  nemlig for de indsnegne falske Brødres Skyld, som jo havde
      listet sig ind for at lure på vor Frihed, som vi have i Kristus
      Jesus, for at de kunde gøre os til Trælle.
  5.  For dem vege vi end ikke et Øjeblik i Eftergivenhed, for at
      Evangeliets Sandhed måtte blive varig hos eder.
  6.  Men fra deres Side, som ansås for at være noget, (hvordan de
      fordum vare, er mig uden Forskel; Gud ser ikke på et Menneskes
      Person;) - over for mig nemlig havde de ansete intet at tilføje.
  7.  Men tværtimod, da de så, at jeg har fået Evangeliet til de
      uomskårne betroet, ligesom Peter til de omskårne,
  8.  (thi han, som gav Peter Kraft til Apostelgerning for de
      omskårne, gav også mig Kaft dertil for Hedningerne;)
  9.  og da de lærte den mig givne Nåde at kende, gave Jakob og Kefas
      og Johannes, som ansås for at være Søjler, mig og Barnabas
      Samfundshånd for at vi skulde gå til Hedningerne og de til de
      omskårne;
 10.  kun at vi skulde komme de fattige i Hu, hvad jeg også just har
      bestræbt mig for at gøre.

 11.  Men da Kefas kom til Antiokia, trådte jeg op imod ham for hans
      åbne Øjne, thi domfældt var han.
 12.  Thi førend der kom nogle fra Jakob, spiste han sammen med
      Hedningerne; men da de kom, trak han sig tilbage og skilte sig
      fra dem af Frygt for dem af Omskærelsen.
 13.  Og med ham hyklede også de øvrige Jøder, så at endog Barnabas
      blev dragen med af deres Hykleri.
 14.  Men da jeg så, at de ikke vandrede rettelig efter Evangeliets
      Sandhed, sagde jeg til Kefas i alles Påhør: Når du, som er en
      Jøde, lever på hedensk og ikke på jødisk Vis, hvor kan du da
      tvinge Hedningerne til at opføre sig som Jøder?
 15.  Vi ere af Natur Jøder og ikke Syndere af hedensk Byrd;
 16.  men da vi vide, at et Menneske ikke bliver retfærdiggjort af
      Lovens Gerninger, men kun ved Tro på Jesus Kristus, så have også
      vi troet på Kristus Jesus, for at vi måtte blive retfærdiggjorte
      al Tro på Kristus og ikke af Lovens Gerninger; thi af Lovens
      Geringer skal intet Kød blive retfærdiggjort.
 17.  Men når vi, idet vi søgte at blive retfærdiggjorte i Kristus,
      også selv fandtes at være Syndere, så er jo Kristus en Tjener
      for Synd? Det være langtfra!
 18.  når jeg nemlig igen bygger det op, som jeg nedbrød, da viser jeg
      mig selv som Overtræder.
 19.  Thi jeg er ved Loven død fra Loven, for at jeg skal leve for
      Gud.
 20.  Med Kristus er jeg korsfæstet, og det er ikke mere mig, der
      lever, men Kristus lever i mig; men hvad jeg nu lever, i Kødet,
      det lever jeg i Troen, på Guds Søn, som elskede mig og gav sig
      selv hen for mig.
 21.  Jeg ophæver ikke Guds Nåde; thi er der Retfærdighed ved Loven,
      da er jo Kristus død forgæves.

Galaterne 3

  1.  O, I uforstandige Galatere! hvem har fortryllet eder, I, hvem
      Jesus Kristus blev malet for Øje som korsfæstet?
  2.  Kun dette vil jeg vide af eder: Var det ved Lovens Gerninger, I
      modtoge Ånden, eller ved i Tro at høre?
  3.  Ere I så uforstandige? ville I, som begyndte i Ånd, nu ende i
      Kød?
  4.  Have I da prøvet så meget forgæves? hvis det da virkelig er
      forgæves!
  5.  Mon da han, som meddeler eder Ånden og virker kraftige Gerninger
      iblandt eder, gør dette ved Lovens Gerninger eller ved, at I
      høre i Tro?
  6.  ligesom jo "Abraham troede Gud, og det blev regnet ham til
      Retfærdighed".
  7.  Erkender altså, at de, som ere af Tro, disse ere Abrahams Børn.
  8.  Men da Skriften forudså, at det er af Tro, at Gud retfærdiggør
      Hedningerne, forkyndte den forud Abraham det Evangelium: "I dig
      skulle alle Folkeslagene velsignes",
  9.  så at de, som ere af Tro, velsignes sammen med den troende
      Abraham.

 10.  Thi så mange, som holde sig til Lovens Gerninger, ere under
      Forbandelse; thi der er skrevet: "Forbandet hver den, som ikke
      bliver i alle de Ting, som ere skrevne i Lovens Bog, så han gør
      dem."
 11.  Men at ingen bliver retfærdiggjort for Gud ved Lov, er åbenbart,
      thi "deri retfærdige skal leve af Tro."
 12.  Men Loven beror ikke på Tro; men: "Den, som gør disse Ting, skal
      leve ved dem."
 13.  Kristus har løskøbt os fra Lovens Forbandelse, idet han blev en
      Forbandelse for os (thi der er skrevet: "Forbandet er hver den,
      som hænger på et Træ"),
 14.  for at Abrahams Velsignelse måtte komme til Hedningerne i
      Kristus Jesus, for at vi kunde få Åndens Forjættelse ved Troen.

 15.  Brødre! jeg taler på Menneskevis: Ingen ophæver dog et Menneskes
      stadfæstede Arvepagt eller føjer noget dertil.
 16.  Men Abraham og hans Sæd bleve Forjættelserne tilsagte; der siges
      ikke: "og Sædene", som om mange, men som om eet: "og din Sæd",
      hvilken er Kristus.
 17.  Jeg mener dermed dette: En Pagt, som forud er stadfæstet af Gud,
      kan Loven, som blev til fire Hundrede og tredive År senere, ikke
      gøre ugyldig, så at den skulde gøre Forjættelsen til intet.
 18.  Thi fås Arven ved Lov, da fås den ikke mere ved Forjættelse; men
      til Abraham har Gud skænket den ved Forjættelse.

 19.  Hvad skulde da Loven? Den blev føjet til for Overtrædelsernes
      Skyld (indtil den Sæd kom, hvem Forjættelsen gjaldt), besørget
      ved Engle, ved en Mellemmands Hånd.
 20.  Men en Mellemmand er ikke kun for een Part; Gud derimod er een.
 21.  Er da Loven imod Guds Forjættelser? Det være langtfra! Ja, hvis
      der var givet en Lov, som kunde levendegøre, da var
      Retfærdigheden virkelig af Lov.
 22.  Men Skriften har indesluttet alt under Synd, for at Forjættelsen
      skulde af Tro på Jesus Kristus gives dem, som tro.
 23.  Men førend Troen kom, holdtes vi indelukkede under Lovens
      Bevogtning til den Tro, som skulde åbenbares,
 24.  så at Loven er bleven os en Tugtemester til Kristus, for at vi
      skulde blive retfærdiggjorte af Tro.
 25.  Men efter at Troen er kommen, ere vi ikke mere under
      Tugtemester.
 26.  Thi alle ere I Guds Børn ved Troen på Kristus Jesus.
 27.  Thi I, så mange som bleve døbte til Kristus, have iført eder
      Kristus.
 28.  Her er ikke Jøde eller Græker; her er ikke Træl eller fri; her
      er ikke Mand og Kvinde; thi alle ere I een i Kristus Jesus.
 29.  Men når I høre Kristus til, da ere I jo Abrahams Sæd, Arvinger
      ifølge Forjættelse.

Galaterne 4

  1.  Men jeg siger: Så længe Arvingen er umyndig, er der ingen
      Forskel imellem ham og en Træl, skønt han er Herre over alt
      Godset;
  2.  men han står under Formyndere og Husholdere indtil den af
      Faderen bestemte Tid.
  3.  Således stode også vi, dengang vi vare umyndige, som Trælle
      under Verdens Børnelærdom.
  4.  Men da Tidens Fylde kom, udsendte Gud sin Søn, født af en
      Kvinde, født under Loven,
  5.  for at han skulde løskøbe dem, som vare under Loven, for at vi
      skulde få Sønneudkårelsen.
  6.  Men fordi I ere Sønner, har Gud udsendt i vore Hjerter sin Søns
      Ånd, som råber: Abba, Fader!
  7.  Altså er du ikke længer Træl, men Søn; men er du Søn, da er du
      også Arving ved Gud.

  8.  Dengang derimod, da I ikke kendte Gud, trællede I for de Guder,
      som af Natur ikke ere det.
  9.  Men nu, da I have lært Gud at kende, ja, meget mere ere blevne
      kendte af Gud, hvor kunne I da atter vende tilbage til den svage
      og fattige Børnelærdom, som I atter forfra ville trælle under?
 10.  I tage Vare på Dage og Måneder og Tider og År.
 11.  Jeg frygter for, at jeg måske har arbejdet forgæves på eder.

 12.  Vorder ligesom jeg, thi også jeg er bleven som I, Brødre! jeg
      beder eder. I have ikke gjort mig nogen Uret.
 13.  Men I vide, at det var på Grund af en Kødets Svaghed, at jeg
      første Gang forkyndte Evangeliet for eder;
 14.  og det, som i mit Kød var eder til Fristelse, ringeagtede I ikke
      og afskyede I ikke, men I modtoge mig som en Guds Engel, som
      Kristus Jesus.
 15.  Hvor er da nu eders Saligprisning? Thi jeg giver eder det
      Vidnesbyrd, at, om det havde været muligt, havde I udrevet eders
      Øjne og givet mig dem.
 16.  Så er jeg vel bleven eders Fjende ved at tale Sandhed til eder?
 17.  De ere nidkære for eder, dog ikke for det gode; men de ville
      udelukke eder, for at I skulle være nidkære for dem.
 18.  Men det er godt at vise sig nidkær i det gode til enhver Tid, og
      ikke alene, når jeg er nærværende hos eder.
 19.  Mine Børn, som jeg atter føder med Smerte, indtil Kristus har
      vundet Skikkelse i eder!
 20.  - ja, jeg vilde ønske, at jeg nu var til Stede hos eder og kunde
      omskifte min Røst; thi jeg er rådvild over for eder.

 21.  Siger mig, I, som ville være under Loven, høre I ikke Loven?
 22.  Der er jo skrevet, at Abraham havde to Sønner, en med
      Tjenestekvinden og en med den frie Kvinde.
 23.  Men Tjenestekvindens Søn er avlet efter Kødet, den frie Kvindes
      ved Forjættelsen.
 24.  Dette har en billedlig Betydning. Thi disse Kvinder ere tvende
      Pagter, den ene fra Sinai Bjerg, som føder til Trældom: denne er
      Hagar.
 25.  Thi "Hagar" er Sinai Bjerg i Arabien, men svarer til det
      nuværende Jerusalem; thi det er i Trældom med sine Børn.
 26.  Men Jerusalem heroventil er frit, og hun er vor Moder.
 27.  Thi der er skrevet: "Fryd dig, du ufrugtbare, du, som ikke
      føder!  bryd ud og råb, du, som ikke har Fødselsveer! thi mange
      ere den enliges Børn fremfor hendes, som har Manden."
 28.  Men vi, Brødre! ere Forjættelsens Børn i Lighed med Isak.
 29.  Men ligesom dengang han, som var avlet efter Kødet, forfulgte
      ham, som var avlet efter Ånden, således også nu.
 30.  Men hvad siger Skriften?"Uddriv Tjenestekvinden og hendes Søn;
      thi Tjenestekvindens Søn skal ingenlunde arve med den frie
      Kvindes Søn."
 31.  Derfor, Brødre! ere vi ikke Tjenestekvindens Børn, men den frie
      Kvindes.

Galaterne 5

  1.  Til Friheden har Kristus frigjort os. Så står nu fast, og lader
      eder ikke atter holde under Trældoms Åg!
  2.  Se, jeg, Paulus, siger eder, at dersom I lade eder omskære, vil
      Kristus intet gavne eder.
  3.  Men jeg vidner atter for hvert Menneske, som lader sig omskære,
      at han er skyldig at opfylde hele Loven.
  4.  I ere tabte for Kristus, I, som retfærdiggøres ved Loven; I ere
      faldne ud af Nåden.
  5.  Vi vente jo ved Ånden af Tro Retfærdigheds Håb.
  6.  Thi i Kristus Jesus gælder hverken Omskærelse eller Forhud
      noget, men Tro, som er virksom ved Kærlighed.

  7.  I vare godt på Vej; hvem har hindret eder i at adlyde Sandhed?
  8.  Den Overtalelse kom ikke fra ham, som kaldte eder.
  9.  En liden Surdejg syrer hele Dejgen.
 10.  Jeg har den Tillid til eder i Herren, at I ikke ville mene noget
      andet; men den, som forvirrer eder, skal bære sin Dom, hvem han
      end er.
 11.  Men jeg, Brødre! dersom jeg endnu prædiker Omskærelse, hvor for
      forfølges jeg da endnu? Så er jo Korsets Forargelse gjort til
      intet.
 12.  Gid de endog måtte lemlæste sig selv, de, som forstyrre eder!

 13.  I bleve jo kaldede til Frihed, Brødre! kun at I ikke bruge
      Friheden til en Anledning for Kødet, men værer ved Kærligheden
      hverandres Tjenere!
 14.  Thi hele Loven er opfyldt i eet Ord, i det: "Du skal elske din
      Næste som dig selv."
 15.  Men når I bide og æde hverandre, da ser til, at I ikke fortæres
      af hverandre!

 16.  Men jeg siger: Vandrer efter Ånden, så fuldbyrde I ingenlunde
      Kødets Begæring.
 17.  Thi Kødet begærer imod Ånden, og Ånden imod Kødet; disse stå
      nemlig hinanden imod,for at I ikke skulle gøre, hvad I have Lyst
      til.
 18.  Men når I drives af Ånden, ere I ikke under Loven.
 19.  Men Kødets Gerninger ere åbenbare, såsom: Utugt, Urenhed,
      Uterlighed,
 20.  Afgudsdyrkelse,Trolddom,Fjendskaber, Kiv, Nid, Hidsighed,
      Rænker, Tvedragt, Partier,
 21.  Avind, Drukkenskab, Svir og deslige; hvorom jeg forud siger
      eder, ligesom jeg også før har sagt, at de, som øve sådanne
      Ting, skulle ikke arve Guds Rige.
 22.  Men Åndens Frugt er Kærlighed, Glæde, Fred, Langmodighed,
      Mildhed, Godhed, Trofasthed,
 23.  Sagtmodighed, Afholdenhed Imod sådanne er Loven ikke,
 24.  men de, som høre Kristus Jesus til, have korsfæstet Kødet med
      dets Lidenskaber og Begæringer.
 25.  Når vi leve ved Ånden, da lader os også vandre efter Ånden!
 26.  Lader os ikke have Lyst til tom Ære, så at vi udæske hverandre
      og bære Avind imod hverandre.

Galaterne 6

  1.  Brødre! om også et Menneske bliver overrasket af nogen
      Forsyndelse, da hjælper en sådan til Rette, I åndelige! med
      Sagtmodigheds Ånd, og se til dig selv, at ikke også du bliver
      fristet!
  2.  Bærer hverandres Byrder og opfylder således Kristi Lov!
  3.  Thi når nogen mener, at han er noget, skønt han intet er, da
      bedrager han sig selv.
  4.  Men hver prøve sin egen Gerning, og da skal han have sin Ros i
      Forhold til sig selv alene, og ikke til Næsten;
  5.  thi hver skal bære sin egen Byrde.

  6.  Men den, som undervises i Ordet skal dele alt godt med den, som
      underviser ham.
  7.  Farer ikke vild; Gud lader sig ikke spotte; thi hvad et Menneske
      sår, det skal han også høste.
  8.  Thi den, som sår i sit Kød, skal høste Fordærvelse af Kødet; men
      den, som sår i Ånden, skal høste evigt Liv af Ånden.
  9.  Men når vi gøre det gode, da lader os ikke blive trætte; thi i
      sin Tid skulle vi høste, såfremt vi ikke give tabt.
 10.  Så lader os altså, efter som vi have Lejlighed, gøre det gode
      imod alle, men mest imod Troens egne!

 11.  Ser nu, med hvor store Bogstaver jeg skriver til eder med min
      egen Hånd!
 12.  Alle de, som ville tage sig godt ud i Kødet, de tvinge eder til
      at lade eder omskære, alene for at de ikke skulle forfølges for
      Kristi Kors's Skyld.
 13.  Thi ikke engang de, som lade sig omskære, holde selv Loven; men
      de ville, at I skulle lade eder omskære, for at de kunne rose
      sig af eders Kød.
 14.  Men det være langt fra mig at rose mig uden af vor Herres Jesu
      Kristi Kors,ved hvem Verden er korsfæstet for mig, og jeg for
      Verden.
 15.  Thi hverken Omskærelse eller Forhud er noget, men en ny
      Skabning.
 16.  Og så mange, som vandre efter denne Rettesnor, over dem være
      Fred og Barmhjertighed, og over Guds Israel!

 17.  Herefter volde ingen mig Besvær; thi jeg bærer Jesu Mærketegn på
      mit Legeme:
 18.  Vor Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde være med eders Ånd, Brødre! Amen.


Efeserne

Efeserne 1

  1.  Paulus, Kristi Jesu Apostel ved Guds Villie, til de hellige, som
      ere i Efesus og ere troende i Kristus Jesus:
  2.  Nåde være med eder og Fred fra Gud vor Fader og den Herre Jesus
      Kristus!

  3.  Lovet være Gud og vor Herres Jesu Kristi Fader, som har
      velsignet os med al åndelig Velsignelse i det himmelske i
      Kristus,
  4.  ligesom han har udvalgt os i ham før Verdens Grundlæggelse til
      at være hellige og ulastelige for hans Åsyn,
  5.  idet han i Kærlighed forudbestemte os til Sønneudkårelse hos sig
      ved Jesus Kristus, efter sin Villies Velbehag,
  6.  til Pris for sin Nådes Herlighed, som han benådede os med i den
      elskede,
  7.  i hvem vi have Forløsningen ved hans Blod, Syndernes Forladelse,
      efter hans Nådes Rigdom,
  8.  som han rigelig tildelte os i al Visdom og Forstand,
  9.  idet han kundgjorde os sin Villies Hemmelighed, efter sin
      velbehagelige Beslutning, som han havde fattet hos sig selv,
 10.  for at oprette en Husholdning i Tidernes Fylde, nemlig at
      sammenfatte sig alt i Kristus, det, som er i Himlene, og det,
      som er på Jorden, i ham,
 11.  i hvem vi også have fået Arvelodden, forud bestemte efter hans
      Forsæt, der virker alt efter sin Villies Råd,
 12.  for at vi skulde være til Pris for hans Herlighed, vi, som forud
      havde håbet på Kristus,
 13.  i hvem også I, da I hørte Sandhedens Ord, Evangeliet om eders
      Frelse, i hvem I også, da I bleve troende, bleve beseglede med
      Forjættelsens hellige Ånd,
 14.  som er Pant på vor Arv, til Ejendommens Forløsning, til Pris for
      hans Herlighed.

 15.  derfor har også jeg, efter at have hørt om eders Tro på den
      Herre Jesus og om eders Kærlighed til alle de hellige,
 16.  ikke ophørt at takke for eder, idet jeg ihukommer eder i mine
      Bønner om,
 17.  at vor Herres Jesu Kristi Gud, Herlighedens Fader, må give eder
      Visdoms og Åbenbarelses Ånd i Erkendelse af ham,
 18.  gøre eders Hjertes Øjne oplyste til at kende, hvilket det Håb
      er, som han kaldte eder til, hvilken hans Arvs Herligheds Rigdom
      er iblandt de hellige,
 19.  og hvilken hans Krafts overvættes Storhed er over for os, som
      tro, alt efter hans Styrkes vældige Virkekraft,
 20.  som han udviste på Kristus, da han oprejste ham fra de døde og
      satte ham ved sin højre Hånd i det himmelske,
 21.  langt over al Magt og Myndighed og Kraft og Herredom og hvert
      Navn, som nævnes,ikke alene i denne Verden, men også i den
      kommende,
 22.  og lagde alt under hans Fødder, og ham gav han som Hoved over
      alting til Menigheden,
 23.  der er hans Legeme, fyldt af ham, som fylder alt i alle.

Efeserne 2

  1.  Også eder, da I vare døde ved eders Overtrædelser og Synder,
  2.  hvori I fordum vandrede efter denne Verdens Tidsånd, efter hans
      Vis, som hersker over Luftens Magt, over den Ånd, der nu er
      virksom i Genstridighedens Børn,
  3.  iblandt hvilke også vi fordum alle vandrede i vort Køds
      Begæringer og gjorde Kødets og Tankernes Villie og vare af Natur
      Vredes Børn ligesom også de andre,
  4.  men Gud, som er rig på Barmhjertighed, har for sin store
      Kærligheds Skyld, hvormed han elskede os,
  5.  også da vi vare døde ved vore Overtrædelser, levendegjort os med
      Kristus - af Nåde ere I frelste!
  6.  og medoprejst os og sat os med ham i det himmelske i Kristus
      Jesus,
  7.  for at han i de tilkommende Tider kunde vise sin Nådes
      overvættes Rigdom ved Godhed imod os i Kristus Jesus.
  8.  Thi af Nåden ere I frelste ved Tro, og det ikke af eder selv,
      Guds er Gaven;
  9.  ikke af Gerninger, for at ikke nogen skal rose sig.
 10.  Thi vi ere hans Værk, skabte i Kristus Jesus til gode Gerninger,
      som Gud forud beredte, for at vi skulde vandre i dem.

 11.  Derfor kommer i Hu, at fordum I Hedninger i Kødet, I, som bleve
      kaldte Forhud af den såkaldte Omskærelse, der sker i Kødet med
      Hånden,
 12.  at I på den Tid, uden for Kristus, vare udelukkede fra Israels
      Borgerret og fremmede for Forjættelsens Pagter, uden Håb og uden
      Gud i Verden.
 13.  Nu derimod, i Kristus Jesus, ere I, som fordum vare langt borte,
      komne nær til ved Kristi Blod.
 14.  Thi han er vor Fred, han, som gjorde begge til eet og nedbrød
      Gærdets Skillevæg,
 15.  Fjendskabet, da han i sit Kød afskaffede Budenes Lov med dens
      Befalinger, for at han i sig kunde skabe de to til eet nyt
      Menneske ved at stifte Fred
 16.  og for at forlige dem begge i eet Legeme med Gud ved Korset,
      idet han ved dette dræbte Fjendskabet.
 17.  Og han kom og forkyndte Fred for eder, som vare langt borte, og
      Fred for dem, som vare nær.
 18.  Thi ved ham have vi begge i een Ånd Adgang til Faderen.
 19.  Så ere I da ikke mere fremmede og Udlændinge, men I ere de
      helliges Medborgere og Guds Husfolk,
 20.  opbyggede på Apostlenes og Profeternes Grundvold, idet
      Hovedhjørnestenen er Kristus Jesus selv,
 21.  i hvem enhver Bygning sammenføjes og vokser til et helligt
      Tempel i Herren,
 22.  i hvem også I blive medopbyggede til en Guds Bolig i Ånden.

Efeserne 3

  1.  Det er for denne Sags Skyld, at jeg, Paulus, Kristi Jesu Fange
      for eder, I Hedninger,
  2.  om I da have hørt om Husholdningen med den Guds Nåde, som blev
      given mig til eder,
  3.  at ved Åbenbarelse blev Hemmeligheden kundgjort mig, således som
      jeg foran kortelig har skrevet,
  4.  hvoraf I, når I læse det, kunne skønne min Indsigt i Kristi
      Hemmelighed,
  5.  som i andre Slægter ikke blev kundgjort for Menneskenes Børn,
      således som den nu er bleven åbenbaret hans hellige Apostle og
      Profeter ved Ånden:
  6.  nemlig at Hedningerne ere Medarvinger og medindlemmede og
      meddelagtige i Forjættelsen i Kristus Jesus ved Evangeliet,
  7.  hvis Tjener jeg er bleven ifølge den Guds Nådes Gave, som blev
      given mig ved hans Magts Virkekraft.
  8.  Mig, den allerringeste af alle hellige, blev denne Nåde given at
      forkynde Hedningerne Evangeliet om Kristi uransagelige Rigdom
  9.  og at oplyse alle om, hvilken Husholdningen med den Hemmelighed
      er, som fra Evighed har været skjult i Gud, der skabte alle
      Ting,
 10.  for at Guds mangfoldige Visdom skulde nu ved Menigheden blive
      kundgjort for Magterne og Myndighederne i det himmelske,
 11.  efter det evige Forsæt, som han fuldbyrdede ved Kristus Jesus,
      vor Herre,
 12.  i hvem vi have Frimodigheden og Adgang med Tillid ved Troen på
      ham.
 13.  Derfor beder jeg, at I ikke tabe Modet over mine Trængsler, som
      jeg lider for eder, hvilket er en Ære for eder.

 14.  For denne Sags Skyld bøjer jeg mine Knæ for Faderen,
 15.  fra hvem enhver Faderlighed i Himle og på Jord har sit Navn,
 16.  at han vil give eder efter sin Herligheds Rigdom mægtigt at
      styrkes ved hans Ånd i det indvortes Menneske;
 17.  at Kristus må bo ved Troen i eders Hjerter,
 18.  for at I, rodfæstede og grundfæstede i Kærlighed, kunne sammen
      med alle de hellige formå at begribe, hvor stor Bredden og
      Længden og Dybden og Højden er,
 19.  og at kende Kristi Kærlighed, som overgår al Erkendelse, for at
      I kunne fyldes indtil hele Guds Fylde.

 20.  Men ham, som formår over alle Ting at gøre langt ud over det,
      som vi bede eller forstå, efter den Magt, som er virksom i os,
 21.  ham være Ære i Menigheden og i Kristus Jesus igennem alle
      Slægterne i Evighedernes Evighed! Amen.

Efeserne 4

  1.  Jeg formaner eder derfor, jeg, der fangne i Herren, til at
      vandre værdig den Kaldelse, med hvilken I bleve kaldede,
  2.  med al Ydmyghed og Sagtmodighed, med Langmodighed, så I bære
      over med hverandre i Kærlighed
  3.  og gøre eder Flid for at bevare Åndens Enhed i Fredens Bånd;
  4.  eet Legeme og een Ånd, ligesom I også bleve kaldede til eet Håb
      i eders Kaldelse;
  5.  een Herre, een Tro, een Dåb,
  6.  een Gud og alles Fader, som er over alle og igennem alle og i
      alle!

  7.  Men hver enkelt af os blev Nåden given efter Kristi Gaves Mål.
  8.  Derfor hedder det: "Da han opfor til det høje, bortførte han
      Fanger og gav Menneskene Gaver."
  9.  Men dette: "Han opfor," hvad er det, uden at han også nedfor til
      Jordens nedre Egne.
 10.  Han, som nedfor, han er også den, som opfor højt over alle.
      Himlene, for at han skulde fylde alle Ting.
 11.  Og han gav nogle som Apostle, andre som Profeter, andre som
      Evangelister, andre som Hyrder og Lærere,
 12.  til de helliges fuldkomne Beredelse, til en Tjenestegerning, til
      Kristi Legemes Opbyggelse,
 13.  indtil vi alle nå til Enheden i Troen på og Erkendelsen af Guds
      Søn, til Mands Modenhed, til Kristi Fyldes Mål af Vækst,
 14.  for at vi ikke; mere skulle være umyndige, der omtumles og
      omdrives af enhver Lærdommens Vind, ved Menneskenes Tærningspil,
      ved Træskhed efter Vildfarelsens Rænkespind;
 15.  men for at vi, Sandheden tro i Kærlighed, skulle i alle Måder
      opvokse til ham, som er Hovedet, Kristus,
 16.  ud fra hvem hele Legemet, idet det sammenføjes og sammenknyttes
      ved ethvert hjælpende Bindeled i Forhold til hver enkelt Dels
      tilmålte Virkekraft, fuldbyrder Legemets Vækst til Opbyggelse af
      sig selv i Kærlighed.

 17.  Dette siger jeg da og vidner i Herren, at I skulle ikke mere
      vandre, således som Hedningerne vandre i deres Sinds Tomhed,
 18.  formørkede i deres Tanke, fremmedgjorte for Guds Liv som Følge
      af den Vankundighed, som er i dem på Grund af deres Hjertes
      Forhærdelse,
 19.  de, som jo følesløse have hengivet sig til Uterligheden, til at
      øve al Urenhed i Havesyge.
 20.  Men I have ikke således lært Kristus,
 21.  om I da have hørt om ham og ere blevne oplærte i ham, således
      som Sandhed er i Jesus,
 22.  at I, hvad eders forrige Vandel angår, skulle aflægge det gamle
      Menneske, som fordærves ved bedrageriske Begæringer,
 23.  men fornyes i eders Sinds Ånd
 24.  og iføre eder det nye Menneske, som blev skabt efter Gud i
      Sandhedens Retfærdighed og Hellighed.

 25.  Derfor aflægger Løgnen og taler Sandhed, hver med sin Næste,
      efterdi vi ere hverandres Lemmer.
 26.  Blive I vrede, da synder ikke; lad ikke Solen gå ned over eders
      Forbitrelse;
 27.  giver ikke heller Djævelen Rum!
 28.  Den, som stjæler, stjæle ikke mere, men arbejde hellere og gøre
      det gode med sine egne Hænder, for at han kan have noget at
      meddele den, som er i Trang.
 29.  Lad ingen rådden Tale udgå af eders Mund, men sådan Tale, som er
      god til fornøden Opbyggelse, for at den kan skaffe dem Nåde, som
      høre derpå;
 30.  og bedrøver ikke Guds hellige Ånd, med hvilken I bleve beseglede
      til Forløsningens Dag.
 31.  Al Bitterhed og Hidsighed og Vrede og Skrigen og Forhånelse
      blive langt fra eder tillige med al Ondskab!
 32.  Men vorder velvillige imod hverandre, barmhjertige, tilgivende
      hverandre, ligesom jo Gud har tilgivet eder i Kristus.

Efeserne 5

  1.  Vorder derfor Guds Efterlignere som elskede Børn,
  2.  og vandrer i Kærlighed, ligesom også Kristus elskede os og gav
      sig selv hen for os som en Gave og et Slagtoffer, Gud til en
      velbehagelig Lugt.

  3.  Men Utugt og al Urenhed eller Havesyge bør end ikke nævnes
      iblandt eder, som det sømmer sig for hellige,
  4.  ej heller ublu Væsen eller dårlig Snak eller letfærdig Skæmt,
      hvilket er utilbørligt, men hellere Taksigelse.
  5.  Thi dette vide og erkende I, at ingen utugtig eller uren eller
      havesyg, hvilket er en Afgudsdyrker, har Arv i Kristi og Guds
      Rige.
  6.  Ingen bedrage eder med tomme Ord; thi for disse Ting kommer Guds
      Vrede over Genstridighedens Børn.
  7.  Derfor, bliver ikke meddelagtige med dem!
  8.  Thi I vare forhen Mørke, men nu ere I Lys i Herren; vandrer som
      Lysets Børn;
  9.  (Lysets Frugt viser sig jo i al Godhed og Retfærdighed og
      Sandhed,)
 10.  så I prøve, hvad der er velbehageligt for Herren.
 11.  Og haver ikke Samfund med Mørkets ufrugtbare Gerninger. Men
      revser dem hellere;
 12.  thi hvad der lønligt bedrives af dem, er skammeligt endog at
      sige;
 13.  men alt dette bliver åbenbaret, når det revses af Lyset. Thi alt
      det, som bliver åbenbaret, er Lys.
 14.  Derfor hedder det: "Vågn op, du, som sover, og stå op fra de
      døde, og Kristus skal lyse for dig!"

 15.  Ser derfor nøje til, hvorledes I vandre, ikke som uvise, men som
      vise,
 16.  så I købe den belejlige Tid, efterdi Dagene ere onde.
 17.  Derfor bliver ikke uforstandige, men skønner, hvad Herrens
      Villie er.
 18.  Og drikker eder ikke drukne i Vin, i hvilket der er
      Ryggesløshed, men lader eder fylde med Ånden,
 19.  så I tale hverandre til med Salmer og Lovsange og åndelige Viser
      og synge og spille i eders Hjerte for Herren
 20.  og altid sige Gud og Faderen Tak for alle Ting i vor Herres Jesu
      Kristi Navn
 21.  og underordne eder under hverandre i Kristi Frygt;

 22.  Hustruerne skulle underordne sig under deres egne Mænd, som
      under Herren;
 23.  thi en Mand er sin Hustrus Hoved, ligesom også Kristus er
      Menighedens Hoved. Han er sit Legemes Frelser.
 24.  Dog, ligesom Menigheden underordner sig under Kristus, således
      skulle også Hustruerne underordne sig under deres Mænd i alle
      Ting.
 25.  I Mænd! elsker eders Hustruer, ligesom også Kristus elskede
      Menigheden og hengav sig selv for den,
 26.  for at han kunde hellige den, idet han rensede den ved Vandbadet
      med et Ord,
 27.  for at han selv kunde fremstille Menigheden for sig som herlig,
      uden Plet eller Rynke eller noget deslige, men for at den måtte
      være hellig og ulastelig.
 28.  Således ere Mændene skyldige at elske deres egne Hustruer som
      deres egne Legemer; den,som elsker sin egen Hustru, elsker sig
      selv.
 29.  Ingen har jo nogen Sinde hadet sit eget Kød, men han nærer og
      plejer det, ligesom også Kristus Menigheden.
 30.  Thi vi ere Lemmer på hans Legeme.
 31.  Derfor skal et Menneske forlade sin Fader og Moder og holde fast
      ved sin Hustru, og de to skulle være eet Kød.
 32.  Denne Hemmelighed er stor - jeg sigter nemlig til Kristus og til
      Menigheden.
 33.  Dog, også I skulle elske hver især sin egen Hustru som sig selv;
      men Hustruen have Ærefrygt for Manden!

Efeserne 6

  1.  I Børn! adlyder eders Forældre i Herren, thi dette er ret.
  2.  "Ær din Fader og Moder", dette er jo det første Bud med
      Forjættelse,
  3.  "for at det må gå dig vel, og du må leve længe i Landet."
  4.  Og I Fædre! opirrer ikke eders Børn, men opfostrer dem i Herrens
      Tugt og Formaning!
  5.  I Trælle! adlyder eders Herrer efter Kødet med Frygt og Bæven i
      eders Hjertes Enfold som Kristus;
  6.  ikke med Øjentjeneste, som de, der ville tækkes Mennesker, men
      som Kristi Tjenere, så I gøre Guds Villie af Hjertet,
  7.  idet I med god Villie gøre Tjeneste som for Herren, og ikke for
      Mennesker,
  8.  idet I vide, at hvad godt enhver gør, det skal han få igen af
      Herren, hvad enten han er Træl eller fri.
  9.  Og I Herrer! gører det samme imod dem, så I lade Trusel fare,
      idet I vide, at både deres og eders Herre er i Himlene, og der
      er ikke Persons Anseelse hos ham.

 10.  For øvrigt bliver stærke i Herren og i hans Styrkes Vælde!
 11.  Ifører eder Guds fulde Rustning, for at I må kunne bolde Stand
      imod Djævelens snedige Anløb.
 12.  Thi for os står Kampen ikke imod Blod og Kød, men imod Magterne,
      imod Myndighederne, imod Verdensherskerne i dette Mørke, imod
      Ondskabens Åndemagter i det himmelske.
 13.  Derfor tager Guds fulde Rustning på, for at I må kunne stå imod
      på den onde Dag og bestå efter at have fuldbyrdet alt.
 14.  Så står da omgjordede om eders Lænd med Sandhed og iførte
      Retfærdighedens Panser.
 15.  Fødderne ombundne med Kampberedthed fra Fredens Evangelium;
 16.  og i alle Forhold løfter Troens Skjold, med hvilket I ville
      kunne slukke alle den ondes gloende Pile,
 17.  og tager imod Frelsens Hjelm og Åndens Sværd, som er Guds Ord,
 18.  idet I under al Påkaldelse og Bøn bede til enhver Tid i Ånden og
      ere årvågne dertil i al Vedholdenhed og Bøn for alle de hellige,
 19.  også for mig, om at der må gives mig Ord, når jeg oplader min
      Mund, til med Frimodighed at kundgøre Evangeliets Hemmelighed,
 20.  for hvis Skyld jeg er et Sendebud i Lænker, for at jeg må have
      Frimodighed deri til at tale, som jeg bør.

 21.  Men for at også I skulle kende mine Forhold, hvorledes det går
      mig, da skal Tykikus, den elskede Broder og tro Tjener i Herren
      kundgøre eder alt;
 22.  ham sender jeg til eder, just for at I skulle lære at kende,
      hvorledes det står til hos os, og for at han skal opmuntre eders
      Hjerter.

 23.  Fred være med Brødrene og Kærlighed med Tro fra Gud Fader og den
      Herre Jesus Kristus!
 24.  Nåden være med alle dem, som elske vor Herre Jesus Kristus i
      Uforkrænkelighed!


Filipperne

Filipperne 1

  1.  Paulus og Timotheus, Kristi Jesu Tjener, til alle de hellige i
      Kristus Jesus, som ere i Filippi, med Tilsynsmænd og
      Menighedstjenere.
  2.  Nåde være med eder og Fred fra Gud vor Fader og den Herre Jesus
      Kristus!

  3.  Jeg takker min Gud, så ofte jeg kommer eder i Hu,
  4.  idet jeg altid, i hver min Bøn, beder for eder alle med Glæde,
  5.  for eders Deltagelse i Evangeliet fra den første Dag indtil nu;
  6.  forvisset om dette, at han, som begyndte en god Gerning i eder,
      vil fuldføre den indtil Jesu Kristi Dag,
  7.  således som det jo er ret for mig at mene dette om eder alle,
      efterdi jeg har eder i Hjertet både under mine Lænker og under
      Evangeliets Forsvar og Stadfæstelse, fælles som I jo alle ere
      med mig om Nåden.
  8.  Thi Gud er mit Vidne, hvorledes jeg længes efter eder alle med
      Kristi Jesu inderlige Kærlighed.
  9.  Og derom beder jeg, at eders Kærlighed fremdeles må blive mere
      og mere rig på Erkendelse og al Skønsomhed,
 10.  så I kunne værdsætte de forskellige Ting, for at I må være rene
      og uden Anstød til Kristi Dag,
 11.  fyldte med Retfærdigheds Frugt, som virkes ved Jesus Kristus,
      Gud til Ære og Pris.

 12.  Men jeg vil, I skulle vide, Brødre! at mine Forhold snarere have
      tjent til Evangeliets Fremme,
 13.  så at det er blevet åbenbart for hele Livvagten og for alle de
      øvrige, at mine Lænker bæres for Kristi Skyld,
 14.  og de fleste af Brødrene fik i Tillid til Herren ved mine Lænker
      end mere Dristighed til at tale Guds Ord uden Frygt.
 15.  Nogle prædike vel også Kristus for Avinds og Kivs Skyld, men
      nogle også i en god Mening.
 16.  Disse gøre det af Kærlighed, vidende, at jeg er sat til at
      forsvare Evangeliet;
 17.  men hine forkynde Kristus af Egennytte, ikke ærligt, men i den
      Tanke at føje Trængsel til mine Lænker.
 18.  Hvad så? Kristus forkyndes dog på enhver Måde, være sig på
      Skrømt eller i Sandhed; og derover glæder jeg mig, og jeg vil
      også fremdeles glæde mig.
 19.  Thi jeg ved, at dette skal blive mig til Frelse ved eders Bøn og
      Jesu Kristi Ånds Hjælp,
 20.  efter min Længsel og mit Håb, at jeg i intet skal blive til
      Skamme, men at Kristus skal med al Frimodighed, som altid, så
      også nu, forherliges i mit Legeme, være sig ved Liv eller ved
      Død.
 21.  Thi det at leve er mig Kristus og at dø en Vinding.
 22.  Men dersom dette at leve i Kødet skaffer mig Frugt af min
      Gerning, så ved jeg ikke, hvad jeg skal vælge;
 23.  men jeg står tvivlrådig imellem de to Ting, idet jeg har Lysten
      til at bryde op og være sammen med Kristus; thi dette var såre
      meget bedre;
 24.  men at forblive i Kødet er mere nødvendigt for eders Skyld.
 25.  Og i Forvisning herom ved jeg, at jeg skal blive i Live og
      forblive hos eder alle til eders Fremgang og Glæde i Troen,
 26.  for at eders Ros ved mig kan blive rig i Kristus Jesus, ved at
      jeg atter kommer til Stede iblandt eder.

 27.  Kun skulle I leve Kristi Evangelium værdigt, for at, hvad enten
      jeg kommer og ser eder eller er fraværende, jeg dog kan høre om
      eder, at I stå faste i een Ånd, så at I med een Sjæl stride
      tilsammen for Troen på Evangeliet
 28.  og ikke lade eder forfærde i nogen Ting af Modstanderne; thi
      dette er for dem et Tegn på Undergang, men for eder på Frelse,
      og det fra Gud.
 29.  Thi eder er det forundt for Kristi Skyld - ikke alene at tro på
      ham, men også at lide for hans Skyld,
 30.  idet I have den samme Kamp, som I have set på mig og nu høre om
      mig.

Filipperne 2

  1.  Er der da nogen Formaning i Kristus, er der nogen Kærlighedens
      Opmuntring, er der noget Åndens Samfund, er der nogen inderlig
      Kærlighed og Barmhjertighed:
  2.  da fuldkommer min Glæde, at I må være enige indbyrdes, så I have
      den samme Kærlighed, samme Sjæl, een Higen,
  3.  intet gøre af Egennytte eller Lyst til tom Ære, men i Ydmyghed
      agte hverandre højere end eder selv
  4.  og ikke se hver på sit, men enhver også på andres.
  5.  Det samme Sindelag være i eder, som også var i Kristus Jesus,
  6.  han, som, da han var i Guds Skikkelse ikke holdt det for et Rov
      at være Gud lig,
  7.  men forringede sig selv, idet han tog en Tjeners Skikkelse på og
      blev Mennesker lig;
  8.  og da han i Fremtræden fandtes som et Menneske, fornedrede han
      sig selv, så han blev lydig indtil Døden, ja, Korsdøden.
  9.  Derfor har også Gud højt ophøjet ham og skænket ham det Navn,
      som er over alle Navne,
 10.  for at i Jesu Navn hvert Knæ skal bøje sig, deres i Himmelen og
      på Jorden og under Jorden,
 11.  og hver Tunge skal bekende, at Jesus Kristus er Herre, til Gud
      Faders Ære.

 12.  Derfor, mine elskede! ligesom I altid have været lydige, så
      arbejder ikke alene som i min Nærværelse, men nu meget mere i
      min Fraværelse på eders egen Frelse med Frygt og Bæven;
 13.  thi Gud er den, som virker i eder både at ville og at virke,
      efter sit Velbehag.
 14.  Gører alle Ting uden Knurren og Betænkeligheder,
 15.  for at I må blive udadlelige og rene, Guds ulastelige Børn, midt
      i en vanartet og forvendt Slægt, iblandt hvilke I vise eder som
      Himmellys i Verden,
 16.  idet I fremholde Livets Ord, mig til Ros på Kristi Dag, at jeg
      ikke har løbet forgæves, ej heller arbejdet forgæves.
 17.  Ja, selv om jeg bliver ofret under Ofringen og Betjeningen af
      eders Tro, så glæder jeg mig og glæder mig med eder alle.
 18.  Men ligeledes skulle også I glæde eder, og glæde eder med mig!


 19.  Men jeg håber i den Herre Jesus snart at kunne sende Timotheus
      til eder, for at også jeg kan blive ved godt Mod ved at erfare,
      hvorledes det går eder.
 20.  Thi jeg har ingen ligesindet, der så oprigtig vil have Omsorg
      for, hvorledes det går eder;
 21.  thi de søge alle deres eget, ikke hvad der hører Kristus Jesus
      til.
 22.  Men hans prøvede Troskab kende I, at, ligesom et Barn tjener sin
      Fader, således har han tjent med mig for Evangeliet.
 23.  Ham håber jeg altså at sende straks, når jeg ser Udgangen på min
      Sag.
 24.  Men jeg har den Tillid til Herren, at jeg også selv snart skal
      komme.

 25.  Men jeg har agtet det nødvendigt at sende Epafroditus til eder,
      min Broder og Medarbejder og Medstrider, og eders Udsending og
      Tjener for min Trang,
 26.  efterdi han længtes efter eder alle og var såre ængstelig, fordi
      I havde hørt, at han var bleven syg.
 27.  Ja, han var også syg og Døden nær; men Gud forbarmede sig over
      ham, ja, ikke alene over ham, men også over mig, for at jeg ikke
      skulde have Sorg på Sorg.
 28.  Derfor skynder jeg mig desto mere med at sende ham, for at I og
      jeg være mere sorgfri.
 29.  Modtager ham altså i Herren med al Glæde og holder sådanne i
      Ære;
 30.  thi for Kristi Gernings Skyld kom han Døden nær, idet han satte
      sit Liv i Vove for at udfylde Savnet af eder i eders Tjeneste
      imod mig.

Filipperne 3

  1.  I øvrigt, mine Brødre glæder eder i Herren! At skrive det samme
      til eder er ikke til Besvær for mig, men er betryggende for
      eder.
  2.  Holder Øje med Hundene, holder Øje med de slette Arbejdere,
      holder Øje med Sønderskærelsen!
  3.  Thi vi ere Omskærelsen, vi, som tjene i Guds Ånd og rose os i
      Kristus Jesus og ikke forlade os på Kødet",
  4.  endskønt også jeg har det, jeg kunde forlade mig på også i
      Kødet, Dersom nogen anden synes, han kan forlade sig på Kødet,
      kan jeg det mere.
  5.  Jeg er omskåren på den ottende Dag, af Israels Slægt, Benjamins
      Stamme, en Hebræer af Hebræere, over for Loven en Farisæer,
  6.  i Nidkærhed en Forfølger af Menigheden, i Retfærdigheden efter
      Loven udadlelig.
  7.  Men hvad der var mig Vinding, det har jeg for Kristi Skyld agtet
      for Tab;
  8.  ja sandelig, jeg agter endog alt for at være Tab imod det langt
      højere, at kende Kristus Jesus, min Herre, for hvis Skyld jeg
      har lidt Tab på alt og agter det for Skarn, for at jeg kan vinde
      Kristus
  9.  og findes i ham, så jeg ikke har min Retfærdighed, den af Loven,
      men den ved Tro på Kristus, Retfærdigheden fra Gud på Grundlag
      af Troen,
 10.  for at jeg må kende ham og hans Opstandelses Kraft og hans
      Lidelsers Samfund, idet jeg bliver ligedannet med hans Død,
 11.  om jeg dog kunde nå til Opstandelsen fra de døde.

 12.  Ikke at jeg allerede har grebet det eller allerede er
      fuldkommen; men jeg jager derefter, om jeg dog kunde gribe det,
      efterdi jeg også er greben af Kristus Jesus.
 13.  Brødre! jeg mener ikke om mig selv, at jeg har grebet det.
 14.  Men eet gør jeg: glemmende, hvad der er bagved, men rækkende
      efter det, som er foran, jager jeg imod Målet, til den
      Sejrspris, hvortil Gud fra det høje kaldte os i Kristus Jesus.
 15.  Lader da os, så mange som ere fuldkomne, have dette Sindelag; og
      er der noget, hvori I ere anderledes sindede, da skal Gud
      åbenbare eder også dette.
 16.  Kun at vi, så vidt vi ere komne, vandre i samme Retning.

 17.  Vorder mine Efterlignere, Brødre! og agter på dem, der vandre
      således, som I have os til Forbillede.
 18.  Thi mange vandre, som jeg ofte har sagt eder, men nu også siger
      med Tårer, som Kristi Kors's Fjender,
 19.  hvis Ende er Fortabelse, hvis Gud er Bugen, og hvis Ære er i
      deres Skændsel, de, som tragte efter de jordiske Ting.
 20.  Thi vort Borgerskab er i Himlene, hvorfra vi også forvente som
      Frelser den Herre Jesus Kristus,
 21.  der skal forvandle vort Fornedrelses-Legeme til at blive
      ligedannet med hans Herligheds-Legeme, efter den Kraft, ved
      hvilken han også kan underlægge sig alle Ting.

  1.  Derfor, mine Brødre, elskede og savnede, min Glæde og Krans!
      står således fast i Herren, I elskede!

  2.  Evodia formaner jeg, og Syntyke formaner jeg til at være enige i
      Herren.
  3.  Ja, jeg beder også dig, min ægte Synzygus! tag dig af dem; thi
      de have med mig stridt i Evangeliet, tillige med Klemens og mine
      øvrige Medarbejdere, hvis Navne stå i Livets Bog.

  4.  Glæder eder i Herren altid; atter siger jeg: glæder eder!
  5.  Eders milde Sind vorde kendt af alle Mennesker! Herren er nær!
  6.  Værer ikke bekymrede for noget, men lader i alle Ting eders
      Begæringer komme frem for Gud i Påkaldelse og Bøn med
      Taksigelse;
  7.  og Guds Fred, som overgår al Forstand, skal bevare eders Hjerter
      og eders Tanker i Kristus Jesus.
  8.  I øvrigt, Brødre! alt, hvad der er sandt, hvad der er ærbart,
      hvad der er retfærdigt, hvad der er rent, hvad der er elskeligt,
      hvad der har godt Lov, enhver Dyd og enhver Hæder: lægger eder
      det på Sinde!
  9.  Hvad I både have lært og modtaget og hørt og set på mig, dette
      skulle I gøre, og Fredens Gud skal være med eder.

 10.  Men jeg har højlig glædet mig i Herren over, at I nu omsider ere
      komne til Kræfter, så at I kunne tænke på mit Vel, hvorpå I også
      forhen tænkte, men I manglede Lejlighed.
 11.  Dette siger jeg ikke af Trang; thi jeg har lært at nøjes med
      det, jeg har.
 12.  Jeg forstår at være i ringe Kår, og jeg forstår også at have
      Overflod; i alt og hvert er jeg indviet, både i at mættes og i
      at hungre, både i at have Overflod og i at lide Savn.
 13.  Alt formår jeg i ham, som gør mig stærk.
 14.  Dog gjorde I vel i at tage Del i min Trængsel.
 15.  Men I vide det også selv, Filippensere! at i Evangeliets
      Begyndelse, da jeg drog ud fra Makedonien, var der ingen
      Menighed, som havde Regning med mig over givet og modtaget, uden
      I alene.
 16.  Thi endog i Thessalonika sendte I mig både een og to Gange, hvad
      jeg havde nødig.
 17.  Ikke at jeg attrår Gaven, men jeg attrår den Frugt, som bliver
      rigelig til eders Fordel.
 18.  Nu har jeg nok af alt og har Overflod; jeg har fuldt op efter
      ved Epafroditus at have modtaget eders Gave, en Vellugts-Duft,
      et velkomment Offer, velbehageligt for Gud.
 19.  Men min Gud skal efter sin Rigdom fuldelig give eder alt, hvad I
      have nødig, i Herlighed i Kristus Jesus.
 20.  Men ham, vor Gud og Fader, være Æren i Evigheders Evigheder!
      Amen.

 21.  Hilser hver hellig i Kristus Jesus.
 22.  De Brødre, som ere hos mig, hilse eder. Alle de hellige hilse
      eder, men mest de af Kejserens Hus.
 23.  Den Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde være med eders Ånd!


Kolossenserne

Kolossenserne 1

  1.  Paulus, Kristi Jesu Apostel ved Guds Villie, og Broderen
      Timotheus.
  2.  til de hellige og troende Brødre i Kristus i Kolossæ: Nåde være
      med eder og Fred fra Gud vor Fader!

  3.  Vi takke Gud og vor Herres Jesu Kristi Fader altid, når vi bede
      for eder,
  4.  da vi have hørt om eders Tro på Kristus Jesus og den Kærlighed,
      som I have til alle de hellige
  5.  på Grund af det Håb, som er henlagt til eder i Himlene, om
      hvilket I forud have hørt i Evangeliets Sandheds Ord,
  6.  der er kommet til eder, ligesom det også er i den hele Verden,
      idet det bærer Frugt og vokser, ligesom det også gør iblandt
      eder fra den Dag, I hørte og erkendte Guds Nåde i Sandhed,
  7.  således som I have lært af Epafras, vor elskede Medtjener som er
      en tro Kristi Tjener for eder,
  8.  han, som også gav os eders Kærlighed i Ånden til Kende.

  9.  Derfor have også vi fra den Dag, vi hørte det, ikke ophørt at
      bede for eder og begære, at I måtte fyldes med Erkendelsen af
      hans Villie i al Visdom og åndelige Indsigt
 10.  til at vandre Herren værdigt, til alt Velbehag, idet I bære
      Frugt og vokse i al god Gerning ved Erkendelsen af Gud,
 11.  idet I styrkes med al Styrke efter hans Herligheds Kraft til al
      Udholdenhed og Tålmodighed med Glæde
 12.  og takke Faderen, som gjorde os dygtige til at have Del i de
      helliges Arvelod i Lyset,
 13.  han, som friede os ud af Mørkets Magt og satte os over i sin
      elskede Søns Rige,

 14.  i hvem vi have Forløsningen, Syndernes Forladelse,
 15.  han, som er den usynlige Guds Billede, al Skabnings førstefødte;
 16.  thi i ham bleve alle Ting skabte i Himlene og på Jorden, de
      synlige og de usynlige, være sig Troner eller Herredømmer eller
      Magter eller Myndigheder. Alle Ting ere skabte ved ham og til
      ham;
 17.  og han er forud for alle Ting, og alle Ting bestå ved ham.
 18.  Og han er Legemets Hoved, nemlig Menighedens, han, som er
      Begyndelsen, førstefødt ud af de døde, for at han skulde blive
      den ypperste i alle Ting;
 19.  thi det behagede Gud, at i ham skulde hele Fylden bo,
 20.  og ved ham at forlige alle Ting med sig, være sig dem på Jorden
      eller dem i Himlene, idet han stiftede Fred ved hans Kors's
      Blod.
 21.  Også eder, som fordum vare fremmedgjorte og fjendske af Sindelag
      i eders onde Gerninger,
 22.  har han dog nu forligt i sit Køds Legeme ved Døden for at
      fremstille eder hellige og ulastelige og ustraffelige for sit
      Åsyn,
 23.  så sandt I blive i Troen, grundfæstede og faste, uden at lade
      eder rokke fra Håbet i det Evangelium, som I have hørt, hvilket
      er blevet prædiket i al Skabningen under Himmelen, og hvis
      Tjener jeg Paulus er bleven.

 24.  Nu glæder jeg mig over mine Lidelser for eder, og hvad der
      fattes i Kristi Trængsler, udfylder jeg i mit Kød for hans
      Legeme, som er Menigheden,
 25.  hvis Tjener jeg er bleven efter den Guds Husholdning, som blev
      given mig over for eder, nemlig fuldelig at forkynde Guds Ord,
 26.  den Hemmelighed, der var skjult igennem alle Tider og Slægter,
      men nu er bleven åbenbaret for hans hellige,
 27.  hvem Gud vilde tilkendegive, hvilken Rigdom på Herlighed iblandt
      Hedningerne der ligger i denne Hemmelighed, som er Kristus i
      eder, Herlighedens Håb,
 28.  hvem vi forkynde, idet vi påminde hvert Menneske og lære hvert
      Menneske med al Visdom, for at vi kunne fremstille hvert
      Menneske som fuldkomment i Kristus;
 29.  hvorpå jeg også arbejder, idet jeg kæmper ifølge hans Kraft, som
      virker mægtigt i mig.

Kolossenserne 2

  1.  Thi jeg vil, at I skulle vide, hvor stor en Kamp jeg har for
      eder og for dem i Laodikea og for alle, som ikke have set mit
      Åsyn i Kødet,
  2.  for at deres Hjerter må opmuntres, idet de sammenknyttes i
      Kærlighed og til den fuldvisse Indsigts hele Rigdom, til
      Erkendelse af Guds Hemmelighed, Kristus.
  3.  i hvem alle Visdommens og Kundskabens Skatte findes skjulte.

  4.  Dette siger jeg, for at ingen skal bedrage eder med lokkende
      Tale.
  5.  Thi om jeg også i Kødet er fraværende, så er jeg dog i Ånden hos
      eder og glæder mig ved at se eders Orden og Fastheden i eders
      Tro på Kristus.
  6.  Derfor, ligesom I have modtaget Kristus Jesus, Herren, så
      vandrer i ham,
  7.  idet I ere rodfæstede og opbygges i ham og, stadfæstes ved
      Troen, således som I bleve oplærte, så I vokse i den med
      Taksigelse.
  8.  Ser til, at der ikke skal være nogen, som gør eder til Bytte ved
      den verdslige Visdom og tomt Bedrag efter Menneskers
      Overlevering, efter Verdens Børnelærdom og ikke efter Kristus;

  9.  thi i ham bor Guddommens hele Fylde legemlig,
 10.  og i ham have I eders Fylde, ham, som er Hovedet for al Magt og
      Myndighed;
 11.  i hvem I også ere blevne omskårne med en Omskærelse, som ikke er
      gjort med Hænder, ved Afførelsen af Kødets Legeme, ved Kristi
      Omskærelse,
 12.  idet I bleve begravne med ham i Dåben, i hvilken I også bleve
      medoprejste ved Troen på Guds Virkekraft, som oprejste ham fra
      de døde.
 13.  Også eder, som vare døde i eders Overtrædelser og eders Køds
      Forhud, eder gjorde han levende tillige med ham, idet han tilgav
      os alle vore Overtrædelser
 14.  og udslettede det imod os rettede Gældsbrev med dets Befalinger,
      hvilket gik os imod, og han har taget det bort ved at nagle det
      til Korset;
 15.  efter at have afvæbnet Magterne og Myndighederne, stillede han
      dem åbenlyst til Skue, da han i ham førte dem i Sejrstog.

 16.  Lad derfor ingen dømme eder for Mad eller for Drikke eller i
      Henseende til Højtid eller Nymåne eller Sabbat,
 17.  hvilket er en Skygge af det, som skulde komme, men Legemet er
      Kristi.
 18.  Lad ingen frarøve eder Sejrsprisen, idet han finder Behag i
      Ydmyghed og Dyrkelse af Englene, idet han indlader sig på, hvad
      han har set i Syner, forfængeligt opblæst af sit kødelige Sind,
 19.  og ikke holder fast ved Hovedet, ud fra hvem hele Legemet, idet
      det hjælpes og sammenknyttes ved sine Bindeled og Bånd, vokser
      Guds Vækst.
 20.  Når I med Kristus ere døde fra Verdens Børnelærdom, hvorfor lade
      I eder da pålægge Befalinger, som om I levede i Verden:
 21.  "Tag ikke, smag ikke, rør ikke derved!"
 22.  (hvilket alt er bestemt til at forgå ved at forbruges) efter
      Menneskenes Bud og Lærdomme?
 23.  thi alt dette har Ord for Visdom ved selvgjort Dyrkelse og
      Ydmyghed og Skånselsløshed imod Legemet, ikke ved noget, som er
      Ære værd, kun til Tilfredsstillelse af Kødet.

Kolossenserne 3

  1.  Når I altså, ere blevne oprejste med Kristus, da søger det, som
      er oventil, hvor Kristus sidder ved Guds højre Hånd.
  2.  Tragter efter det, som er oventil, ikke efter det, som er på
      Jorden.
  3.  Thi I ere døde, og eders Liv er skjult med Kristus i Gud.
  4.  Når Kristus, vort Liv, åbenbares, da skulle også I åbenbares med
      ham i Herlighed.

  5.  Så døder da de jordiske Lemmer, Utugt Urenhed, Brynde, ondt
      Begær og Havesygen, som jo er Afgudsdyrkelse;
  6.  for disse Tings Skyld kommer Guds Vrede.
  7.  I dem vandrede også I fordum, da I levede deri.
  8.  Men nu skulle også I aflægge det alt sammen, Vrede, Hidsighed,
      Ondskab, Forhånelse, slem Snak af eders Mund.
  9.  Lyver ikke for hverandre, da I have afført eder det gamle
      Menneske med dets Gerninger
 10.  og iført eder det nye, som fornyes til Erkendelse efter hans
      Billede, der skabte det;
 11.  hvor der ikke er Græker og Jøde, Omskærelse og Forhud, Barbar,
      Skyther, Træl, fri, men Kristus er alt og i alle.

 12.  Så ifører eder da som Guds udvalgte, hellige og elskede inderlig
      Barmhjertighed, Godhed, Ydmyghed, Sagtmodighed, Langmodighed,
 13.  så I bære over med hverandre og tilgive hverandre,dersom nogen
      har Klagemål imod nogen; ligesom Kristus tilgav eder, således
      også I!
 14.  Men over alt dette skulle I iføre eder Kærligheden, hvilket er
      Fuldkommenhedens Bånd.
 15.  Og Kristi Fred råde i eders Hjerter, til hvilken I også bleve
      kaldede i eet Legeme; og vorder taknemmelige!
 16.  Lad Kristi Ord bo rigeligt iblandt eder, så I med al Visdom lære
      og påminde hverandre med Salmer, Lovsange og åndelige Viser,
      idet I synge med Ynde i eders Hjerter for Gud.
 17.  Og alt, hvad I gøre i Ord eller i Handling, det gører alt i den
      Herres Jesu Navn, takkende Gud Fader ved ham.

 18.  I Hustruer! underordner eder under eders Mænd, som det sømmer
      sig i Herren.
 19.  I Mænd! elsker eders Hustruer, og værer ikke bitre imod dem!
 20.  I Børn! adlyder i alle Ting eders Forældre, thi dette er
      velbehageligt i Herren.
 21.  I Fædre! opirrer ikke eders Børn, for at de ikke skulle tabe
      Modet.
 22.  I Trælle! adlyder i alle Ting eders Herrer efter Kødet, ikke med
      Øjentjeneste som de, der ville tækkes Mennesker, men i Hjertets
      Enfold, frygtende Herren.
 23.  Hvad I end foretage eder, så gører det af Hjertet, som for
      Herren og ikke for Mennesker,
 24.  da I vide, at I af Herren skulle få Arven til Vederlag; det er
      den Herre Kristus, I tjene.
 25.  Thi den, som gør Uret, skal få igen, hvad Uret han gjorde, og
      der er ikke Persons Anseelse.
4-1.  I Herrer! yder eders Trælle, hvad ret og billigt er, da I vide,
      at også I have en Herre i Himmelen.

Kolossenserne 4
  2.  Værer vedholdendene i; Bønnen, idet I ere årvågne i den med
      Taksigelse.
  3.  idet I tillige bede også for os, at Gud vil oplade os en Ordets
      Dør til at tale Kristi Hemmelighed, for hvis Skyld jeg også er
      bunden,
  4.  for at jeg kan åbenbare den således, som jeg bør tale.

  5.  Vandrer i Visdom overfor dem, som ere udenfor, så I købe den
      belejlige Tid.
  6.  Eders Tale være altid med Ynde, krydret med Salt, så I vide,
      hvorledes I bør svare enhver især.

  7.  Hvorledes det går mig, skal Tykikus, den elskede Broder og tro
      Tjener og Medtjener i Herren, kundgøre eder alt sammen;
  8.  ham sender jeg til eder, netop for at I skulle lære at kende,
      hvorledes det står til med os, og for at han skal opmuntre eders
      Hjerter,
  9.  tillige med Onesimus, den tro og elskede Broder, som er fra
      eders By; de skulle fortælle eder, hvorledes alt står til her.

 10.  Aristarkus, min Medfange, hilser eder, og Markus, Barnabas's
      Søskendebarn, om hvem I have fået Befalinger - dersom han kommer
      til eder, da tager imod ham -
 11.  og Jesus, som kaldes Justus, hvilke af de omskårne ere de eneste
      Medarbejdere for Guds Rige, som ere blevne mig en Trøst.
 12.  Epafras hilser eder, han, som er fra eders By, en Kristi Jesu
      Tjener, som altid strider for eder i sine Bønner, før at I må
      stå fuldkomne og fuldvisse i al Guds Villie.
 13.  Thi jeg giver ham det Vidnesbyrd, at han har megen Møje for eder
      og dem i Laodikea og dem i Hierapolis,
 14.  Lægen Lukas, den elskede, hilser eder, og Demas.
 15.  Hilser Brødrene i Laodikea og Nymfas og Menigheden i deres Hus.
 16.  Og når dette Brev er oplæst hos eder, da sørger for, at det også
      bliver oplæst i Laodikensernes Menighed, og at I også læse
      Brevet fra Laodikea.
 17.  Og siger til Arkippus: Giv Agt på den Tjeneste, som du har
      modtaget i Herren, at du fuldbyrder den.

 18.  Hilsenen med min, Paulus's, egen Hånd. Kommer mine Lænker i Hu
      Nåde være med eder!


1.Tessalonikerne

1.Tessalonikerne 1

  1.  Paulus og Silvanus og Timotheus til Thessalonikernes Menighed i
      Gud Fader og den Herre Jesus Kristus. Nåde være med eder og
      Fred!

  2.  Vi takke Gud altid for eder alle, når vi komme eder i Hu i vore
      Bønner,
  3.  idet vi uafladelig mindes eders Gerning i Troen og eders Arbejde
      i Kærligheden og eders Udholdenhed i Håbet på vor Herre Jesus
      Kristus for vor Guds og Faders Åsyn,
  4.  efterdi vi kende eders Udvælgelse, I af Gud elskede Brødre,
  5.  at vort Evangelium ikke kom til eder i Ord alene, men også i
      Kraft og i den Helligånd og i fuld Overbevisning, som I jo vide,
      hvorledes vi færdedes iblandt eder for eders Skyld.
  6.  Og I ere blevne vore Efterfølgere, ja, Herrens, idet I modtoge
      Ordet under megen Trængsel med Glæde i den Helligånd,
  7.  så at I ere blevne et Forbillede for alle de troende i
      Makedonien og Akaja;
  8.  thi fra eder har Herrens Ord lydt ud, ikke alene i Makedonien og
      Akaja, men alle Vegne er eders Tro på Gud kommen ud, så at vi
      ikke have nødig at tale derom.
  9.  Thi de forkynde selv om os, hvordan en Indgang vi vandt hos
      eder, og hvorledes I vendte om til Gud fra Afguderne for at
      tjene den levende og sande Gud
 10.  og vente på hans Søn fra Himlene, hvem han oprejste fra de døde,
      Jesus, som frier os fra den kommende Vrede.

1.Tessalonikerne 2

  1.  I vide jo selv, Brødre! at vor Indgang hos eder ikke har været
      forgæves;
  2.  men skønt vi, som I vide, forud havde lidt og vare blevne
      mishandlede i Filippi, fik vi Frimodighed i vor Gud til at tale
      Guds Evangelium til eder under megen Kamp.
  3.  Thi vor Prædiken skyldes ikke Bedrag, ej heller Urenhed og er
      ikke forbunden med Svig;
  4.  men ligesom vi af Gud ere fundne værdige til at få Evangeliet
      betroet, således tale vi, ikke for at behage Mennesker, men Gud,
      som prøver vore Hjerter.
  5.  Thi vor Færd var hverken nogen Sinde med smigrende Tale - som I
      vide - ej heller var den et Skalkeskjul for Havesyge - Gud er
      Vidne;
  6.  ikke heller søgte vi Ære af Mennesker, hverken af eder eller af
      andre, skønt vi som Kristi Apostle nok kunde have været eder til
      Byrde.
  7.  Men vi færdedes med Mildhed iblandt eder. Som når en Moder ammer
      sine egne Børn,
  8.  således fandt vi, af inderlig Kærlighed til eder, en Glæde i at
      dele med eder ikke alene Guds Evangelium, men også vort eget
      Liv, fordi I vare blevne os elskelige.
  9.  I erindre jo, Brødre! vor Møje og Anstrengelse; arbejdende Nat
      og Dag, for ikke at være nogen af eder til Byrde, prædikede vi
      Guds Evangelium for eder.
 10.  I ere Vidner, og Gud, hvor fromt og retfærdigt og ulasteligt vi
      færdedes iblandt eder, som tro;
 11.  ligesom I vide, hvorledes vi formanede og opmuntrede hver enkelt
      af eder som en Fader sine Børn
 12.  og besvore eder, at I skulde vandre Gud værdigt, ham, som kaldte
      eder til sit Rige og sin Herlighed.

 13.  Og derfor takke også vi Gud uafladelig, fordi, da I modtoge Guds
      Ord, som I hørte af os, toge I ikke imod det som Menneskers Ord,
      men som Guds Ord (hvad det sandelig er), hvilket også viser sig
      virksomt i eder, som tro.
 14.  Thi I, Brødre! ere blevne Efterfølgere af Guds Menigheder i
      Judæa i Kristus Jesus, efterdi også I have lidt det samme af
      eders egne Stammefrænder, som de have lidt af Jøderne,
 15.  der både ihjelsloge den Herre Jesus og Profeterne og udjoge os
      og ikke behage Gud og stå alle Mennesker imod,
 16.  idet de forhindre os i at tale til Hedningerne til deres Frelse,
      for til enhver Tid at fylde deres Synders Mål; men Vreden er
      kommen over dem fuldtud.

 17.  Men vi, Brødre! som en stakket Tid have været skilte fra eder i
      det ydre, ikke i Hjertet, vi have gjort os des mere Flid for at
      få eders Ansigt at se, under megen Længsel,
 18.  efterdi vi have haft i Sinde at komme til eder, jeg, Paulus,
      både een og to Gange, og Satan har hindret os deri.
 19.  Thi hvem er vort Håb eller vor Glæde eller vor Hæderskrans, når
      ikke også I ere det for vor Herre Jesus Kristus i hans
      Tilkommelse?
 20.  I ere jo vor Ære og Glæde.

1.Tessalonikerne 3

  1.  Derfor, da vi ikke længer kunde udholde det, besluttede vi at
      lades alene tilbage i Athen,
  2.  og vi sendte Timotheus, vor Broder og Guds Tjener i Kristi
      Evangelium, for at styrke eder og formane eder angående eders
      Tro,
  3.  for at ingen skulde blive vakelmodig i disse Trængsler; I vide
      jo selv, at dertil ere vi bestemte.
  4.  Thi også da vi vare hos eder, sagde vi eder det forud, at vi
      skulde komme til at lide Trængsler, som det også er sket, og som
      I vide.
  5.  Derfor sendte også jeg Bud, da jeg ikke længer kunde udholde
      det, for at få Besked om eders Tro, om måske Fristeren skulde
      have fristet eder, og vor Møje skulde blive forgæves.

  6.  Men nu, da Timotheus er kommen til os fra eder og har bragt os
      godt Budskab om eders Tro og Kærlighed og om, at I altid have os
      i god Ihukommelse, idet I længes efter at se os, ligesom vi
      efter eder:
  7.  så ere vi af den Grund, Brødre! blevne trøstede med Hensyn til
      eder under al vor Nød og Trængsel, ved eders Tro.
  8.  Thi nu leve vi, når I stå fast i Herren.
  9.  Thi hvilken Tak kunne vi bringe Gud for eder til Gengæld for al
      den Glæde; hvormed vi glæde os over eder for vor Guds Åsyn,
 10.  idet vi Nat og Dag inderligt bede om at måtte få eder selv at se
      og råde Bod på eders Tros Mangler?

 11.  Men han selv, vor Gud og Fader, og vor Herre Jesus Kristus styre
      vor Vej til eder!
 12.  Men eder lade Herren vokse og blive overvættes rige i
      Kærligheden til hverandre og til alle, ligesom vi have den til
      eder,
 13.  så at han styrker eders Hjerter og gør dem udadlelige i
      Hellighed for Gud og vor Fader i vor Herres Jesu Tilkommelse med
      alle hans hellige!

1.Tessalonikerne 4

  1.  Så bede vi eder i øvrigt, Brødre! og formane eder i den Herre
      Jesus, at som I jo have lært af os, hvorledes I bør vandre og
      behage Gud, således som I jo også gøre, at I således må gøre end
      yderligere Fremgang.
  2.  I vide jo, hvilke Bud vi gave eder ved den Herre Jesus.
  3.  Thi dette er Guds Villie, eders Helliggørelse, at I afholde eder
      fra Utugt;
  4.  at hver af eder veed at vinde sig sin egen Hustru i Hellighed og
      Ære,
  5.  ikke i Begærings Brynde som Hedningerne, der ikke kende Gud;
  6.  at ingen foruretter og bedrager sin Broder i nogen Sag; thi
      Herren er en Hævner over alt dette, som vi også før have sagt og
      vidnet for eder.
  7.  Thi Gud kaldte os ikke til Urenhed, men til Helliggørelse.
  8.  Derfor altså, den, som foragter dette, han foragter ikke et
      Menneske, men Gud, som også giver sin Helligånd til eder.

  9.  Men om Broderkærligheden have I ikke nødig, at jeg skal skrive
      eder til; thi I ere selv oplærte af Gud til at elske hverandre;
 10.  det gøre I jo også imod alle Brødrene i hele Makedonien; men vi
      formane eder, Brødre! til yderligere Fremgang
 11.  og til at sætte en Ære i at leve stille og varetage hver sit og
      arbejde med eders Hænder, således som vi bød eder,
 12.  for at I kunne vandre sømmeligt over for dem, som ere udenfor,
      og for ikke at trænge til nogen.

 13.  Men vi ville ikke, Brødre! at I skulle være uvidende med Hensyn
      til dem, som sove hen, for at I ikke skulle sørge som de andre,
      der ikke have Håb.
 14.  Thi når vi tro, at Jesus er død og opstanden, da skal også Gud
      ligeså ved Jesus føre de hensovede frem med ham.
 15.  Thi dette sige vi eder med Herrens Ord, at vi levende, som blive
      tilbage til Herrens Tilkommelse, vi skulle ingenlunde komme
      forud for de hensovede.
 16.  Thi Herren selv skal stige ned fra Himmelen med et Tilråb, med
      Overengels Røst og med Guds Basun, og de døde i Kristus skulle
      opstå først;
 17.  derefter skulle vi levende, som blive tilbage, bortrykkes
      tillige med dem i Skyer til at møde Herren i Luften; og så
      skulle vi altid være sammen med Herren.
 18.  Så trøster hverandre med disse Ord!

1.Tessalonikerne 5

  1.  Men om Tid og Time, Brødre! have I ikke nødig, at der skrives
      til eder;
  2.  thi I vide selv grant, at Herrens Dag kommer som en Tyv om
      Natten.
  3.  Når de sige: "Fred og ingen Fare!" da kommer Undergang
      pludselig, over dem ligesom Veerne over den frugtsommelige, og
      de skulle ingenlunde undfly.
  4.  Men I, Brødre! I ere ikke i Mørke, så at Dagen skulde overraske
      eder som en Tyv.
  5.  Thi I ere alle Lysets Børn og Dagens Børn, vi ere ikke Nattens
      eller Mørkets Børn.
  6.  Så lader os da ikke sove ligesom de andre, men lader os våge og
      være ædrue!
  7.  Thi de, som sove, sove om Natten, og de, som beruse sig, ere
      berusede om Natten.
  8.  Men da vi høre Dagen til, så lader os være ædrue, iførte Troens
      og Kærlighedens Panser og Frelsens Håb som Hjelm!
  9.  Thi Gud bestemte os ikke til Vrede, men til at vinde Frelse ved
      vor Herre Jesus Kristus,
 10.  som døde for os, for at vi, hvad enten vi våge eller sove,
      skulle leve sammen med ham.
 11.  Formaner derfor hverandre og opbygger den ene den anden, ligesom
      I også gøre.

 12.  Men vi bede eder, Brødre! at I skønne på dem, som arbejde
      iblandt eder og ere eders Forstandere i Herren og påminde eder,
 13.  og agte dem højlig i Kærlighed for deres Gernings Skyld. Holder
      Fred med hverandre!
 14.  Og vi formane eder, Brødre! påminder de uskikkelige, trøster de
      modfaldne, tager eder af de skrøbelige, værer langmodige imod
      alle!
 15.  Ser til, at ingen gengælder nogen ondt med ondt; men stræber
      altid efter det gode, både imod hverandre og imod alle.
 16.  Værer altid glade,
 17.  beder uafladelig,
 18.  takker i alle Forhold; thi dette er Guds Villie med eder i
      Kristus Jesus.
 19.  Udslukker ikke Ånden,
 20.  ringeagter ikke Profetier,
 21.  prøver alt, beholder det gode!
 22.  Holder eder fra det onde under alle Skikkelser!

 23.  Men han selv, Fredens Gud, helliggøre eder ganske og aldeles, og
      gid eders Ånd og Sjæl og Legeme må bevares helt og holdent, uden
      Dadel i vor Herres Jesu Kristi Tilkommelse!
 24.  Trofast er han, som kaldte eder, han skal også gøre det.

 25.  Brødre! beder for os!
 26.  Hilser alle Brødrene med et helligt Kys!
 27.  Jeg besværger eder ved Herren, at dette Brev må blive oplæst for
      alle de hellige Brødre.
 28.  Vor Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde være med eder!


2.Tessalonikerne

2.Tessalonikerne 1

  1.  Paulus og Silvanus og Timotheus til Thessalonikernes Menighed i
      Gud vor Fader og den Herre Jesus Kristus:
  2.  Nåde være med eder og Fred fra Gud vor Fader og den Herre Jesus
      Kristus!

  3.  Vi ere skyldige altid at takke Gud for eder, Brødre! som
      tilbørligt er, fordi eders Tro vokser overmåde, og den indbyrdes
      Kærlighed forøges hos hver enkelt af eder alle,
  4.  så at vi selv rose os af eder i Guds Menigheder for eders
      Udholdenhed og Tro under alle eders Forfølgelser og de
      Trængsler, som I udstå,
  5.  et Bevis på Guds retfærdige Dom, for at I kunne agtes værdige
      til Guds Rige, for hvilket I også lide;
  6.  hvis ellers det er retfærdigt for Gud at give dem Trængsel til
      Gengæld, som trænge eder,
  7.  og eder, som trænges, Hvile med os ved den Herres Jesu
      Åbenbarelse fra Himmelen med sin Krafts Engle,
  8.  med Lueild, når han tager Hævn over dem, som ikke kende Gud, og
      over dem, som ikke lyde vor Herres Jesu Evangelium,
  9.  de, som jo skulle lide Straf, evig Undergang bort fra Herrens
      Ansigt og fra hans Vældes Herlighed.
 10.  når han kommer for på hin Dag at herliggøres i sine hellige og
      beundres i alle dem, som have troet; thi troet blev vort
      Vidnesbyrd til eder.

 11.  Derfor bede vi også altid for eder, at vor Gud vil agte eder
      Kaldelsen værdige og med Kraft fuldkomme al Lyst til det gode og
      Troens Gerning,
 12.  for at vor Herres Jesu Navn må herliggøres i eder, og I i ham.
      efter vor Guds og den Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde.

2.Tessalonikerne 2

  1.  Men vi bede eder, Brødre! angående vor Herres Jesu Kristi
      Tilkommelse og vor Samling til ham,
  2.  at I ikke i en Hast må lade eder bringe fra Besindelse eller
      forskrække hverken ved nogen Ånd eller ved nogen Tale eller
      Brev, der skulde være fra os, som om Herrens Dag var lige for
      Hånden.
  3.  Lad ingen bedrage eder i nogen Måde; thi først må jo Frafaldet
      komme og Syndens Menneske åbenbares, Fortabelsens Søn,
  4.  han, som sætter sig imod og ophøjer sig over alt. hvad der
      kaldes Gud eller Helligdom, så at han sætter sig i Guds Tempel
      og udgiver sig selv for at være Gud.
  5.  Komme I ikke i Hu, at jeg sagde eder dette, da jeg endnu var hos
      eder?
  6.  Og nu vide I, hvad der holder ham tilbage, indtil han åbenbares
      i sin Tid.
  7.  Thi Lovløshedens Hemmelighed virker allerede, kun at den, som nu
      holder tilbage, først må komme af Vejen
  8.  og da skal den lovløse åbenbares, hvem den Herre Jesus skal
      dræbe med sin Munds Ånde og tilintetgøre ved sin Tilkommelses
      Åbenbarelse,
  9.  han, hvis Komme sker ifølge Satans Kraft, med al Løgnens Magt og
      Tegn og Undere
 10.  og med alt Uretfærdigheds Bedrag for dem, som fortabes, fordi de
      ikke toge imod Kærligheden til Sandheden, så de kunde blive
      frelste.
 11.  Og derfor sender Gud dem kraftig Vildfarelse, så at de tro
      Løgnen,
 12.  for at de skulle dømmes, alle de, som ikke troede Sandheden, men
      fandt Behag i Uretfærdigheden.

 13.  Men vi ere skyldige at takke Gud altid for eder, I af Herren
      elskede Brødre! fordi Gud har udvalgt eder fra Begyndelsen til
      Frelse ved Åndens Helligelse og Tro på Sandheden,
 14.  hvortil han kaldte eder ved vort Evangelium, for at I skulde
      vinde vor Herres Jesu Kristi Herlighed.

 15.  Så står da fast, Brødre! og holder fast ved de Overleveringer,
      hvori I bleve oplærte, være sig ved vor Tale eller vort Brev.
 16.  Men han selv, vor Herre Jesus Kristus og Gud vor Fader, som har
      elsket og givet os en evig Trøst og et godt Håb i Nåde,
 17.  han trøste eders Hjerter og styrke eder i al god Gerning og
      Tale!

2.Tessalonikerne 3

  1.  I øvrigt, Brødre! beder for os, at Herrens Ord må have Løb og
      forherliges ligesom hos eder,
  2.  og at vi må fries fra de vanartige og onde Mennesker; thi Troen
      er ikke alles.
  3.  Men trofast er Herren, som skal styrke eder og bevare eder fra
      det onde;
  4.  og vi have den Tillid til eder i Herren, at I både gøre og ville
      gøre, hvad vi byde.
  5.  Men Herren styre eders Hjerter til Guds Kærlighed og til Kristi
      Udholdenhed!

  6.  Men vi byde eder, Brødre! i vor Herres Jesu Kristi Navn, at I
      holde eder borte fra enhver Broder, som vandrer uskikkeligt og
      ikke efter den Overlevering, som de modtoge af os.
  7.  I vide jo selv, hvorledes I bør efterfølge os. Thi vi have ikke
      levet uskikkeligt iblandt eder,
  8.  ikke heller spiste vi nogens Brød for intet, men arbejdede med
      Møje og Anstrengelse, Nat og Dag,for ikke at være nogen af eder
      til Byrde.
  9.  Ikke fordi vi ikke have Ret dertil; men vi vilde give eder et
      Forbillede i os selv, for at I skulde efterfølge os.
 10.  Også da vi vare hos eder, bød vi eder jo dette, at dersom nogen
      ikke vil arbejde, så skal han heller ikke have Føden!
 11.  Vi høre nemlig, at nogle vandre uskikkeligt iblandt eder, idet
      de ikke arbejde, men tage sig uvedkommende Ting for.
 12.  Sådanne byde og formane vi i den Herre Jesus Kristus, at de
      skulle arbejde i Stilhed og således spise deres eget Brød.
 13.  Men I, Brødre! bliver ikke trætte af at gøre det gode!
 14.  Men dersom nogen ikke lyder vort Ord her i Brevet, da mærker
      eder ham; hav intet Samkvem med ham, for at han må skamme sig!
 15.  Dog skulle I ikke agte ham for en Fjende, men påminde ham som en
      Broder!

 16.  Men han selv, Fredens Herre, give eder Freden altid, i alle
      Måder!  Herren være med eder alle!
 17.  Hilsenen med min, Paulus's, egen Hånd, hvilket er et Mærke i
      hvert Brev. Således skriver jeg.
 18.  Vor Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde være med eder alle!


1.Timoteus

1.Timoteus 1

  1.  Paulus, Kristi Jesu Apostel efter Befaling af Gud, vor Frelser,
      og Kristus Jesus, vort Håb,
  2.  til Timotheus, sit ægte Barn i Troen: Nåde, Barmhjertig Fred fra
      Gud Fader og Kristus Jesus vor Herre!

  3.  Det var derfor, jeg opfordrede dig til at blive i Efesus, da jeg
      drog til Makedonien, for at du skulde påbyde visse Folk ikke at
      føre fremmed Lære
  4.  og ikke at agte på Fabler og Slægtregistre uden Ende, som mere
      fremme Stridigheden end Guds Husholdning i Tro.
  5.  Men Påbudets Endemål er Kærlighed af et rent Hjerte og af en god
      Samvittighed og af en uskrømtet Tro,
  6.  hvorfra nogle ere afvegne og have vendt sig til intetsigende
      Snak,
  7.  idet de ville være Lovlærere uden at forstå, hverken hvad de
      sige, eller hvorom de udtale sig så sikkert.
  8.  Men vi vide, at Loven er god, dersom man bruger den lovmæssigt,
  9.  idet man veed dette, at Loven ikke er sat for den retfærdige,
      men for lovløse og ulydige, ugudelige og Syndere, ryggesløse og
      vanhellige, for dem, som øve Vold imod deres Fader og Moder, for
      Manddrabere,
 10.  utugtige, Syndere imod Naturen, Menneskerøvere, Løgnere,
      Menedere, og hvad andet der er imod den sunde Lære,
 11.  efter den salige Guds Herligheds Evangelium, som er blevet mig
      betroet.

 12.  Jeg takker ham, som gjorde mig stærk, Kristus Jesus, vor Herre,
      fordi han agtede mig for tro, idet han satte mig til en
      Tjeneste,
 13.  skønt jeg forhen var en Bespotter og en Forfølger og en
      Voldsmand; men der blev vist mig Barmhjertighed, thi jeg gjorde
      det vitterligt i Vantro,
 14.  Ja, vor Herres Nåde viste sig overvættes rig med Tro og
      Kærlighed i Kristus Jesus.
 15.  Den Tale er troværdig og al Modtagelse værd, at Kristus Jesus
      kom til Verden for at frelse Syndere, iblandt hvilke jeg er den
      største"
 16.  Men derfor blev der vist mig Barmhjertighed, for at Jesus
      Kristus kunde på mig som den første vise hele sin Langmodighed,
      til et Forbillede på dem, som skulle tro på ham til evigt Liv.
 17.  Men Evighedens Konge, den uforkrænkelige, usynlige, eneste Gud
      være Pris og Ære i Evighedernes Evigheder! Amen.

 18.  Dette Påbud betror jeg dig, mit Barn Timotheus, ifølge de
      Profetier, som tilforn ere udtalte over dig, at du efter dem
      strider den gode Strid,
 19.  idet du har Tro og en god Samvittighed, hvilken nogle have stødt
      fra sig og lidt Skibbrud på Troen;
 20.  iblandt dem ere Hymenæus og Aleksander, hvilke jeg har overgivet
      til Satan, for at de skulle tugtes til ikke at bespotte.

1.Timoteus 2

  1.  Jeg formaner da først af alt til, at der holdes Bønner,
      Påkaldelser, Forbønner, Taksigelser for alle Mennesker,
  2.  for Konger og alle dem, som ere i Højhed, at vi må leve et
      roligt og stille Levned i al Gudsfrygt og Ærbarhed;
  3.  dette er smukt og velbehageligt for Gud, vor Frelser,
  4.  som vil, at alle Mennesker skulle frelses og komme til Sandheds
      Erkendelse.
  5.  Thi der er een Gud, og også een Mellemmand imellem Gud og
      Mennesker, Mennesket Kristus Jesus,
  6.  som gav sig selv til en Genløsnings Betaling for alle, hvilket
      er Vidnesbyrdet i sin Tid,
  7.  og for dette er jeg bleven sat til Prædiker og Apostel (jeg
      siger Sandhed, jeg lyver ikke), en Lærer for Hedninger i Tro og
      Sandhed.

  8.  Så vil jeg da, at Mændene på ethvert Sted, hvor de bede, skulle
      opløfte fromme Hænder uden Vrede og Trætte.
  9.  Ligeså, at Kvinder skulle pryde sig i sømmelig Klædning med
      Blufærdighed og Ærbarhed, ikke med Fletninger og Guld eller
      Perler eller kostbar Klædning,
 10.  men, som det sømmer sig Kvinder, der bekende sig til Gudsfrygt,
      med gode Gerninger.
 11.  En Kvinde bør i Stilhed lade sig belære, med al Lydighed;
 12.  men at være Lærer tilsteder jeg ikke en Kvinde, ikke heller at
      byde over Manden, men at være i Stilhed.
 13.  Thi Adam blev dannet først, derefter Eva;
 14.  og Adam blev ikke bedraget, men Kvinden blev bedraget og er
      falden i Overtrædelse.
 15.  Men hun skal frelses igennem sin Barnefødsel, dersom de blive i
      Tro og Kærlighed og Hellighed med Ærbarhed.

1.Timoteus 3

  1.  Den Tale er troværdig; dersom nogen begærer en Tilsynsgerning
      har han Lyst til en skøn Gerning.
  2.  En Tilsynsmand bør derfor være ulastelig, een Kvindes Mand,
      ædruelig, sindig, høvisk, gæstfri, dygtig til at lære andre;
  3.  ikke hengiven til Vin, ikke til Slagsmål, men mild, ikke
      kivagtig, ikke pengegridsk;
  4.  en Mand, som forestår sit eget Hus vel, som har Børn, der ere
      lydige med al Ærbarhed;
  5.  (dersom en ikke veed at forestå sit eget Hus, hvorledes vil han
      da kunne sørge for Guds Menighed?)
  6.  ikke ny i Troen, som at han ikke skal blive opblæst og falde ind
      under Djævelens Dom.
  7.  Men han bør også have et godt Vidnesbyrd af dem, som ere
      udenfor; for at han ikke skal falde i Forhånelse og Djævelens
      Snare.

  8.  Menighedstjenere bør ligeledes være ærbare, ikke tvetungede,
      ikke hengivne til megen Vin, ikke til slet Vinding,
  9.  bevarende Troens Hemmelighed i en ren Samvittighed.
 10.  Men også disse skulle først prøves, og siden gøre Tjeneste, hvis
      de ere ustrafelige.
 11.  Kvinder bør ligeledes være ærbare, ikke bagtaleriske, ædruelige,
      tro i alle Ting.
 12.  En Menighedstjener skal være een Kvindes Mand og forestå sine
      Børn og sit eget Hus vel.
 13.  Thi de, som have tjent vel i Menigheden, de erhverve sig selv en
      smuk Stilling og megen Frimodighed i Troen på Kristus Jesus.

 14.  Disse Ting skriver jeg dig til, ihvorvel jeg håber at komme
      snart til dig;
 15.  men dersom jeg tøver, da skal du heraf vide, hvorledes man bør
      færdes i Guds Hus, hvilket jo er den levende Guds Menighed,
      Sandhedens Søjle og Grundvold.
 16.  Og uden Modsigelse stor er den Gudsfrygtens Hemmelighed: Han,
      som blev åbenbaret i Kød, blev retfærdiggjort i Ånd, set af
      Engle, prædiket iblandt Hedninger, troet i Verden, optagen i
      Herlighed.

1.Timoteus 4

  1.  Men Ånden siger klarlig, at i kommende Tider ville nogle falde
      fra Troen, idet de agte på forførende Ånder og på Dæmoners
      Lærdomme,
  2.  ved Løgnlæreres Hykleri, som ere brændemærkede i deres egen
      Samvittighed,
  3.  som byde, at man ikke må gifte sig, og at man skal afholde sig
      fra Spiser, hvilke Gud har skabt til at nydes med Taksigelse af
      dem, som tro og have erkendt Sandheden.
  4.  Thi al Guds Skabning er god, og intet er at forkaste, når det
      tages med Taksigelse;
  5.  thi det helliges ved Guds Ord og Bøn.

  6.  Når du foreholder Brødrene dette, er du en god Kristi Jesu
      Tjener, idet du næres ved Troens og den gode Læres Ord, den, som
      du har efterfulgt;
  7.  men afvis de vanhellige og kælingagtige Fabler! Derimod øv dig
      selv i Gudsfrygt!
  8.  Thi den legemlige Øvelse er nyttig til lidet, men Gudsfrygten er
      nyttig til alle Ting, idet den har Forjættelse for det Liv, som
      nu er, og for det, som kommer.
  9.  Den Tale er troværdig og al Modtagelse værd.
 10.  Thi derfor lide vi Møje og Forhånelser, fordi vi have sat vort
      Håb til den levende Gud, som er alle Menneskers Frelser, mest
      deres, som tro.
 11.  Påbyd og lær dette!

 12.  Lad ingen ringeagte dig for din Ungdoms Skyld, men bliv et
      Forbillede for dem, som tro, i Tale, i Vandel, i Kærlighed, i
      Tro, i Renhed!
 13.  Indtil jeg kommer, så giv Agt på Oplæsningen, Formaningen,
      Undervisningen.
 14.  Forsøm ikke den Nådegave, som er i dig, som blev given dig under
      Profeti med Håndspålæggelse af de Ældste.
 15.  Tænk på dette, lev i dette, for at din Fremgang må være åbenbar
      for alle.
 16.  Giv Agt på dig selv og på Undervisningen: hold ved dermed; thi
      når du gør dette,skal du frelse både dig selv og dem, som høre
      dig.

1.Timoteus 5

  1.  En gammel Mand må du ikke skælde på, men forman ham som en
      Fader, unge Mænd som Brødre,
  2.  gamle Kvinder som Mødre, unge som Søstre, i al Renhed.

  3.  Ær Enker, dem, som virkelig ere Enker;
  4.  men om en Enke har Børn eller Børnebørn, da lad dem først lære
      at vise deres eget Hus skyldig Kærlighed og gøre Gengæld imod
      Forældrene; thi dette er velbebageligt for Gud.
  5.  Men den, som virkelig er Enke og står ene, har sat sit Håb til
      Gud og bliver ved med sine Bønner og Påkaldelser Nat og Dag;
  6.  men den, som lever efter sine Lyster, er levende død.
  7.  Forehold dem også dette, for at de må være ulastelige.
  8.  Men dersom nogen ikke har Omsorg for sine egne og især for sine
      Husfæller, han har fornægtet Troen og er værre end en vantro.
  9.  En Enke kan udnævnes når hun er ikke yngre end tresindstyve År,
      har været een Mands Hustru,
 10.  har Vidnesbyrd for gode Gerninger, har opfostret Børn, har vist
      Gæstfrihed, har toet helliges Fødder, har hjulpet nødlidende,
      har lagt sig efter al god Gerning.
 11.  Men afvis unge Enker; thi når de i kødelig Attrå gøre Oprør imod
      Kristus, ville de giftes
 12.  og have så den Dom, at de have sveget deres første Tro.
 13.  Tilmed lære de, idet de løbe omkring i Husene, at være
      ørkesløse, og ikke alene ørkesløse, men også at være
      sladderagtige og blande sig i uvedkommende Ting, idet de tale,
      hvad der er utilbørligt.
 14.  Derfor vil jeg, at unge Enker skulle giftes, føde Børn, styre
      Hus, ingen Anledning give Modstanderen til slet Omtale.
 15.  Thi allerede have nogle vendt sig bort efter Satan.
 16.  Dersom nogen troende Kvinde har Enker, da lad hende hjælpe dem,
      og lad ikke Menigheden bebyrdes, for at den kan hjælpe de
      virkelige Enker.

 17.  De Ældste, som ere gode Forstandere, skal man holde dobbelt Ære
      værd, mest dem, som arbejde i Tale og Undervisning.
 18.  Thi Skriften siger: "Du må ikke binde Munden til på en Okse, som
      tærsker;" og: "Arbejderen er sin Løn værd."
 19.  Tag ikke imod noget Klagemål imod en Ældste, uden efter to eller
      tre Vidner.
 20.  Dem, som Synde, irettesæt dem for alles Åsyn, for at også de
      andre må have Frygt.
 21.  Jeg besværger dig for Guds og Kristi Jesu og de udvalgte Engles
      Åsyn, at du vogter på dette uden Partiskhed, så du intet gør
      efter Tilbøjelighed.
 22.  Vær ikke hastig til at lægge Hænder på nogen, og gør dig ikke
      delagtig i andres Synder; hold dig selv ren!
 23.  Drik ikke længere bare Vand, men nyd lidt Vin for din Mave og
      dine jævnlige Svagheder.
 24.  Nogle Menneskers Synder ere åbenbare og gå forud til Dom; men
      for nogle følge de også bagefter.
 25.  Ligeledes ere også de gode Gerninger åbenbare, og de, som det
      forholder sig anderledes med, kunne ikke skjules.

1.Timoteus 6

  1.  Alle de, som ere Trælle under Åg, skulle holde deres egne Herrer
      al Ære værd, for at ikke Guds Navn og Læren skal bespottes.
  2.  Men de, der have troende Herrer, må ikke ringeagte dem, fordi de
      ere Brødre, men tjene dem desto hellere, fordi de, som nyde godt
      af deres gode Gerning, ere troende og elskede. Lær dette, og
      forman dertil!

  3.  Dersom nogen fører fremmed Lære og ikke holder sig til vor
      Herres Jesu Kristi sunde Ord og til den Lære, som stemmer med
      Gudsfrygt.
  4.  han er opblæst, skønt han intet ved, men er syg for Stridigheder
      og Ordkampe, hvoraf kommer Avind, Kiv, Forhånelser, ond Mistanke
  5.  og idelige Rivninger hos Mennesker, som ere fordærvede i Sindet
      og berøvede Sandheden, idet de mene, at Gudsfrygten er en
      Vinding.
  6.  Vist nok er Gudsfrygten sammen med Nøjsomhed en stor Vinding.
  7.  Thi vi have intet bragt ind i Verden, det er da åbenbart, at vi
      ej heller kunne bringe noget ud derfra.
  8.  Men når vi have Føde og Klæder, ville vi dermed lade os nøje.
  9.  Men de, som ville være rige, falde i Fristelse og Snare og mange
      ufornuftige og skadelige Begæringer, som nedsænke Menneskene i
      Undergang og Fortabelse;
 10.  thi Pengegridskheden er en Rod til alt ondt; og ved at hige
      derefter ere nogle farne vild fra Troen og have gennemstunget
      sig selv med mange Smerter.

 11.  Men du, o Guds Menneske! fly disse Ting; jag derimod efter
      Retfærdighed, Gudsfrygt, Tro, Kærlighed, Udholdenhed,
      Sagtmodighed;
 12.  strid Troens gode Strid, grib det evige Liv, til hvilket du er
      bleven kaldet og har aflagt den gode Bekendelse for mange
      Vidner.
 13.  Jeg byder dig for Guds Åsyn, som holder alle Ting i Live, og for
      Kristus Jesus, som vidnede den gode Bekendelse for Pontius
      Pilatus,
 14.  at du holder Budet uplettet, ulasteligt indtil vor Herres Jesu
      Kristi Åbenbarelse,
 15.  hvilken den salige og alene mægtige, Kongernes Konge og
      Herrernes Herre skal lade til Syne i sin Tid;
 16.  han, som alene har Udødelighed, som bor i et utilgængeligt Lys,
      hvem intet Menneske har set, ikke heller kan se; ham være Ære og
      evig Magt! Amen!

 17.  Byd dem, som ere rige i den nærværende Verden, at de ikke
      hovmode sig, ej heller sætte Håb til den usikre Rigdom, men til
      Gud, som giver os rigeligt alle Ting at nyde;
 18.  at de gøre godt, ere rige på gode Gerninger, gerne give, meddele
 19.  og således, opsamle sig selv en god Grundvold for den kommende
      Tid, for at de kunne gribe det sande Liv.

 20.  O Timotheus! vogt på den betroede Skat, idet du vender dig bort
      fra den vanhellige, tomme Snak og Indvendingerne fra den
      falskelig såkaldte Erkendelse,
 21.  hvilken nogle have bekendt sig til og ere afvegne fra Troen.
      Nåden være med dig!


2.Timoteus

2.Timoteus 1

  1.  Paulus; Kristi Jesu Apostel ved Guds Villie, for at bringe
      Forjættelse om Livet i Kristus Jesus
  2.  - til Timotheus, sit elskede Barn: Nåde, Barmhjertighed og Fred
      fra Gud Fader og Kristus Jesus, vor Herre!

  3.  Jeg takker Gud, hvem jeg fra mine Forfædre af har tjent i en ren
      Samvittighed, ligesom jeg uafladelig har dig i Erindring i mine
      Bønner Nat og Dag,
  4.  da jeg i Mindet om dine Tårer længes efter at se dig, for at jeg
      må fyldes med Glæde,
  5.  idet jeg er bleven mindet om den uskrømtede Tro, som er i dig,
      den, som boede først i din Mormoder Lois og din Moder Eunike, og
      jeg er vis på, at den også bor i dig.

  6.  Derfor påminder jeg dig, at du opflammer den Guds Nådegave, som
      er i dig ved mine Hænders Pålæggelse.
  7.  Thi Gud har ikke givet os Fejgheds Ånd, men Krafts og Kærligheds
      og Sindigheds Ånd.
  8.  Derfor, skam dig ikke ved Vidnesbyrdet om vor Herre eller ved
      mig, hans Fange, men lid ondt med Evangeliet ved Guds Kraft,
  9.  han, som frelste os og kaldte os med en hellig Kaldelse, ikke
      efter vore Gerninger, men efter sit eget Forsæt og Nåden, som
      blev given os i Kristus Jesus fra evige Tider,
 10.  men nu er kommen for Dagen ved vor Frelsers Jesu Kristi
      Åbenbarelse, han, som tilintetgjorde Døden, men bragte Liv og
      Uforkrænkelighed for Lyset ved Evangeliet,
 11.  for hvilket jeg er bleven sat til Prædiker og Apostel og
      Hedningers Lærer,

 12.  hvorfor jeg også lider dette, men jeg skammer mig ikke derved;
      thi jeg ved, til hvem jeg har sat min Tro, og jeg er vis på, at
      han er mægtig til at vogte på den mig betroede Skat til hin Dag.
 13.  Hav et Forbillede i de sunde Ord, som du har hørt af mig, i Tro
      og Kærlighed i Kristus Jesus.
 14.  Vogt på den skønne betroede Skat ved den Helligånd, som bor i
      os.

 15.  Du ved dette, at alle de i Asien have vendt sig fra mig, iblandt
      hvilke ere Fygelus og Hermogenes.
 16.  Herren vise Onesiforus's Hus Barmhjertighed; thi han har ofte
      vederkvæget mig og skammede sig ikke ved min Lænke,
 17.  men da han kom til Rom, søgte han ivrigt efter mig og fandt mig.
 18.  Herren give ham at finde Barmhjertighed fra Herren på hin Dag!
      Og hvor megen Tjeneste han har gjort i Efesus, ved du bedst.

2.Timoteus 2

  1.  Du derfor, mit Barn! bliv stærk ved Nåden i Kristus Jesus;
  2.  og hvad du har hørt af mig for mange Vidner, betro det til
      trofaste Mennesker, som kunne være dygtige også til at lære
      andre.
  3.  Vær med til at lide ondt som en god Kristi Jesu Stridsmand.
  4.  Ingen, som gør Krigstjeneste, indvikler sig i Livets Handeler
      for at han kan behage den, som tog ham i Sold.
  5.  Og ligeså, når nogen møder i Væddekamp, bliver han dog ikke
      bekranset, dersom han ikke kæmper lovmæssigt.
  6.  Den Bonde, som arbejder, bør først have Del i Frugterne.
  7.  Mærk, hvad jeg siger; Herren vil jo give dig Indsigt i alle
      Ting.

  8.  Kom Jesus Kristus i Hu, oprejst fra de døde, af Davids Sæd,
      efter mit Evangelium,
  9.  for hvilket jeg lider ondt lige indtil at være bunden som en
      Misdæder; men Guds Ord er ikke bundet.
 10.  Derfor udholder jeg alt for de udvalgtes Skyld, for at også de
      skulle få Frelsen i Kristus Jesus med evig Herlighed.
 11.  Den Tale er troværdig; thi dersom vi ere døde med ham, skulle vi
      også leve med ham;
 12.  dersom vi holde ud, skulle vi også være Konger med ham; dersom
      vi fornægte, skal også han fornægte os;
 13.  dersom vi ere utro, forbliver han dog tro; thi fornægte sig selv
      kan han ikke.

 14.  påmind om disse Ting, idet du besværger dem for Herrens Åsyn, at
      de ikke kives om Ord, hvilket er til ingen Nytte, men til
      Ødelæggelse for dem, som høre derpå.
 15.  Gør dig Flid for at fremstille dig selv som prøvet for Gud, som
      en, Arbejder, der ikke behøver at skamme sig, som rettelig lærer
      Sandhedens Ord.
 16.  Men hold dig fra den vanhellige, tomme Snak; thi sådanne ville
      stedse gå videre i Ugudelighed,
 17.  og deres Ord vil æde om sig som Kræft. Iblandt dem ere Hymenæus
      og Filetus,
 18.  som ere afvegne fra Sandheden, idet de sige, at Opstandelsen er
      allerede sket, og de forvende Troen hos nogle.

 19.  Dog, Guds faste Grundvold står og har dette Segl: "Herren kender
      sine" og: "Hver den, som nævner Herrens Navn, afstå fra
      Uretfærdighed."
 20.  Men i et stort Hus er der ikke alene Kar af Guld og Sølv, men
      også af Træ og Ler, og nogle til Ære, andre til Vanære.
 21.  Dersom da nogen holder sig ren fra disse, han skal være et Kar
      til Ære, helliget, Husbonden nyttigt, tilberedt til al god
      Gerning.

 22.  Men fly de ungdommelige Begæringer; jag derimod efter
      Retfærdighed, Troskab, Kærlighed og Fred sammen med dem, som
      påkalde Herren af et rent Hjerte;
 23.  og afvis de tåbelige og uforstandige Stridigheder, efterdi du
      ved, at de avle Kampe,
 24.  men en Herrens Tjener bør ikke strides, men være mild imod alle,
      dygtig til at lære, i Stand til at tåle ondt,
 25.  med Sagtmodighed irettesættende dem, som modsætte sig, om Gud
      dog engang vilde give dem Omvendelse til Sandheds Erkendelse,
 26.  og de kunde blive ædru igen fra Djævelens Snare, af hvem de ere
      fangne til at gøre hans Villie.

2.Timoteus 3

  1.  Men vid dette,at i de sidste Dage skulle vanskelige Tider
      indtræde.
  2.  Thi Menneskene skulle være egenkærlige, pengegridske,
      praleriske, hovmodige, spottelystne, ulydige imod Forældre,
      utaknemmelige, ryggesløse,
  3.  ukærlige, uforligelige, bagtaleriske, uafholdne, rå, uden
      Kærlighed til det gode,
  4.  forræderske, fremfusende, opblæste, Mennesker, som mere elske
      Vellyst, end de elske Gud,
  5.  som have Gudfrygtigheds Skin, men have fornægtet dens Kraft. Og
      fra disse skal du vende dig bort!
  6.  Thi til dem høre de, som snige sig ind i Husene og fange
      Kvindfolk, der ere belæssede med Synder og drives af mange Hånde
      Begæringer
  7.  og altid lære og aldrig kunne komme til Sandheds Erkendelse.
  8.  Men ligesom Jannes og Jambres stode Moses imod, således modstå
      også disse Sandheden: Mennesker, fordærvede i Sindet,
      forkastelige i Troen.
  9.  Dog, de skulle ikke få Fremgang ydermere; thi deres Afsind skal
      blive åbenbart for alle, ligesom også hines blev.

 10.  Du derimod har efterfulgt mig i Lære, i Vandel, i Forsæt, Tro,
      Langmodighed, Kærlighed, Udholdenhed,
 11.  i Forfølgelser, i Lidelser, sådanne, som ere komne over mig i
      Antiokia, i Ikonium, i Lystra, sådanne Forfølgelser, som jeg har
      udstået, og Herren har friet mig ud af dem alle.
 12.  Ja, også alle de, som ville leve gudfrygtigt i Kristus Jesus,
      skulle forfølges.
 13.  Men onde Mennesker og Bedragere ville gå frem til det værre; de
      forføre og forføres.

 14.  Du derimod, bliv i det, som du har lært, og som du er bleven
      forvisset om, efterdi du ved, af hvem du har lært det,
 15.  og efterdi du fra Barn af kender de hellige Skrifter, som kunne
      gøre dig viis til Frelse ved Troen på Kristus Jesus.
 16.  Hvert Skrift er indåndet af Gud og nyttig til Belæring, til
      Irettesættelse, til Forbedring, til Optugtelse i Retfærdighed,
 17.  for at Guds-Mennesket må vorde fuldkomment, dygtiggjort til al
      god Gerning.

2.Timoteus 4

  1.  Jeg besværger dig for Guds og Kristi Jesu Åsyn, som skal dømme
      levende og døde, og ved hans Åbenbarelse og hans Rige:
  2.  Prædike Ordet, vær rede i Tide og i Utide, irettesæt, straf,
      forman med al Langmodighed og Belæring!
  3.  Thi den Tid skal komme, da de ikke skulle fordrage den sunde
      Lære, men efter deres egne Begæringer tage sig selv Lærere i
      Hobetal, efter hvad der kildrer deres Øren,
  4.  og de skulle vende Ørene fra Sandheden og vende sig hen til
      Fablerne.
  5.  Du derimod, vær ædru i alle Ting, lid ondt, gør en Evangelists
      Gerning, fuldbyrd din Tjeneste!

  6.  Thi jeg ofres allerede, og Tiden til mit Opbrud er for Hånden.
  7.  Jeg har stridt den gode Strid, fuldkommet Løbet og bevaret
      Troen.
  8.  I øvrigt henligger Retfærdighedens Krans til mig, hvilken
      Herren, den retfærdige Dommer, skal give mig på hin Dag, og ikke
      alene mig, men også alle dem, som have elsket hans Åbenbarelse.

  9.  Gør dig Flid for at komme snart til mig;
 10.  thi Demas forlod mig, fordi han fik Kærlighed til den nærværende
      Verden, og drog til Thessalonika; Kreskens drog til Galatien,
      Titus til Dalmatien.
 11.  Lukas er alene hos mig. Tag Markus og bring ham med dig; thi han
      er mig nyttig til Tjenesten.
 12.  Men Tykikus har jeg sendt til Efesus.
 13.  Når du kommer, da bring min Rejsekjortel med dig, som jeg lod
      blive i Troas hos Karpus, og Bøgerne, især dem på Pergament.

 14.  Smeden Aleksander har gjort mig meget ondt; Herren vil betale
      ham efter hans Gerninger.
 15.  For ham skal også du vogte dig; thi han stod vore Ord hårdt imod.
 16.  Ved mit første Forsvar kom ingen mig til Hjælp, men alle lode
      mig i Stikken; (gid det ikke må tilregnes dem! )
 17.  Men Herren stod hos mig og styrkede mig, for at Ordets Prædiken
      skulde fuldbyrdes ved mig, og alle Hedningerne høre det; og jeg
      blev friet fra Løvens Gab.
 18.  Herren vil fri mig fra al ond Gerning og frelse mig til sit
      himmelske Rige; ham være Æren i Evighedernes Evigheder! Amen.

 19.  Hils Priska og Akvila og Onesiforus's Hus!
 20.  Erastus blev i Korinth, men Trofimmus efterlod jeg syg i Milet.
 21.  Gør dig Flid for at komme før Vinteren! Eubulus og Pudens og
      Linus og Klaudia og alle Brødrene hilse dig.
 22.  Den Herre Jesus være med din Ånd! Nåden være med eder!


Titus

Titus 1

  1.  Paulus, Guds Tjener og Jesu Kristi Apostel til at virke Tro hos
      Guds udvalgte og Erkendelse at Sandheden angående Gudsfrygt,
  2.  i Håb om evigt Liv, hvilket Gud, som ikke lyver, har forjættet
      fra evige Tider,
  3.  men i sin Tid har han åbenbaret sit Ord ved den Prædiken, som er
      bleven mig betroet efter Guds, vor Frelsers Befaling:
  4.  til Titus, mit ægte Barn i fælles Tro: Nåde og Fred fra Gud
      Fader og Kristus Jesus vor Frelser!

  5.  Derfor efterlod jeg dig på Kreta, for at du skulde bringe i
      Orden, hvad der stod tilbage, og indsætte Ældste i hver By, som
      jeg pålagde dig,
  6.  såfremt en er ustraffelig, een Kvindes Mand og har troende Børn,
      der ikke ere beskyldte for Ryggesløshed eller ere genstridige.
  7.  Thi en Tilsynsmand bør være ustraffelig som en Guds Husholder,
      ikke selvbehagelig, ikke vredagtig, ikke hengiven til Vin, ikke
      til Slagsmål, ikke til slet Vinding,
  8.  men gæstfri, elskende det gode, sindig, retfærdig, from,
      afholdende;
  9.  en Mand, som holder fast ved det troværdige Ord efter Læren, for
      at han kan være dygtig til både at formane ved den sunde Lære og
      at gendrive dem, som sige imod.

 10.  Thi mange ere genstridige, føre intetsigende Snak og dåre
      Sindet, især de af Omskærelsen;
 11.  dem bør man stoppe Munden på; thi de forvende hele Huse ved at
      føre utilbørlig Lære for slet Vindings Skyld.
 12.  En af dem, en af deres egne Profeter, har sagt: "Kretere ere
      altid Løgnere, onde Dyr, lade Buge."
 13.  Dette Vidnesbyrd er sandt. Derfor skal du sætte dem strengelig i
      Rette, for at de må blive sunde i Troen
 14.  og ikke agte på jødiske Fabler og Bud af Mennesker, som vende
      sig bort fra Sandheden.
 15.  Alt er rent for de rene; men for de besmittede og vantro er
      intet rent, men både deres Sind og Samvittighed er besmittet.
 16.  De sige, at de kende Gud, men med deres Gerninger fornægte de
      ham, vederstyggelige, som de ere, og ulydige og uduelige til al
      god Gerning.

Titus 2

  1.  Du derimod, tal, hvad der sømmer sig for den sunde Lære:
  2.  at gamle Mænd skulle være ædruelige, ærbare, sindige, sunde i
      Troen, i Kærligheden, i Udholdenheden;
  3.  at gamle Kvinder ligeledes skulle skikke sig, som det sømmer sig
      hellige, ikke bagtale, ikke være forfaldne til megen Vin, men
      være Lærere i, hvad godt er,
  4.  for at de må få de unge Kvinder til at besinde sig på at elske
      deres Mænd og at elske deres Børn,
  5.  at være sindige, kyske, huslige, gode, deres egne Mænd
      undergivne, for at Guds Ord ikke skal bespottes.
  6.  Forman ligeledes de unge Mænd til at være sindige,
  7.  idet du i alle Måder viser dig selv som et Forbillede på gode
      Gerninger og i Læren viser Ufordærvethed, Ærbarhed,
  8.  sund, ulastelig Tale, for at Modstanderen må blive til Skamme,
      når han intet ondt har at sige om os.
  9.  Forman Trælle til at underordne sig under deres egne Herrer, at
      være dem til Behag i alle Ting, ikke sige imod,
 10.  ikke besvige, men vise al god Troskab, for at de i alle Måder
      kunne være en Pryd for Guds, vor Frelsers Lære.

 11.  Thi Guds Nåde er bleven åbenbaret til Frelse for alle Mennesker
 12.  og opdrager os til at forsage Ugudeligheden og de verdslige
      Begæringer og leve sindigt og retfærdigt og gudfrygtigt i den
      nærværende Verden;
 13.  forventende det salige Håb og den store Guds og vor Frelsers
      Jesu Kristi Herligheds Åbenbarelse,
 14.  han, som gav sig selv for os, for at han måtte forløse os fra al
      Lovløshed og rense sig selv et Ejendomsfolk, nidkært til gode
      Gerninger.
 15.  Tal dette, og forman og irettesæt med al Myndighed; lad ingen
      ringeagte dig!

Titus 3

  1.  Påmind dem om at underordne sig Øvrigheder og Myndigheder, at
      adlyde, at være redebonne til al god Gerning.
  2.  ikke at forhåne nogen, ikke være stridslystne, men milde, og
      udvise al Sagtmodighed imod alle Mennesker.

  3.  Thi også vi vare fordum uforstandige, ulydige, vildfarende,
      Slaver af Begæringer og, mange Hånde Lyster, vi levede i Ondskab
      og Avind, vare forhadte og hadede hverandre.
  4.  Men da Guds, vor Frelsers Godhed og Menneskekærlighed
      åbenbaredes,
  5.  frelste han os, ikke for de Retfærdigheds Gerningers Skyld, som
      vi havde gjort, men efter sin Barmhjertighed, ved Igenfødelsens
      Bad og Fornyelsen i den Helligånd,
  6.  som han rigeligt udøste over os ved Jesus Kristus, vor Frelser,
  7.  for at vi, retfærdiggjorte ved hans Nåde, skulde i Håb vorde
      Arvinger til evigt Liv.
  8.  Den Tale er troværdig, og derom vil jeg, at du skal forsikre
      dem, for at de, som ere komne til Tro på Gud, skulle lægge Vind
      på at øve gode Gerninger. Dette er Menneskene godt og nyttigt.

  9.  Men hold dig fra tåbelige Stridigheder og Slægtregistre og Kiv
      og Kampe om Loven; thi de ere unyttige og frugtesløse.
 10.  Et kættersk Menneske skal du afvise efter een og to Ganges
      Påmindelse,
 11.  da du ved, at en sådan er forvendt og synder, domfældt af sig
      selv.

 12.  Når jeg sender Artemas til dig eller Tykikus, da gør dig Flid
      for at komme til mig i Nikopolis;thi der har jeg besluttet at
      overvintre.
 13.  Zenas den lovkyndige og Apollos skal du omhyggeligt hjælpe på
      Vej, for at intet skal fattes dem.
 14.  Men lad også vore lære at øve gode Gerninger, hvor der er Trang
      dertil, for at de ikke skulle være uden Frugt.
 15.  Alle, som ere hos mig, hilse dig. Hils dem, som elske os i
      Troen.  Nåden være med eder alle!


Filemon 1

  1.  Paulus, Kristi Jesu Fange, og Broderen Timotheus til Filemon,
      vor elskede og Medarbejder,
  2.  og til Søsteren Appia og Arkippus, vor Medstrider, og Menigheden
      i dit Hus;
  3.  Nåde være med eder og Fred fra Gud vor Fader og den Herre Jesus
      Kristus!

  4.  Jeg takker min Gud altid, når jeg kommer dig i Hu i mine Bønner,
  5.  efterdi jeg hører om din Kærlighed og den Tro, som du har til
      den Herre Jesus og til alle de hellige,
  6.  for at din Delagtighed i Troen må blive virksom for Kristus i
      Erkendelse af alt det gode, som er i eder.
  7.  Thi stor Glæde og Trøst har jeg fået af din Kærlighed, efterdi
      de helliges Hjerter ere blevne vederkvægede ved dig, Broder!

  8.  Derfor, endskønt jeg kunde med stor Frimodighed i Kristus befale
      dig det, som er tilbørligt,
  9.  så beder jeg dig dog hellere for Kærlighedens Skyld, sådan som
      jeg er, som den gamle Paulus, og nu tilmed Kristi Jesu Fange;
 10.  jeg beder dig for mit Barn, som jeg har avlet i mine Lænker,
      Onesimus,
 11.  ham, som tilforn var dig unyttig, men nu er nyttig både for dig
      og for mig, ham, som jeg sender dig tilbage,
 12.  ham, det er mit eget Hjerte.
 13.  Ham vilde jeg gerne beholde hos mig, for at han i dit Sted kunde
      tjene mig i Evangeliets Lænker.
 14.  Men, uden dit Samtykke vilde jeg intet gøre, for at din Godhed
      ikke skulde være som af Tvang, men af fri Villie.
 15.  Thi måske blev han derfor skilt fra dig en liden Tid, for at du
      kunde få ham igen til evigt Eje,
 16.  ikke mere som en Træl, men som mere end en Træl, som en elsket
      Broder, særlig for mig, men hvor meget mere for dig, både i
      Kødet og i Herren.
 17.  Dersom da du anser mig for din Medbroder, så modtag ham som mig!
 18.  Men har han gjort dig nogen Uret eller er dig noget skyldig, da
      før mig det til Regning!
 19.  Jeg, Paulus, skriver med min egen Hånd, jeg vil betale,for ikke
      at sige dig, at du desuden også skylder mig dig selv.
 20.  Ja, Broder! lad mig få Gavn af dig i Herren, vederkvæg mit
      Hjerte i Kristus!

 21.  I Tillid til din Lydighed skriver jeg til dig, idet jeg ved, at
      du vil gøre endog mere end det, jeg siger.
 22.  Men med det samme bered også Herberge for mig; thi jeg håber, at
      jeg ved eders Bønner skal skænkes eder.
 23.  Epafras, min medfangne i Kristus Jesus,
 24.  Markus, Aristarkus, Demas, Lukas, mine Medarbejdere, hilse dig.
 25.  Vor Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde være med eders Ånd!


Hebræerne

Hebræerne 1

  1.  Efter at Gud fordum havde talt mange Gange og på mange Måder,
      til Fædrene ved Profeterne, så har han ved Slutningen af disse
      Dage talt til os ved sin Søn,
  2.  hvem han har sat til Arving af alle Ting, ved hvem han også har
      skabt Verden;
  3.  han, som - efterdi han er hans Herligheds Glans og hans Væsens
      udtrykte Billede og bærer alle Ting med sin Krafts Ord - efter
      at have gjort Renselse fra Synderne har sat sig ved Majestætens
      højre Hånd i det høje,
  4.  idet han er bleven så meget ypperligere end Englene, som han har
      arvet et herligere Navn fremfor dem.

  5.  Thi til hvilken af Englene sagde han nogen Sinde: "Du er min
      Søn, jeg har født dig i Dag"? og fremdeles: "Jeg skal være ham
      en Fader, og han skal være mig en Søn"?
  6.  Og når han atter indfører den førstefødte i Verden, hedder det:
      "Og alle Guds Engle skulle tilbede ham".
  7.  Og om Englene hedder det: "Han gør sine Engle til Vinde og sine
      Tjenere til Ildslue";
  8.  men om Sønnen,: "Din Trone, o Gud! står i al Evighed, og Rettens
      Kongestav er dit Riges Kongestav.
  9.  Du elskede Retfærdighed og hadede Lovløshed, derfor har Gud, din
      Gud, salvet dig med Glædens Olie fremfor dine Medbrødre".
 10.  Og: "Du, Herre! har i Begyndelsen grundfæstet Jorden, og Himlene
      ere dine Hænders Gerninger.
 11.  De skulle forgå, men du bliver; og de skulle til Hobe ældes som
      et Klædebon,
 12.  ja, som et Klæde skal du sammenrulle dem, og de skulle
      omskiftes; men du er den samme, og dine År skulle ikke få Ende".
 13.  Men til hvilken af Englene sagde han nogen Sinde: "Sæt dig ved
      min højre Hånd, indtil jeg får lagt dine Fjender som en Skammel
      for dine Fødder"?
 14.  Ere de ikke alle tjenende Ånder, som udsendes til Hjælp for
      deres Skyld, der skulle arve Frelse?

Hebræerne 2

  1.  Derfor bør vi des mere agte på det, vi have hørt, for at vi ikke
      skulle rives bort.
  2.  Thi når det Ord, som taltes ved Engle, blev urokket, og hver
      Overtrædelse og Ulydighed f1k velforskyldt Løn,
  3.  hvorledes skulle da vi undfly, når vi ikke bryde os om så stor
      en Frelse, som jo efter først at være bleven forkyndt ved
      Herren, er bleven stadfæstet for os af dem, som havde hørt ham,
  4.  idet Gud vidnede med både ved Tegn og Undere og mange Hånde
      kraftige Gerninger og ved Meddelelse af den Helligånd efter sin
      Villie.

  5.  Thi det var ikke Engle, han underlagde den kommende Verden; om
      hvilken vi tale.
  6.  Men en har vidnet et Sted og sagt: "Hvad er et Menneske, at du
      kommer ham i Hu? eller en Menneskesøn, at du ser til ham?
  7.  Du gjorde ham en kort Tid ringere end Engle; med Herlighed og
      Ære kronede du ham;
  8.  alle Ting lagde du under hans Fødder". - Idet han nemlig
      underlagde ham alle Ting, undtog han intet fra at være ham
      underlagt. Nu se vi imidlertid endnu ikke alle Ting underlagte
      ham;
  9.  men ham, som en kort Tid var bleven gjort ringere end Engle,
      Jesus, se vi på Grund af Dødens Lidelse kronet med Herlighed og
      Ære, for at han ved Guds Nåde må have smagt Døden for alle.

 10.  Thi det sømmede sig ham, for hvis Skyld alle Ting ere, og ved
      hvem alle Ting ere, når han førte mange Sønner til Herlighed, da
      at fuldkomme deres Frelses Ophavsmand igennem Lidelser.
 11.  Thi både den, som helliger, og de, som helliges, ere alle af
      een; hvorfor han ikke skammer sig ved at kalde dem Brødre,
 12.  når han siger: "Jeg vil forkynde dit Navn for mine Brødre, midt
      i en Menighed vil jeg lovsynge dig."
 13.  Og fremdeles: "Jeg vil forlade mig på ham." Og fremdeles: "Se,
      her er jeg og de Børn, som Gud har givet mig."
 14.  Efterdi da Børnene ere delagtige i Blod og Kød, blev også han i
      lige Måde delagtig deri, for at han ved Døden skulde gøre den
      magtesløs, som har Dødens Vælde, det er Djævelen,
 15.  og befri alle dem, som på Grund af Dødsfrygt vare under Trældom
      al deres Livs Tid.
 16.  Thi det er jo dog ikke Engle, han tager sig af, men Abrahams Sæd
      tager han sig af.
 17.  Derfor måtte han blive sine Brødre lig i alle. Ting, for at han
      kunde blive en barmhjertig og trofast Ypperstepræst over for Gud
      til at sone Folkets Synder.
 18.  Thi idet han har lidt, kan han som den, der selv er fristet,
      komme dem til Hjælp, som fristes.

Hebræerne 3

  1.  Derfor, hellige Brødre, delagtige i en himmelsk Kaldelse! ser
      hen til vor Bekendelses Udsending og Ypperstepræst, Jesus,
  2.  der var tro imod den, som beskikkede ham, ligesom også Moses var
      det i hele hans Hus.
  3.  Thi han er kendt værdig til større Herlighed end Moses, i samme
      Mål som den,der har indrettet et Hus, har større Ære end Huset
      selv.
  4.  Thi hvert Hus indrettes af nogen; men den, som har indrettet
      alt, er Gud.
  5.  Og Moses var vel tro i hele hans Hus, som en Tjener, til
      Vidnesbyrd om, hvad der skulde tales;
  6.  men Kristus er det som en Søn over hans Hus; og hans Hus ere vi,
      såfremt vi fastholde Håbets Frimodighed og Ros urokket indtil
      Enden.

  7.  Derfor, som den Helligånd siger: "I Dag, når I høre hans Røst,
  8.  da forhærder ikke eders Hjerter, som det skete i Forbitrelsen,
      på Fristelsens Dag i Ørkenen,
  9.  hvor eders Fædre fristede mig ved at sætte mig på Prøve, og de
      så dog mine Gerninger i fyrretyve År.
 10.  Derfor harmedes jeg på denne Slægt og sagde: De fare altid vild
      i Hjertet; men de kendte ikke mine Veje,
 11.  så jeg svor i min Vrede: Sandelig, de skulle ikke gå ind til min
      Hvile" -
 12.  så ser til, Brødre! at der ikke nogen Sinde i nogen af eder skal
      findes et ondt, vantro Hjerte, så at han falder fra den levende
      Gud.
 13.  Men formaner hverandre hver Dag, så længe det hedder "i Dag",
      for at ikke nogen af eder skal forhærdes ved Syndens Bedrag.
 14.  Thi vi ere blevne delagtige i Kristus, såfremt vi fastholde vor
      første Fortrøstning urokket indtil Enden.
 15.  Når der sigs: "I Dag, - når I høre hans Røst, da forhærder ikke
      eders Hjerter som i Forbitrelsen":
 16.  hvem vare da vel de, som hørte og dog voldte Forbitrelse? Mon
      ikke alle, som gik ud af Ægypten ved Moses?
 17.  Men på hvem harmedes han i fyrretyve År? Mon ikke på dem, som
      syndede, hvis døde Kroppe faldt i Ørkenen?
 18.  Og over for hvem tilsvor han, at de ikke skulde gå ind til hans
      Hvile, uden dem, som vare blevne genstridige?
 19.  Og vi se, at de ikke kunde gå ind på Grund af Vantro.

Hebræerne 4

  1.  Lader os derfor, da der endnu står en Forjættelse tilbage om at
      indgå til hans Hvile, vogte os for, at nogen af eder skal mene,
      at han er kommen for silde.
  2.  Thi også os er der forkyndt godt Budskab ligesom hine; men
      Ordet, som de hørte, hjalp ikke dem, fordi det ikke var forenet
      med Troen hos dem, som hørte det.
  3.  Thi vi gå ind til Hvilen, vi, som ere komne til Troen, efter
      hvad han har sagt: "Så svor jeg i min Vrede: Sandelig, de skulle
      ikke gå ind til min Hvile", omendskønt Gerningerne vare
      fuldbragte fra Verdens Grundlæggelse.
  4.  Thi han har et Sted sagt om den syvende Dag således: "Og Gud
      hvilede på den syvende Dag fra alle sine Gerninger."
  5.  Og fremdeles på dette Sted: "Sandelig, de skulle ikke gå ind til
      min Hvile."
  6.  Efterdi der altså står tilbage, at nogle skulle gå ind til den,
      og de, hvem der først blev forkyndt godt Budskab, ikke gik ind
      for deres Genstridigheds Skyld:
  7.  så bestemmer han atter en Dag: "I Dag", siger han ved David så
      lang Tid efter, (som ovenfor sagt): "I Dag, når I høre hans
      Røst, da forhærder ikke eders Hjerter!"
  8.  Thi dersom Josva havde skaffet dem Hvile, da vilde han ikke tale
      om en anden Dag siden efter.
  9.  Altså er der en Sabbatshvile tilbage for Guds Folk.
 10.  Thi den, som er gået ind til hans Hvile, også han har fået Hvile
      fra sine Gerninger, ligesom Gud fra sine.

 11.  Lader os derfor gøre os Flid for at gå ind til hin Hvile, for at
      ikke nogen skal falde ved den samme Genstridighed, som hine gave
      Eksempel på.
 12.  Thi Guds Ord er levende og kraftigt og skarpere end noget
      tveægget Sværd og trænger igennem, indtil det deler Sjæl og Ånd,
      Ledemod såvel som Marv, og dømmer over Hjertets Tanker og Råd.
 13.  Og ingen Skabning er usynlig for hans Åsyn; men alle Ting ere
      nøgne og udspændte for hans Øjne, hvem vi stå til Regnskab.

 14.  Efterdi vi altså have en stor Ypperstepræst, som er gået igennem
      Himlene, Jesus, Guds Søn, da lader os holde fast ved
      Bekendelsen!
 15.  Thi vi have ikke en Ypperstepræst, som ej kan have Medlidenhed
      med vore Skrøbeligheder, men en sådan, som er fristet i alle
      Ting i Lighed med os, dog uden Synd.
 16.  Derfor lader os træde frem med Frimodighed for Nådens Trone, for
      at vi kunne få Barmhjertighed og finde Nåde til betimelig Hjælp.

Hebræerne 5

  1.  Thi hver Ypperstepræst tages iblandt Mennesker og indsættes for
      Mennesker til Tjenesten for Gud, for at han skal frembære både
      Gaver og Slagtofre for Synder,
  2.  som en, der kan bære over med de vankundige og vildfarende,
      eftersom han også selv er stedt i Skrøbelighed
  3.  og for dens Skyld må frembære Syndoffer, som for Folket således
      også for sig selv
  4.  Og ingen tager sig selv den Ære, men han kaldes af Gud, ligesom
      jo også Aron.

  5.  Således har ej heller Kristus tillagt sig selv den Ære at blive
      Ypperstepræst, men den, som sagde til ham: "Du er min Søn, jeg
      har født dig i Dag,"
  6.  som han jo også siger et andet Sted: "Du er Præst til evig Tid,
      efter Melkisedeks Vis,"
  7.  han, som i sit Køds Dage med stærkt Råb og Tårer frembar Bønner
      og ydmyge Begæringer til den, der kunde frelse ham fra Døden, og
      blev bønhørt i sin Angst,
  8.  og således, endskønt han var Søn, lærte Lydighed af det, han
      led,
  9.  og efter at være fuldkommet blev Årsag til evig Frelse for alle
      dem, som lyde ham,
 10.  idet han af Gud blev kaldt Ypperstepræst efter Melkisedeks Vis.

 11.  Herom have vi meget at sige, og det er vanskeligt at forklare,
      efterdi I ere blevne sløve til at høre.
 12.  Thi skønt I efter Tiden endog burde være Lærere, trænge I atter
      til, at man skal lære eder Begyndelsesgrundene i Guds Ord, og I
      ere blevne sådanne, som trænge til Mælk og ikke til fast Føde.
 13.  Thi hver, som får Mælk, er ukyndig i den rette Tale, thi han er
      spæd;
 14.  men for de fuldkomne er den faste Føde, for dem, som på Grund af
      deres Erfaring have Sanserne øvede til at skelne mellem godt og
      ondt.

Hebræerne 6

  1.  Lader os derfor forbigå Begyndelsesordet om Kristus og skride
      frem til Fuldkommenhed uden atter at lægge Grundvold med
      Omvendelse fra døde Gerninger og med Tro på Gud,
  2.  med Lære om Døbelser og Håndspålæggelse og dødes Opstandelse og
      evig Dom.
  3.  Ja, dette ville vi gøre, såfremt Gud tilsteder det.
  4.  Thi dem, som een Gang ere blevne oplyste og have smagt den
      himmelske Gave og ere blevne delagtige i den Helligånd
  5.  og have smagt Guds gode Ord og den kommende Verdens Kræfter, og
      som ere faldne fra, - dem er det umuligt atter at forny til
      Omvendelse
  6.  da de igen korsfæste sig Guds Søn og stille ham til Spot.
  7.  Thi Jorden, som drikker den ofte derpå faldende Regn og
      frembringer Vækster, tjenlige for dem, for hvis Skyld den også
      dyrkes, får Velsignelse fra Gud;
  8.  men når den bærer Torne og Tidsler, er den ubrugbar og
      Forbandelse nær; Enden med den er at brændes.

  9.  Dog, i Henseende til eder, I elskede! ere vi overbeviste om det
      bedre og det, som bringer Frelse, selv om vi tale således.
 10.  Thi Gud er ikke uretfærdig, så at han skulde glemme eders
      Gerning og den Kærlighed, som I have udvist imod hans Navn, idet
      I have tjent og tjene de hellige.
 11.  Men vi ønske, at enhver af eder må udvise den samme Iver efter
      den fulde Vished i Håbet indtil Enden,
 12.  for at I ikke skulle blive sløve, men efterfølge dem, som ved
      Tro og Tålmodighed arve Forjættelserne.
 13.  Thi da Gud gav Abraham Forjættelsen, svor han ved sig selv,
      fordi han ingen større havde at sværge ved, og sagde:
 14.  "Sandelig, jeg vil rigeligt velsigne dig og rigeligt
      mangfoldiggøre dig."
 15.  Og således opnåede han Forjættelsen ved at vente tålmodigt.
 16.  Mennesker sværge jo ved en større, og Eden er dem en Ende på al
      Modsigelse til Stadfæstelse.
 17.  Derfor, da Gud ydermere vilde vise Forjættelsens Arvinger sit
      Råds Uforanderlighed, føjede han en Ed dertil,
 18.  for at vi ved to uforanderlige Ting, i hvilke det var umuligt,
      at Gud kunde lyve, skulde have en kraftig Opmuntring, vi, som
      ere flyede hen for at holde fast ved det Håb, som ligger foran
      os,
 19.  hvilket vi have som et Sjælens Anker, der er sikkert og fast og
      går ind inden for Forhænget,
 20.  hvor Jesus som Forløber gik ind for os, idet han efter
      Melkisedeks Vis blev Ypperstepræst til evig Tid.

Hebræerne 7

  1.  Thi denne Melkisedek, Konge i Salem, den højeste Guds Præst, som
      gik Abraham i Møde, da han vendte tilbage fra Kongernes
      Nederlag, og velsignede ham,
  2.  hvem også Abraham gav Tiende af alt, og som, når hans Navn
      udlægges, først er Retfærdigheds Konge, dernæst også Salems
      Konge, det er: Freds Konge,
  3.  uden Fader, uden Moder, uden Slægtregister, uden Dages
      Begyndelse og uden Livs Ende, men gjort lig med Guds Søn, - han
      forbliver Præst for bestandig.

  4.  Ser dog, hvor stor denne er, hvem endog Patriarken Abraham gav
      Tiende af Byttet.
  5.  Og hine, som, idet de høre til Levi Sønner, få Præstedømmet,
      have et Bud om at tage Tiende efter Loven af Folket, det er af
      deres Brødre, endskønt disse ere udgåede af Abrahams Lænd;
  6.  men han, som ikke regner sin Slægt fra dem, har taget Tiende af
      Abraham og har velsignet den, som havde Forjættelserne.
  7.  Men uden al Modsigelse er det den ringere, som velsignes af den
      ypperligere.
  8.  Og her er det dødelige Mennesker, som tager Tiende; men der er
      det en, om hvem der vidnes, at han lever.
  9.  Ja, så at sige, har endog Levi, som tager Tiende, igennem
      Abraham givet Tiende;
 10.  thi han var endnu i Faderens Lænd, da Melkisedek gik denne i
      Møde.

 11.  Hvis der altså var Fuldkommelse at få ved det levitiske
      Præstedømme (thi på Grundlag af dette har jo Folket fået Loven),
      hvilken Trang var der da yderligere til, at en anden Slags Præst
      skulde opstå efter Melkisedeks Vis og ikke nævnes efter Arons
      Vis?
 12.  Når nemlig Præstedømmet omskiftes, sker der med Nødvendighed
      også en Omskiftelse af Loven.
 13.  Thi han, om hvem dette siges, har hørt til en anden Stamme, af
      hvilken ingen har taget Vare på Alteret.
 14.  thi det er vitterligt, at af Juda er vor Herre oprunden, og for
      den Stammes Vedkommende har Moses intet talt om Præster.
 15.  Og det bliver end ydermere klart, når der i Lighed med
      Melkisedek opstår en anden Slags Præst,
 16.  som ikke er bleven det efter et kødeligt Buds Lov, men efter et
      uopløseligt Livs Kraft.
 17.  Thi han får det Vidnesbyrd: "Du er Præst til evig Tid efter
      Melkisedeks Vis."
 18.  Thi vel sker der Ophævelse af et forudgående Bud, fordi det var
      svagt og unyttigt
 19.  (thi Loven har ikke fuldkommet noget); men der sker Indførelse
      af et bedre Håb, ved hvilket vi nærme os til Gud.
 20.  Og så vist som det ikke er sket uden Ed,
 21.  (thi hine ere blevne Præster uden Ed, men denne med Ed, ved den,
      som siger til ham: "Herren svor, og han skal ikke angre det: Du
      er Præst til evig Tid"):
 22.  så vist er Jesus bleven Borgen for en bedre Pagt.
 23.  Og hine ere blevne Præster, flere efter hinanden, fordi de ved
      Døden hindredes i at vedblive;
 24.  men denne har et uforgængeligt Præstedømme, fordi han bliver til
      evig Tid,
 25.  hvorfor han også kan fuldkomment frelse dem, som komme til Gud
      ved ham, efterdi han lever altid til at gå i Forbøn for dem.

 26.  Thi en sådan Ypperstepræst var det også, som sømmede sig for os,
      en from, uskyldig, ubesmittet, adskilt fra Syndere og ophøjet
      over Himlene;
 27.  en, som ikke hver Dag har nødig, som Ypperstepræsterne, at
      frembære Ofre først for sine egne Synder, derefter for Folkets;
      thi dette gjorde han een Gang for alle, da han ofrede sig selv.
 28.  Thi Loven indsætter til Ypperstepræster Mennesker, som have
      Skrøbelighed; men Edens Ord, som kom senere end Loven, indsætter
      en Søn, som er fuldkommet til evig Tid:

Hebræerne 8

  1.  Men Hovedpunktet ved det, hvorom her tales, er dette: vi have en
      sådan Ypperstepræst, der har taget Sæde på højre Side af
      Majestætens Trone i Himlene
  2.  som Tjener ved Helligdommen og det sande Tabernakel, hvilket
      Herren har oprejst, og ikke et Menneske.
  3.  Thi hver Ypperstepræst indsættes til at frembære Gaver og
      Slagtofre; derfor er det nødvendigt, at også denne må have noget
      at frembære.
  4.  Dersom han nu var på Jorden, da var han ikke engang Præst,
      efterdi der her er dem, som frembære Gaverne efter Loven;
  5.  hvilke jo tjene ved en Afbildning og Skygge af det himmelske,
      således som det blev Moses betydet af Gud, da han skulde
      indrette Tabernaklet: "Se til, sagde han, at du gør alting efter
      det Forbillede, der blev vist dig på Bjerget."

  6.  Men nu har han fået en så meget ypperligere Tjeneste, som han
      også er Mellemmand for en bedre Pagt, der jo er grundet på bedre
      Forjættelser.
  7.  Thi dersom hin første var udadlelig, da vilde der ikke blive
      søgt Sted for en anden.
  8.  Thi dadlende siger han til dem: "Se, der kommer Dage, siger
      Herren, da jeg vil slutte en ny Pagt med Israels Hus og med
      Judas Hus;
  9.  ikke som den Pagt, jeg gjorde med deres Fædre på den Dag, da jeg
      tog dem ved Hånden for at føre dem ud af Ægyptens Land; thi de
      bleve ikke i min Pagt, og jeg brød mig ikke om dem, siger
      Herren.
 10.  Thi dette er den Pagt, som jeg vil oprette med Israels Hus efter
      de Dage, siger Herren: Jeg vil give mine Love i deres Sind, og
      jeg vil indskrive dem i deres Hjerte, og jeg vil være deres Gud,
      og de skulle være mit Folk.
 11.  Og de skulle ikke lære hver sin Medborger og hver sin Broder og
      sige: Kend Herren; thi de skulle alle kende mig, fra den mindste
      indtil den største iblandt dem.
 12.  Thi jeg vil være nådig imod deres Uretfærdigheder og ikke mere
      ihukomme deres Synder."
 13.  Når han siger: "en ny", har han erklæret den første for gammel;
      men det, som bliver gammelt og ældes, er nu ved at forsvinde.

Hebræerne 9

  1.  Vel havde også den første Pagt Forskrifter for Gudstjenesten og
      en jordisk Helligdom.
  2.  Thi der var indrettet et Telt, det forreste, hvori Lysestagen
      var og Bordet og Skuebrødene, det, som jo kaldes det Hellige.
  3.  Men bag det andet Forhæng var et Telt, det, som kaldes det
      Allerhelligste,
  4.  som havde et gyldent Røgelsealter og Pagtens Ark, overalt
      beklædt med Guld, i hvilken der var en Guldkrukke med Mannaen,
      og Arons Stav, som havde blomstret, og Pagtens Tavler,
  5.  men oven over den var Herlighedens Keruber, som overskyggede
      Nådestolen, hvorom der nu ikke skal tales enkeltvis.
  6.  Idet nu dette er således indrettet, gå Præsterne til Stadighed
      ind i det forreste Telt, når de forrette Tjenesten;
  7.  men i det andet går alene Ypperstepræsten ind een Gang om Året,
      ikke uden Blod,hvilket han ofrer for sig selv og Folkets
      Forseelser,
  8.  hvorved den Helligånd giver til Kende, at Vejen til Helligdommen
      endnu ikke er bleven åbenbar, så længe det førreste Telt endnu
      står,
  9.  hvilket jo er et Sindbillede indtil den nærværende Tid, og
      stemmende hermed frembæres der både Gaver og Ofre, som ikke i
      Henseende til Samvittigheden kunne fuldkomme den, der forretter
      sin Gudsdyrkelse,
 10.  men som kun, ved Siden af Mad og Drikke og forskellige
      Tvættelser, ere kødelige Forskrifter, pålagte indtil den rette
      Ordnings Tid.

 11.  Men da Kristus kom som Ypperstepræst for de kommende Goder, gik
      han igennem det større og fuldkomnere Telt, som ikke er gjort
      med Hænder, det er: som ikke er af denne Skabning,
 12.  og gik ikke heller med Blod af Bukke eller Kalve, men med sit
      eget Blod een Gang for alle ind i Helligdommen og vandt en evig
      Forløsning.
 13.  Thi dersom Blodet af Bukke og Tyre og Aske af en Kvie ved at
      stænkes på de besmittede helliger til Kødets Renhed:
 14.  hvor meget mere skal da Kristi Blod, hans, som ved en evig Ånd
      frembar sig selv lydeløs for Gud, rense eders Samvittighed fra
      døde Gerninger til at tjene den levende Gud?

 15.  Og derfor er han Mellemmand for en ny Pagt, for at de kaldede,
      da der har fundet Død Sted til Genløsning fra Overtrædelserne
      under den første Pagt, må få den evige Arvs Forjættelse.
 16.  Thi hvor der er en Arvepagt, der er det nødvendigt, at hans Død,
      som har oprettet Pagten, skal godtgøres.
 17.  Thi en Arvepagt er urokkelig efter døde, da den ingen Sinde
      træder i Kraft, medens den, som har oprettet den, lever.
 18.  Derfor er heller ikke den første bleven indviet uden Blod
 19.  Thi da hvert Bud efter Loven var forkyndt af Moses for hele
      Folket, tog han Kalve- og Bukkeblod med Vand og skarlagenrød Uld
      og Isop og bestænkede både Bogen selv og hele Folket, idet han
      sagde:
 20.  "Dette er den Pagts Blod, hvilken Gud har pålagt eder."
 21.  Og Tabernaklet og alle Tjenestens Redskaber bestænkede han
      ligeledes med Blodet.
 22.  Og næsten alt bliver efter Loven renset med Blod, og uden Blods
      Udgydelse sker der ikke Forladelse.

 23.  Altså var det en Nødvendighed, at Afbildningerne af de himmelske
      Ting skulde renses herved, men selve de himmelske Ting ved bedre
      Ofre end disse.
 24.  Thi Kristus gik ikke ind i en Helligdom, som var gjort med
      Hænder og kun var et Billede af den sande, men ind i selve
      Himmelen for nu at træde frem for Guds Ansigt til Bedste for os;
 25.  ikke heller for at han skulde ofre sig selv mange Gange, ligesom
      Ypperstepræsten hvert År går ind i Helligdommen med fremmed
      Blod;
 26.  ellers havde han måttet lide mange Gange fra Verdens
      Grundlæggelse; men nu er han een Gang for alle ved Tidernes
      Fuldendelse åbenbaret for at bortskaffe Synden ved sit Offer.
 27.  Og ligesom det er Menneskene beskikket at dø een Gang og
      derefter Dom,
 28.  således skal også Kristus, efter at være bleven een Gang ofret
      for at bære manges Synder, anden Gang, uden Synd, vise sig for
      dem, som foruente ham til Frelse.

Hebræerne 10

  1.  Thi da Loven kun har en Skygge af de kommende Goder og ikke
      Tingenes Skikkelse selv, kan den aldrig ved de samme årlige
      Ofre, som de bestandig frembære, fuldkomme dem, som træde frem
      dermed.
  2.  Vilde man ikke ellers have ophørt at frembære dem, fordi de
      ofrende ikke mere havde nogen Bevidsthed om Synder, når de een
      Gang vare rensede?
  3.  Men ved Ofrene sker År for År Ihukommelse af Synder.
  4.  Thi det er umuligt, at Blod af Tyre og Bukke kan borttage
      Synder.

  5.  Derfor siger han, idet han indtræder i Verden: "Slagtoffer og
      Madoffer havde du ikke Lyst til; men et Legeme beredte du mig;
  6.  Brændofre og Syndofre havde du ikke Behag i.
  7.  Da sagde jeg: Se, jeg er kommen (i Bogrullen er der skrevet om
      mig) for at gøre, Gud! din Villie."
  8.  Medens han først siger: "Slagtofre og Madofre og Brændofre og
      Syndofre havde du ikke Lyst til og ej heller Behag i" (og disse
      frembæres dog efter Loven),
  9.  så har han derefter sagt: "Se, jeg er kommen for at gøre din
      Villie." Han ophæver det første for at fastsætte det andet.
 10.  Og ved denne Villie ere vi helligede ved Ofringen af Jesu Kristi
      Legeme een Gang for alle.
 11.  Og hver Præst står daglig og tjener og ofrer mange Gange de
      samme Ofre, som dog aldrig kunne borttage Synder.
 12.  Men denne har efter at have ofret eet Offer for Synderne sat sig
      for bestandig ved Guds højre Hånd,
 13.  idet han for øvrigt venter på, at hans Fjender skulle lægges som
      en Skammel for hans Fødder.
 14.  Thi med et eneste Offer har han for bestandig fuldkommet dem,
      som helliges.
 15.  Men også den Helligånd giver os Vidnesbyrd; thi efter at have
      sagt:
 16.  "Dette er den Pagt, som jeg vil oprette med dem efter de Dage,"
      siger Herren: "Jeg vil give mine Love i deres Hjerter, og jeg
      vil indskrive dem i deres Sind,
 17.  og deres Synder og deres Overtrædelser vil jeg ikke mere
      ihukomme."
 18.  Men hvor der er Forladelse for disse, er der ikke mere Offer for
      Synd.

 19.  Efterdi vi da, Brødre! have Frimodighed til den Indgang i
      Helligdommen ved Jesu Blod,
 20.  som han indviede os som en ny og levende Vej igennem Forhænget,
      det er hans Kød,
 21.  og efterdi vi have en stor Præst over Guds Hus:
 22.  så lader os træde frem med et sandt Hjerte, i Troens fulde
      Forvisning, med Hjerterne ved Bestænkelsen rensede fra en ond
      Samvittighed, og Legemet tvættet med rent Vand;
 23.  lader os fastholde Håbets Bekendelse urokket; thi trofast er
      han, som gav Forjættelsen;
 24.  og lader os give Agt på hverandre, så vi opflamme hverandre til
      Kærlighed og gode Gerninger
 25.  og ikke forlade vor egen Forsamling, som nogle have for Skik,
      men formane hverandre, og det så meget mere, som I se, at Dagen
      nærmer sig.

 26.  Thi Synde vi med Villie, efter at have modtaget Sandhedens
      Erkendelse, er der intet Offer mere tilbage for Synder,
 27.  men en frygtelig Forventelse at Dom og en brændende Nidkærhed,
      som skal fortære de genstridige.
 28.  Når en har brudt med Mose Lov, dør han uden Barmhjertighed på to
      eller tre Vidners Udsagn;
 29.  hvor meget værre Straf mene I da, at den skal agtes værd, som
      træder Guds Søn under Fod og agter Pagtens Blod, hvormed han
      blev helliget, for urent og forhåner Nådens Ånd?
 30.  Thi vi kende den, som har sagt: "Mig hører Hævnen til, jeg vil
      betale, siger Herren;" og fremdeles: "Herren skal dømme sit
      Folk."
 31.  Det er frygteligt at falde i den levende Guds Hænder.

 32.  Men kommer de forrige Dage i Hu, i hvilke I, efter at I vare
      blevne oplyste, udholdt megen Kamp i Lidelser,
 33.  idet I dels selv ved Forhånelser og Trængsler bleve et Skuespil,
      dels gjorde fælles Sag med dem, som fristede sådanne Kår.
 34.  Thi både havde I Medlidenhed med de fangne, og I fandt eder med
      Glæde i, at man røvede, hvad I ejede, vidende, at I selv have en
      bedre og blivende Ejendom.
 35.  Kaster altså ikke eders Frimodighed bort, hvilken jo har stor
      Belønning;
 36.  thi I have Udholdenhed nødig, for at I, når I have gjort Guds
      Villie, kunne opnå Forjættelsen.
 37.  Thi "der er endnu kun en såre liden Stund, så kommer han, der
      skal komme, og han vil ikke tøve.
 38.  Men min retfærdige skal leve af Tro; og dersom han unddrager
      sig, har min Sjæl ikke Behag i ham."
 39.  Men vi ere ikke af dem, som unddrage sig, til Fortabelse, men af
      dem, som tro, til Sjælens Frelse,

Hebræerne 11

  1.  Men Tro er en Fortrøstning til det, som håbes, en Overbevisning
      om Ting, som ikke ses.
  2.  Ved den fik jo de gamle godt Vidnesbyrd.
  3.  Ved Tro fatte vi, at Verden er bleven skabt ved Guds Ord, så det
      ikke er af synlige Ting, at det, som ses, er blevet til.
  4.  Ved Tro ofrede Abel Gud et bedre Offer end Kain, og ved den fik
      han det Vidnesbyrd, at han var retfærdig, idet Gud bevidnede sit
      Velbehag i hans Gaver; og ved den taler han endnu efter sin Død.
  5.  Ved Tro blev Enok borttagen, for at han ikke skulde se Døden, og
      han blev ikke funden, efterdi Gud havde taget ham bort; thi før
      Borttagelsen har han fået det Vidnesbyrd, at han har behaget
      Gud.
  6.  Men uden Tro er det umuligt at behage ham; thi den, som kommer
      frem for Gud, bør tro, at han er til, og at han bliver deres
      Belønner, som søge ham.
  7.  Ved Tro var det, at Noa, advaret af Gud om det, som endnu ikke
      sås, i Gudsfrygt indrettede en Ark til Frelse for sit Hus; ved
      den domfældte han Verden og blev Arving til Retfærdigheden
      ifølge Tro.
  8.  Ved Tro adlød Abraham, da han blev kaldet, så han gik ud til et
      Sted, som han skulde tage til Arv; og han gik ud, skønt han ikke
      vidste, hvor han kom hen.
  9.  Ved Tro blev han Udlænding i Forjættelsens Land som i et fremmed
      og boede i Telte med Isak og Jakob, som vare Medarvinger til
      samme Forjættelse;
 10.  thi han forventede den Stad, som har fast Grundvold, hvis
      Bygmester og Grundlægger er Gud.
 11.  Ved Tro fik endog Sara selv Kraft til at undfange endog ud over
      sin Alders Tid; thi hun holdt ham for trofast, som havde
      forjættet det.
 12.  Derfor avledes der også af en, og det en udlevet, som Himmelens
      Stjerner i Mangfoldighed og som Sandet ved Havets Bred, det, som
      ikke kan tælles.
 13.  I Tro døde alle disse uden at have opnået Forjættelserne; men de
      så dem langt borte og hilsede dem og bekendte, at de vare
      fremmede og Udlændinge på Jorden.
 14.  De, som sige sådant, give jo klarlig til Kende, at de søge et
      Fædreland.
 15.  Og dersom de havde haft det, hvorfra de vare udgåede, i Tanker,
      havde de vel haft Tid til at vende tilbage;
 16.  men nu hige de efter et bedre, det er et himmelsk; derfor
      skammer Gud sig ikke ved dem, ved at kaldes deres Gud; thi han
      har betedt dem en, Stad.
 17.  Ved Tro har Abraham ofret Isak, da han blev prøvet, ja, den.
      enbårne ofrede han, som havde modtaget Forjættelserne,
 18.  til hvem der var sagt: "I Isak skal en Sæd få Navn efter dig; "
 19.  thi han betænkte, at Gud var mægtig endog til at oprejse fra de
      døde, hvorfra han jo også lignelsesvis fik ham tilbage.
 20.  Ved Tro udtalte Isak Velsignelse over Jakob og Esau angående
      kommende Ting.
 21.  Ved Tro velsignede Jakob døende hver af Josefs Sønner og tilbad,
      lænende sig over sin Stav.
 22.  Ved Tro talte Josef på sit yderste om Israels Børns Udgang og
      gav Befaling om sine Ben.
 23.  Ved Tro blev Moses, da han var født, skjult i tre Måneder af
      sine Forældre, fordi de så, at Barnet var dejligt, og de
      frygtede ikke for Kongens Befaling.
 24.  Ved Tro nægtede Moses, da han var bleven stor, at kaldes Søn af
      Faraos Datter
 25.  og valgte hellere at lide ondt med Guds Folk end at have en
      kortvarig Nydelse af Synd,
 26.  idet han agtede Kristi Forsmædelse for større Rigdom end
      Ægyptens Skatte; thi han så hen til Belønningen.
 27.  Ved Tro forlod han Ægypten uden at frygte for Kongens Vrede; thi
      som om han så den usynlige, holdt han ud.
 28.  Ved Tro har han indstiftet Påsken og Påstrygelsen af Blodet, for
      at den, som ødelagde de førstefødte, ikke skulde røre dem.
 29.  Ved Tro gik de igennem det røde Hav som over tørt Land, medens
      Ægypterne druknede under Forsøget derpå.
 30.  Ved Tro faldt Jerikos Mure, efter at de vare omgåede i syv Dage.
 31.  Ved Tro undgik Skøgen Rahab at omkomme med de genstridige; thi
      hun modtog Spejderne med Fred.
 32.  Dog, hvorfor skal jeg tale mere? Tiden vil jo fattes mig, hvis
      jeg skal fortælle om Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jefta, David og
      Samuel og Profeterne,
 33.  som ved Tro overvandt Riger, øvede Retfærdighed, opnåede
      Forjættelser, stoppede Løvers Mund,
 34.  slukkede Ilds Kraft, undslap Sværds Od, bleve stærke efter
      Svaghed, bleve vældige i Krig, bragte fremmedes Hære til at
      vige.
 35.  Kvinder fik deres døde igen ved Opstandelse. Andre bleve lagte
      på Pinebænk og toge ikke imod Befrielse, for at de måtte opnå en
      bedre Opstandelse.
 36.  Andre måtte friste Forhånelser og Hudstrygelser, tilmed Lænker
      og Fængsel;
 37.  de bleve stenede, gennemsavede, fristede, dræbte med Sværd, gik
      omkring i Fåre- og Gedeskind, lidende Mangel, betrængte,
      mishandlede
 38.  (dem var Verden ikke værd), omvankende i Ørkener og på Bjerge og
      i Huler og Jordens Kløfter.
 39.  Og alle disse, skønt de havde Vidnesbyrd for deres Tro, opnåede
      ikke Forjættelsen,
 40.  efterdi Gud forud havde udset noget bedre for os, for at de ikke
      skulde fuldkommes uden os.

Hebræerne 12

  1.  Derfor lader også os, efterdi vi have så stor en Sky af Vidner
      omkring os, aflægge enhver Byrde og Synden, som lettelig hilder
      os, og med Udholdenhed gennemløbe den foran os liggende Bane,
  2.  idet vi se hen til Troens Begynder og Fuldender, Jesus, som for
      den foran ham liggende Glædes Skyld udholdt et Kors, idet han
      ringeagtede Skændselen, og som har taget Sæde på højre Side af
      Guds Trone.
  3.  Ja, tænker på ham, som har udholdt en sådan Modsigelse imod sig
      af Syndere, for at I ikke skulle blive trætte og forsagte i
      eders Sjæle,

  4.  Endnu have I ikke stået imod indtil Blodet i eders Kamp imod
      Synden,
  5.  og I have glemt Formaningen, der jo dog taler til eder som til
      Sønner: "Min Søn! agt ikke Herrens Tugtelse ringe, vær heller
      ikke forsagt, når du revses af ham;
  6.  thi hvem Herren elsker, den tugter han, og han slår hårdelig
      hver Søn, som han tager sig af."
  7.  Holder ud og lader eder tugte; Gud handler med eder som med
      Sønner; thi hvem er den Søn, som Faderen ikke tugter?
  8.  Men dersom I ere uden Tugtelse, hvori alle have fået Del, da ere
      I jo uægte og ikke Sønner.
  9.  Fremdeles, vore kødelige Fædre havde vi til Optugtere, og vi
      følte Ærefrygt; skulde vi da ikke meget mere underordne os under
      Åndernes Fader og leve?
 10.  thi hine tugtede os for nogle få Dage efter deres Tykke, men han
      gør det til vort Gavn, for at vi skulle få Del i hans Hellighed.
 11.  Al Tugtelse synes vel, imedens den er nærværende, ikke at være
      til Glæde, men til Bedrøvelse; men siden giver den til Gengæld
      dem, som derved ere øvede, en Fredens Frugt i Retfærdighed.

 12.  Derfor, retter de slappede Hænder og de lammede Knæ,
 13.  og træder lige Spor med eders Fødder, for at ikke det lamme skal
      vrides af Led, men snarere helbredes.
 14.  Stræber efter Fred med alle og efter Helliggørelsen, uden
      hvilken ingen skal se Herren;
 15.  og ser til, at ikke nogen går Glip af Guds Nåde, at ikke nogen
      bitter Rod skyder op og gør Skade, og de mange smittes ved den;
 16.  at ikke nogen er en utugtig eller en vanhellig som Esau, der for
      een Ret Mad solgte sin Førstefødselsret.
 17.  Thi I vide, at han også siden, da han ønskede at arve
      Velsignelsen, blev forkastet (thi han fandt ikke Rum for
      Omvendelse), omendskønt han begærede den med Tårer.

 18.  I ere jo ikke komne til en håndgribelig og brændende Ild og til
      Mulm og Mørke og Uvejr,
 19.  og ikke til Basunens Klang og til en talende Røst, hvorom de,
      der hørte den, bade, at der ikke mere måtte tales til dem.
 20.  Thi de kunde ikke bære det, som blev påbudt: "Endog om et Dyr
      rører ved Bjerget, skal det stenes".
 21.  Og - så frygteligt var Synet - Moses sagde: "Jeg er forfærdet og
      bæver."
 22.  Men I ere komne til Zions Bjerg og til den levende Guds Stad,
      til det himmelske Jerusalem og til Englenes Titusinder i
      Højtidsskare
 23.  og til de førstefødtes Menighed, som ere indskrevne i Himlene,
      og til en Dommer, som er alles Gud, og til de fuldkommede
      retfærdiges Ånder
 24.  og til den nye Pagts Mellemmand, Jesus, og til Bestænkelsens
      Blod, som taler bedre end Abel.
 25.  Ser til, at I ikke bede eder fri for den, som taler. Thi når de,
      som bade sig fri for ham, der talte sit Guddomsord på Jorden,
      ikke undslap, da skulle vi det meget mindre, når vi vende os
      bort fra ham, der taler fra Himlene,
 26.  han, hvis Røst dengang rystede Jorden, men som nu har forjættet
      og sagt: "Endnu een Gang vil jeg ryste, ikke alene Jorden, men
      også Himmelen."
 27.  Men dette "endnu een Gang" giver til Kende, at de Ting, der
      rystes, skulle omskiftes, efterdi de ere skabte, for at de Ting,
      der ikke rystes, skulle blive.
 28.  Derfor, efterdi vi modtage et Rige, som ikke kan rystes, så
      lader os være taknemmelige og derved tjene Gud til hans
      Velbehag, med Ængstelse og Frygt.
 29.  Thi vor Gud er en fortærende Ild.

Hebræerne 13

  1.  Broderkærligheden blive ved!
  2.  Glemmer ikke Gæstfriheden; thi ved den have nogle, uden at vide
      det, haft Engle til Gæster.
  3.  Kommer de fangne i Hu, som vare I selv medfangne; dem, der lide
      ilde, som de, der også selv ere i et Legeme.
  4.  Ægteskabet være æret hos alle, og Ægtesengen ubesmittet; thi
      utugtige og Horkarle skal Gud dømme.
  5.  Eders Vandel være uden Pengegridskhed, nøjes med det, I have;
      thi han har selv sagt: "Jeg vil ingenlunde slippe dig og
      ingenlunde forlade dig,"
  6.  så at vi kunne sige med frit Mod: "Herren er min Hjælper, jeg
      vil ikke frygte; hvad kan et Menneske gøre mig?"

  7.  Kommer eders Vejledere i Hu, som have forkyndt eder Guds Ord, og
      idet I betragte deres Vandrings Udgang, så efterligner deres
      Tro!
  8.  Jesus Kristus er i Går og i Dag den samme, ja, til evig Tid.
  9.  Lader eder ikke lede vild af mange Hånde og fremmede Lærdomme;
      thi det er godt, at Hjertet styrkes ved Nåden, ikke ved Spiser;
      thi deraf have de, som holdt sig dertil, ingen Nytte haft.
 10.  Vi have et Alter, hvorfra de, som tjene ved Tabernaklet, ikke
      have Ret til at spise.
 11.  Thi de Dyr, hvis Blod for Syndens Skyld bæres ind i Helligdommen
      af Ypperstepræsten, deres Kroppe opbrændes uden for Lejren.
 12.  Derfor led også Jesus uden for Porten, for at han kunde hellige
      Folket ved sit eget Blod.
 13.  Så lader os da gå ud til ham uden for Lejren, idet vi bære hans
      Forsmædelse;
 14.  thi her have vi ikke en blivende Stad, men vi søge den kommende.
 15.  Lader os da ved ham altid frembære Gud Lovprisnings Offer, det
      er: en Frugt af Læber, som bekende hans Navn.
 16.  Men glemmer ikke at gøre vel og at meddele; thi i sådanne Ofre
      har Gud Velbehag.

 17.  Lyder eders Vejledere og retter eder efter dem; thi de våge
      over, eders Sjæle som de, der skulle gøre Regnskab - for at de
      må gøre dette med Glæde og ikke sukkende: thi dette er eder ikke
      gavnligt.
 18.  Beder for os; thi vi ere forvissede om, at vi have en god
      Samvittighed, idet vi ønske at vandre rettelig i alle Ting.
 19.  Og jeg formaner eder des mere til at gøre dette, for at jeg
      desto snarere kan gives eder igen.

 20.  Men Fredens Gud, som førte den store Fårenes Hyrde, vor Herre
      Jesus, op fra de døde med en evig Pagts Blod,
 21.  han bringe eder til Fuldkommenhed i alt godt, til at gøre hans
      Villie, og han virke i eder det, som er velbehageligt for hans
      Åsyn, ved Jesus Kristus: ham være Æren i Evighedernes Evigheder:
      Amen.
 22.  Jeg beder eder, Brødre! at I finde eder i dette Formaningsord;
      thi jeg har jo skrevet til eder i Korthed.
 23.  Vid, at vor Broder Timotheus er løsladt; sammen med ham vil jeg
      se eder, dersom han snart kommer.
 24.  Hilser alle eders Vejledere og alle de hellige! De fra Italien
      hilse eder.
 25.  Nåden være med eder alle!


Jakob

Jakob 1

  1.  Jakob, Guds og den Herres Jesu Kristi Tjener, hilser de tolv
      Stammer i Adspredelsen.

  2.  Mine Brødre! agter det for idel Glæde, når I stedes i mange
      Hånde Prøvelser,
  3.  vidende, at eders Tros Prøve virker Udholdenhed;
  4.  men Udholdenheden bør medføre fuldkommen Gerning, for at I kunne
      være fuldkomne og uden Brøst, så I ikke stå tilbage i noget.
  5.  Men dersom nogen af eder fattes Visdom, han bede derom til Gud,
      som giver alle gerne og uden Bebrejdelse, så skal den gives ham.
  6.  Men han bede i Tro, uden at tvivle; thi den, som tvivler, ligner
      en Havets Bølge, der drives og kastes af Vinden.
  7.  Ikke må nemlig det Menneske mene, at han skal få noget af Herren,
  8.  en tvesindet Mand, som han er, ustadig på alle sine Veje.

  9.  Men den Broder, som er ringe, rose sig af sin Højhed,
 10.  den rige derimod af sin Ringhed; thi han skal forgå som Græssets
      Blomst.
 11.  Thi Solen står op med sin Hede og hentørrer Græsset, og dets
      Blomst falder af, og dens Skikkelses Ynde forsvinder; således
      skal også den rige visne på sine Veje.

 12.  Salig den Mand, som holder Prøvelse ud; thi når han har stået
      Prøve, skal han få Livets Krans, som Herren har forjættet dem,
      der elske ham.
 13.  Ingen sige, når han fristes: "Jeg fristes af Gud;" thi Gud kan
      ikke fristes af det onde, og selv frister han ingen;
 14.  men enhver fristes,når han drages og lokkes af sin egen
      Begæring;
 15.  derefter, når Begæringen har undfanget, føder den Synd, men når
      Synden er fuldvoksen, føder den Død.
 16.  Farer ikke vild, mine elskede Brødre!
 17.  Al god Gave og al fuldkommen Gave er ovenfra og kommer ned fra
      Lysenes Fader, hos hvem der ikke er Forandring eller skiftende
      Skygge.
 18.  Efter sin Villie fødte han os ved Sandheds Ord, for at vi skulde
      være en Førstegrøde af hans Skabninger.

 19.  I vide det, mine elskede Brødre. Men hvert Menneske være snar
      til at høre, langsom til at tale, langsom til Vrede;
 20.  thi en Mands Vrede udretter ikke det, som er ret for Gud.
 21.  Derfor, aflægger alt Smuds og Levning af Slethed, og modtager
      med Sagtmodighed Ordet, som er indplantet i eder, og som formår
      at frelse eders Sjæle.
 22.  Men vorder Ordets Gørere og ikke alene dets Hørere, hvormed I
      bedrage eder selv.
 23.  Thi dersom nogen er Ordets Hører og ikke dets Gører, han ligner
      en Mand, der betragter sit legemlige Ansigt i et Spejl;
 24.  thi han betragter sig selv og går bort og glemmer straks, hvor
      dan han var.
 25.  Men den, som skuer ind i Frihedens fuldkomne Lov og holder ved
      dermed, så han ikke bliver en glemsom Tilhører, men en
      Gerningens Gører, han skal være salig i sin Gerning.

 26.  Dersom nogen synes, at han dyrker Gud, og ikke holder sin Tunge
      i Tømme, men bedrager sit Hjerte, hans Gudsdyrkelse er forgæves.
 27.  En ren og ubesmittet Gudsdyrkelse for Gud og Faderen er dette,
      at besøge faderløse og Enker i deres Trængsel, at holde sig selv
      uplettet af Verden.

Jakob 2

  1.  Mine Brødre! Eders Tro på vor Herre Jesus Kristus, den
      herliggjorte, være ikke forbunden med Persons Anseelse!
  2.  Når der nemlig kommer en Mand ind i eders Forsamling med
      Guldring på Fingeren, i prægtig Klædning, men der også kommer en
      fattig ind i smudsig Klædning,
  3.  og I fæste Øjet på den, som bærer den prægtige Klædning og sige:
      Sæt du dig her på den gode Plads, og I sige til den fattige: Stå
      du der eller sæt dig nede ved min Fodskammel:
  4.  ere I så ikke komne i Strid med eder selv og blevne Dommere med
      slette Tanker?
  5.  Hører, mine elskede Brødre! Har Gud ikke udvalgt de for Verden
      fattige til at være rige i Tro og Arvinger til det Rige, som han
      har forjættet dem, der elske ham?
  6.  Men I have vanæret den fattige! Er det ikke de rige, som
      underkue eder, og er det ikke dem, som slæbe eder for
      Domstolene?
  7.  Er det ikke dem, som bespotte det skønne Navn, som er nævnet
      over eder?

  8.  Ganske vist, dersom I opfylde den kongelige Lov efter Skriften:
      "Du skal elske din Næste som dig selv", gøre I ret;
  9.  men dersom I anse Personer, gøre I Synd og revses af Loven som
      Overtrædere.
 10.  Thi den, som holder hele Loven, men støder an i eet Stykke, er
      bleven skyldig i alle.
 11.  Thi han, som sagde: "Du må ikke bedrive Hor," sagde også: "Du må
      ikke slå ihjel." Dersom du da ikke bedriver Hor, men slår ihjel,
      da er du bleven en Lovens Overtræder.
 12.  Taler således og gører således, som de, der skulle dømmes efter
      Frihedens Lov.
 13.  Thi Dommen er ubarmhjertig imod den, som ikke har øvet
      Barmhjertighed; Barmhjertighed træder frimodigt op imod Dommen.

 14.  Hvad gavner det, mine Brødre! om nogen siger, han har Tro, men
      ikke har Gerninger? mon Troen kan frelse ham?
 15.  Dersom en Broder eller Søster er nøgen og fattes den daglige
      Føde,
 16.  og en af eder siger til dem: Går bort i Fred, varmer eder og
      mætter eder, men I ikke give dem det, som hører til Legemets
      Nødtørst, hvad gavner det?
 17.  Ligeså er også Troen, dersom den ikke har Gerninger, død i sig
      selv.
 18.  Men man vil sige: Du har Tro, og jeg har Gerninger. Vis mig din
      Tro uden Gerningerne, og jeg vil af mine Gerninger vise dig
      Troen.
 19.  Du tror, at Gud er een; deri gør du ret; også de onde Ånder tro
      det og skælve.
 20.  Men vil du vide, du tomme Menneske! at Troen uden Gerninger er
      unyttig?
 21.  Blev ikke vor Fader Abraham retfærdiggjort af Gerninger, da han
      ofrede sin Søn Isak på Alteret?
 22.  Du ser, at Troen virkede sammen med hans Gerninger, og ved
      Gerningerne blev Troen fuldkommet,
 23.  og Skriften blev opfyldt, som siger: "Abraham troede Gud, og det
      blev regnet ham til Retfærdighed", og han blev kaldet Guds Ven.
 24.  I se, at et Menneske retfærdiggøres af Gerninger, og ikke af Tro
      alene.
 25.  Ligeså Skøgen Rahab, blev ikke også hun retfærdiggjort af
      Gerninger, da hun tog imod Sendebudene og lod dem slippe bort ad
      en anden Vej?
 26.  Thi ligesom Legemet er dødt uden Ånd, således er også Troen død
      uden Gerninger.

Jakob 3

  1.  Mine Brødre! ikke mange af eder bør blive Lærere, såsom I vide,
      at vi skulle få en desto tungere Dom.
  2.  Thi vi støde alle an i mange Ting; dersom nogen ikke støder an i
      Tale, da er han en fuldkommen Mand, i Stand til også at holde
      hele Legemet i Tomme.
  3.  Men når vi lægge Bidsler i Hestenes Munde, for at de skulle
      adlyde os, så dreje vi også hele deres Legeme.
  4.  Se, også Skibene, endskønt de ere så store og drives af stærke
      Vinde, drejes med et såre lidet Ror, hvorhen Styrmandens Hu
      står.
  5.  Således er også Tungen et lille Lem og fører store Ord. Se, hvor
      lille en Ild der stikker så stor en Skov i Brand!
  6.  Og Tungen er en Ild. Som en Verden af Uretfærdighed sidder
      Tungen iblandt vore Lemmer; den besmitter hele Legemet og sætter
      Livets Hjul i Brand, selv sat i Brand af Helvede.
  7.  Thi enhver Natur, både Dyrs og Fugles, både Krybdyrs og Havdyrs,
      tæmmes og er tæmmet af den menneskelige Natur;
  8.  men Tungen kan intet Menneske tæmme, det ustyrlige Onde, fuld af
      dødbringende Gift.
  9.  Med den velsigne vi Herren og Faderen, og med den forbande vi
      Menneskene, som ere blevne til efter Guds Lighed.
 10.  Af den samme Mund udgår Velsignelse og Forbandelse. Mine Brødre!
      dette bør ikke være så.
 11.  Mon en Kilde udgyder sødt Vand og besk Vand af det samme Væld?
 12.  Mon et Figentræ, mine Brødre! kan give Oliven, eller et Vintræ
      Figener? Heller ikke kan en Salt Kilde give fersk Vand.

 13.  Er nogen viis og forstandig iblandt eder, da vise han ved god
      Omgængelse sine Gerninger i viis Sagtmodighed!
 14.  Men have I bitter Avind og Rænkesyge i eders Hjerter, da roser
      eder ikke og lyver ikke imod Sandheden!
 15.  Dette er ikke den Visdom, som kommer ovenfra, men en jordisk,
      sjælelig, djævelsk;
 16.  thi hvor der er Avind og Rænkesyge, der er Forvirring og al ond
      Handel.
 17.  Men Visdommen herovenfra er først ren, dernæst fredsommelig,
      mild, føjelig, fuld at Barmhjertighed og gode Frugter, upartisk,
      uden Skrømt.
 18.  Men Retfærdigheds Frugt såes i Fred for dem, som stifte Fred.

Jakob 4

  1.  Hvoraf kommer det, at den er Krige og Stridigheder iblandt eder?
      mon ikke deraf, af eders Lyster, som stride i eders Lemmer?
  2.  I begære og have ikke; I myrde og misunde og kunne ikke få; I
      føre Strid og Krig. Og I have ikke, fordi I ikke bede;
  3.  I bede og få ikke, fordi I bede ilde, for at øde det i eders
      Lyster.
  4.  I utro! vide I ikke, at Venskab med Verden er Fjendskab imod
      Gud?  Derfor, den, som vil være Verdens Ven, bliver Guds Fjende.
  5.  Eller mene I, at Skriftens Ord ere tomme Ord? Med Nidkærhed
      længes han efter den Ånd, han har givet Bolig i os, men han
      skænker desto større Nåde.
  6.  Derfor siger Skriften: "Gud står de hoffærdige imod, men de
      ydmyge giver han Nåde."
  7.  Underordner eder derfor under Gud; men står Djævelen imod, så
      skal han fly fra eder;
  8.  holder eder nær til Gud, så skal han holde sig nær til eder!
      Renser Hænderne, I Syndere! og lutrer Hjerterne, I tvesindede!
  9.  Jamrer og sørger og græder; eders Latter vende sig til Sorg og
      Glæden til Bedrøvelse!
 10.  Ydmyger eder for Herren, så skal han ophøje eder.

 11.  Taler ikke ilde om hverandre, Brødre! Den, som taler ilde om sin
      Broder eller dømmer sin Broder, taler ilde om Loven og dømmer
      Loven; men dømmer du Loven, da er du ikke Lovens Gører, men dens
      Dommer.
 12.  Een er Lovgiveren og Dommeren, han, som kan frelse og fordærve;
      men hvem er du, som dømmer din Næste?

 13.  Og nu I, som sige: I Dag eller i Morgen ville vi gå til den
      eller den By og blive der et År og købslå og vinde,
 14.  I, som ikke vide, hvad der skal ske i Morgen; thi hvordan er
      eders Liv? I ere jo en Damp, som er til Syne en liden Tid, men
      derefter forsvinder;
 15.  i Stedet for at I skulle sige: Dersom Herren vil, og vi leve, da
      ville vi gøre dette eller hint.
 16.  Men nu rose I eder i eders Overmod; al sådan Ros er ond.
 17.  Derfor, den som ved at handle ret og ikke gør det, for ham er
      det Synd.

Jakob 5

  1.  Og nu, I rige! græder og jamrer over de Ulykker, som komme over
      eder.
  2.  Eders Rigdom er rådnet, og eders Klæder er mølædte;
  3.  eders Guld og Sølv er rustet op, og deres Rust skal være til
      Vidnesbyrd imod eder og æde eders Kød som en Ild; I have samlet
      Skatte i de sidste Dage.
  4.  Se, den Løn skriger, som I have forholdt Arbejderne, der høstede
      eders Marker, og Høstfolkenes Råb ere komne ind for den Herre
      Zebaoths Øren.
  5.  I levede i Vellevned på Jorden og efter eders Lyster; I gjorde
      eders Hjerter til gode som på en Slagtedag.
  6.  I domfældte, I dræbte den retfærdige; han står eder ikke imod.

  7.  Derfor, værer tålmodige, Brødre! indtil Herrens Tilkommelse. Se,
      Bonden venter på Jordens dyrebare Frugt og bier tålmodigt efter
      den, indtil den får tidlig Regn og sildig Regn.
  8.  Værer også I tålmodige, styrker eders Hjerter; thi Herrens
      Tilkommelse er nær.
  9.  Sukker ikke imod hverandre, Brødre! for at I ikke skulle dømmes;
      se, Dommeren står for Døren.
 10.  Brødre! tager Profeterne, som have talt i Herrens Navn, til
      Forbillede på at lide ondt og være tålmodige.
 11.  Se, vi prise dem salige, som have holdt ud. I have hørt om Jobs
      Udholdenhed og vide Udfaldet fra Herren; thi Herren er såre
      medlidende og barmhjertig.

 12.  Men for alting, mine Brødre! sværger ikke, hverken ved Himmelen
      eller ved Jorden eller nogen anden Ed; men eders Ja være Ja, og
      Nej være Nej, for at I ikke skulle falde under Dom.

 13.  Lider nogen iblandt eder ondt, han bede; er nogen vel til Mode,
      han synge Lovsang!
 14.  Er nogen iblandt eder syg, han kalde Menighedens Ældste til sig,
      og de skulle bede over ham og salve ham med Olie i Herrens Navn.
 15.  Og Troens Bøn skal frelse den syge, og Herren skal oprejse ham,
      og har han gjort Synder, skulle de forlades ham.
 16.  Bekender derfor Synderne for hverandre og beder for hverandre,
      for at I må blive helbredte; en retfærdigs Bøn formår meget, når
      den er alvorlig.
 17.  Elias var et Menneske, lige Vilkår undergivet med os, og han bad
      en Bøn, at det ikke måtte regne; og det regnede ikke på Jorden i
      tre År og seks Måneder.
 18.  Og han bad atter, og Himmelen gav Regn, og Jorden bar sin Frugt.

 19.  Mine Brødre! dersom nogen iblandt eder farer vild fra Sandheden,
      og nogen omvender ham,
 20.  han vide, at den, som omvender en Synder fra hans Vejs
      Vildfarelse, han Frelser en Sjæl fra Døden og skjuler en
      Mangfoldighed af Synder.


1.Peter

1.Peter 1

  1.  Peter, Jesu Kristi Apostel, til Udlændingene i Adspredelse i
      Pontus, Galatien, Kappadokien, Asien og Bithynien,
  2.  udvalgte efter Gud Faders Forudviden, ved Åndens Helligelse, til
      Lydighed og Bestænkelse med Jesu Kristi Blod: Nåde og Fred vorde
      eder mangfoldig til Del!

  3.  Lovet være Gud og vor Herres Jesu Kristi Fader, som efter sin
      store Barmhjertighed har genfødt os til et levende Håb ved Jesu
      Kristi Opstandelse fra de døde,
  4.  til en uforkrænkelig og ubesmittelig og uvisnelig Arv, som er
      bevaret i Himlene til eder,
  5.  I, som ved Guds Kraft bevogtes ved Tro til en Frelse, som er
      rede til at åbenbares i den sidste Tid,
  6.  i hvilken I skulle fryde eder, om I end nu en liden Stund, hvis
      så skal være, bedrøves i mange Hånde Prøvelser,
  7.  for at eders prøvede Tro, som er meget dyrebarere end det
      forgængelige Guld, der dog prøves ved Ild, må findes til Ros og
      Herlighed og Ære i Jesu Kristi Åbenbarelse,
  8.  ham, som I ikke have set og dog elske, ham, som I, skønt I nu
      ikke se, men tro, skulle fryde eder over med en uudsigelig og
      forherliget Glæde,
  9.  når I nå Målet for eders Tro, Sjælenes Frelse.
 10.  Om denne Frelse have Profeter gransket og ransaget, de, som
      profeterede om den Nåde, der skulde blive eder til Del,
 11.  idet de granskede over, hvilken eller hvordan en Tid Kristi Ånd,
      som var i dem, henviste til, når den forud vidnede om Kristi
      Lidelser og den derpå følgende Herlighed.
 12.  Og det blev dem åbenbaret, at det ikke var dem selv, men eder,
      de tjente med disse Ting, som nu ere blevne eder kundgjorte ved
      dem, der have forkyndt eder Evangeliet i den Helligånd, som blev
      sendt fra Himmelen, hvilke Ting Engle begære at skue ind i.

 13.  Derfor, binder op om eders Sinds Lænder, værer ædrue, og sætter
      fuldt ud eders Håb til den Nåde, som bliver eder til Del i Jesu
      Kristi Åbenbarelse.
 14.  Som lydige Børn skulle I ikke skikke eder efter de forrige
      Lyster i eders Vankundighed;
 15.  men efter den hellige, som kaldte eder, skulle også I vorde
      hellige i al eders Vandel;
 16.  thi der er skrevet: "I skulle være hellige, thi jeg er hellig."
 17.  Og dersom I påkalde ham som Fader, der dømmer uden Persons
      Anseelse efter enhvers Gerning, da bør I vandre i Frygt eders
      Udlændigheds Tid,
 18.  vel vidende, at det ikke var med forkrænkelige Ting,, Sølv eller
      Guld, at I bleve løskøbte fra eders tomme Vandel, som var
      overleveret eder fra Fædrene,
 19.  men med Kristi dyrebare Blod som et lydeløst og uplettet Lams,
 20.  han, som var forud kendt for Verdens Grundlæggelse, men blev
      åbenbaret ved Tidernes Ende for eders Skyld,
 21.  der ved ham tro på Gud, som oprejste ham fra de døde og gav ham
      Herlighed, så at eders Tro også er Håb til Gud.

 22.  Lutrer eders Sjæle i Lydighed imod Sandheden til uskrømtet
      Broderkærlighed, og elsker hverandre inderligt af Hjertet,
 23.  genfødte, som I ere, ikke af forkrænkelig, men af uforkrænkelig
      Sæd, ved Guds levende og blivende Ord.
 24.  Thi "alt Kød er som Græs, og al dets Herlighed som Græssets
      Blomst; Græsset visner, og Blomsten falder af;
 25.  men Herrens Ord bliver evindelig." Og dette er det Ord, som er
      forkyndt eder ved Evangeliet.

1.Peter 2

  1.  Derfor aflægger al Ondskab og al Svig og Hykleri og Avind og al
      Bagtalelse,
  2.  og higer som nyfødte Børn efter Ordets uforfalskede Mælk, for at
      I kunne vokse ved den til Frelse,
  3.  om I da have smagt, at Herren er god.
  4.  Kommer til ham, den levende Sten, der vel er forkastet af
      Menneskene, men er udvalgt og dyrebar for Gud,
  5.  og lader eder selv som levende Sten opbygge som et åndeligt Hus,
      til et helligt Præsteskab, til at frembære åndelige Ofre,
      velbehagelige for Gud ved Jesus Kristus.
  6.  Thi det hedder i et Skriftsted: "Se, jeg lægger i Zion en
      Hovedhjørnesten, som er udvalgt og dyrebar; og den, som tror på
      ham, skal ingenlunde blive til Skamme."
  7.  Eder altså, som tro, hører Æren til; men for de vantro er denne
      Sten, som Bygningsmændene forkastede, bleven til en
      Hovedhjørnesten og en Anstødssten og en Forargelses Klippe;
  8.  og de støde an, idet de ere genstridige imod Ordet, hvortil de
      også vare bestemte.
  9.  Men I ere en udvalgt Slægt, et kongeligt Præsteskab, et helligt
      Folk, et Folk til Ejendom, for at I skulle forkynde hans Dyder,
      som kaldte eder fra Mørke til sit underfulde Lys,
 10.  I, som fordum ikke vare et Folk, men nu ere Guds Folk, I, som
      ikke fandt Barmhjertighed, men nu have fundet Barmhjertighed.

 11.  I elskede! jeg formaner eder som fremmede og Udlændinge til at
      afolde eder fra kødelige Lyster, som jo føre Krig imod Sjælen,
 12.  så I føre en god Vandel iblandt Hedningerne, for at de på Grund
      af de gode Gerninger, som de få at se, kunne prise Gud på
      Besøgelsens Dag for det, som de bagtale eder for som
      Ugerningsmænd.

 13.  Underordner eder under al menneskelig Ordning for Herrens Skyld,
      være sig en Konge som den højeste,
 14.  eller Landshøvdinger som dem, der sendes af ham til Straf for
      Ugerningsmænd, men til Ros for dem, som gøre det gode.
 15.  Thi således er det Guds Villie, at I ved at gøre det gode skulle
      bringe de uforstandige Menneskers Vankundighed til at tie;
 16.  som frie, og ikke som de, der have Friheden til Ondskabs Skjul,
      men som Guds Tjenere.
 17.  Ærer alle, elsker Broderskabet, frygter Gud, ærer Kongen!

 18.  I Trælle! underordner eder under eders Herrer i al Frygt, ikke
      alene de gode og milde, men også de urimelige.
 19.  Thi dette finder Yndest, dersom nogen, bunden til Gud i sin
      Samvittighed, udholder Genvordigheder, skønt han lider
      uretfærdigt.
 20.  Thi hvad Ros er det, om I holde ud, når I Synde og derfor få
      Næveslag? Men dersom I holde ud, når I gøre det gode og lide
      derfor, dette finder Yndest hos Gud.
 21.  Thi dertil bleve I kaldede, efterdi også Kristus har lidt for
      eder, efterladende eder et Forbillede, for at I skulle følge i
      hans Fodspor,
 22.  han, som ikke gjorde Synd, ikke heller blev der fundet Svig i
      hans Mund,
 23.  han, som ikke skældte igen, da han blev udskældt, ikke truede,
      da han led, men overgav det til ham, som dømmer retfærdigt,
 24.  han, som selv bar vore Synder på sit Legeme op på Træet, for at
      vi, afdøde fra vore Synder, skulle leve for Retfærdigheden, han,
      ved hvis Sår I ere blevne lægte.
 25.  Thi I vare vildfarende som Får, men ere nu vendte om til eders
      Sjæles Hyrde og Tilsynsmand.

1.Peter 3

  1.  Ligeså, I Hustruer! underordner eder under eders egne Mænd, for
      at, selv om nogle ere genstridige imod Ordet, de kunne vindes
      uden Ord ved Hustruernes Vandel,
  2.  når de iagttage eders kyske Vandel i Frygt.
  3.  Eders Prydelse skal ikke være den udvortes med Hårfletning og
      påhængte Guldsmykker eller Klædedragt,
  4.  men Hjertets skjulte Menneske med den sagtmodige og stille Ånds
      uforkrænkelige Prydelse, hvilket er meget kosteligt for Gud.
  5.  Thi således var det også, at fordum de hellige Kvinder, som
      håbede på Gud, prydede sig, idet de underordnede sig under deres
      egne Mænd,
  6.  som Sara var Abraham lydig, så hun kaldte ham Herre, hun, hvis
      Børn I ere blevne, når I gøre det gode og ikke frygte nogen
      Rædsel.
  7.  Ligeså I Mænd! lever med Forstand sammen med eders Hustruer som
      med et svagere Kar, og beviser dem Ære som dem, der også ere
      Medarvinger til Livets Nådegave, for at eders Bønner ikke skulle
      hindres.

  8.  Og til Slutning værer alle enssindede, medlidende, kærlige imod
      Brødrene, barmhjertige, ydmyge;
  9.  betaler ikke ondt med ondt, eller Skældsord med Skældsord, men
      tværtimod velsigner, thi dertil bleve I kaldede, at I skulle
      arve Velsignelse.
 10.  Thi "den, som vil elske Livet og se gode Dage, skal holde sin
      Tunge fra ondt og sine Læber fra at tale Svig;
 11.  han vende sig fra ondt og gøre godt; han søge Fred og jage efter
      den!
 12.  Thi Herrens Øjne ere over de retfærdige, og hans Øren til deres
      Bøn; men Herrens Ansigt er over dem, som gøre ondt."

 13.  Og hvem er der, som kan volde eder ondt, dersom I ere nidkære
      for det gode?
 14.  Men om I også måtte lide for Retfærdigheds Skyld, er I salige.
      Nærer ingen Frygt for dem, og forfærdes ikke;
 15.  men helliger den Herre Kristus i eders Hjerter, altid rede til
      at forsvare eder over for enhver, som kræver eder til Regnskab
      for det Håb, der er i eder, men med Sagtmodighed og Frygt,
 16.  idet I have en god Samvittighed, for at de, der laste eders gode
      Vandel i Kristus, må blive til Skamme, når de bagtale eder som
      Ugerningsmænd.
 17.  Thi det er bedre, om det så er Guds Villie, at lide, når man gør
      godt, end når man gør ondt.
 18.  Thi også Kristus led een Gang for Synder, en retfærdig for
      uretfærdige, for at han kunde føre os hen til Gud, han, som led
      Døden i Kødet, men blev levendegjort i Ånden,
 19.  i hvilken han også gik hen og prædikede for Ånderne, som vare i
      Forvaring,
 20.  som fordum vare genstridige, dengang Guds Langmodighed ventede i
      Noas Dage, medens Arken byggedes, i hvilken få, nemlig otte,
      Sjæle bleve frelste igennem Vand,
 21.  hvilket nu også frelser eder i sit Modbillede som Dåb, der ikke
      er Fjernelse af Kødets Urenhed, men en god Samvittigheds Pagt
      med Gud ved Jesu Kristi Opstandelse,
 22.  han, som er faren til Himmelen og er ved Guds højre Hånd, efter
      at Engle og Myndigheder og Kræfter ere ham underlagte.

1.Peter 4

  1.  Efterdi da Kristus har lidt i Kødet, så skulle også I væbne eder
      med det samme Sind (thi den, som har lidt i Kødet, er hørt op
      med Synd),
  2.  så at I ikke fremdeles leve den øvrige Tid i Kødet efter
      Menneskers Lyster, men efter Guds Villie.
  3.  Thi det er nok i den forbigangne Tid at have gjort Hedningernes
      Villie, idet I have vandret i Uterlighed, Lyster, Fylderi, Svir,
      Drik og skammelig Afgudsdyrkelse;
  4.  hvorfor de forundre sig og spotte, når I ikke løbe med til den
      samme Ryggesløshedens Pøl;
  5.  men de skulle gøre ham Regnskab, som er rede til at dømme
      levende og døde.
  6.  Thi derfor blev Evangeliet forkyndt også for døde, for at de vel
      skulde være dømte på Menneskers Vis i Kødet, men leve på Guds
      Vis i Ånden.

  7.  Men alle Tings Ende er kommen nær; værer derfor årvågne og ædru
      til Bønner!
  8.  Hav fremfor alt en inderlig Kærlighed til hverandre; thi
      "Kærlighed skjuler en Mangfoldighed af Synder".
  9.  Vær gæstfri imod hverandre uden Knurren.
 10.  Eftersom enhver har fået en Nådegave, skulle I tjene hverandre
      dermed som gode Husholdere over Guds mangfoldige Nåde.
 11.  Taler nogen, han tale som Guds Ord; har nogen en Tjeneste, han
      tjene, efter som Gud forlener ham Styrke dertil, for at Gud må
      æres i alle Ting ved Jesus Kristus, hvem Herligheden og Magten
      tilhører i Evighedernes Evigheder! Amen.

 12.  I elskede! undrer eder ikke over den Ild, som brænder iblandt
      eder til eders Prøvelse, som om der hændtes eder noget
      underligt;
 13.  men glæder eder i samme Mål, som I have Del i Kristi Lidelser,
      for at I også kunne glæde og fryde eder ved hans Herligheds
      Åbenbarelse.
 14.  Dersom I hånes for Kristi Navns Skyld, ere I salige; thi
      Herlighedens og Guds Ånd hviler over eder.
 15.  Thi ingen af eder bør lide som Morder eller Tyv eller
      Ugerningsmand eller som en, der blander sig i anden Mands Sager;
 16.  men lider han som en Kristen, da skamme han sig ikke, men prise
      Gud for dette Navn!

 17.  Thi det er Tiden til, at Dommen skal begynde med Guds Hus: men
      begynder den først med os, hvad Ende vil det da få med dem, som
      ere genstridige imod Guds Evangelium?
 18.  Og dersom den retfærdige med Nød og neppe bliver frelst, hvor
      skal da den ugudelige og Synderen blive af?
 19.  Derfor skulle også de, som lide efter Guds Villie, befale den
      trofaste Skaber deres Sjæle, idet de gøre det gode.

1.Peter 5

  1.  De Ældste iblandt eder formaner jeg som Medældste og Vidne til
      Kristi Lidelser, som den, der også har Del i Herligheden, der
      skal åbenbares:
  2.  Vogter Guds Hjord hos eder, og fører Tilsyn med den, ikke
      tvungne, men frivilligt, ikke for slet Vindings Skyld, men med
      Redebonhed;
  3.  ikke heller som de, der ville herske over Menighederne, men som
      Mønstre for Hjorden;
  4.  og når da Overhyrden åbenbares, skulle I få Herlighedens
      uvisnelige Krans.
  5.  Ligeså, I unge! underordner eder under de ældre; og ifører eder
      alle Ydmyghed imod hverandre; thi "Gud står de hoffærdige imod,
      men de ydmyge giver han Nåde."
  6.  Derfor ydmyger eder under Guds vældige Hånd, for at han i sin
      Tid må ophøje eder.
  7.  Kaster al eders Sørg på ham, thi han har Omsorg for eder.
  8.  Vær ædru, våger; eders Modstander, Djævelen, går omkring som en
      brølende Løve, søgende, hvem han kan opsluge.
  9.  Står ham imod, faste i Troen, vidende, at de samme Lidelser
      fuldbyrdes på eders Brødre i Verden.

 10.  Men al Nådes Gud, som kaldte eder til sin evige Herlighed i
      Kristus Jesus efter en kort Tids Lidelse, han vil selv fuldelig
      berede eder, styrke, bekræfte, grundfæste eder!
 11.  Ham tilhører Magten i Evighedernes Evigheder! Amen.
 12.  Med Silvanus, den trofaste Broder (thi det holder jeg ham for),
      har jeg i Korthed skrevet eder til for at formane og bevidne, at
      dette er Guds sande Nåde, hvori I stå.
 13.  Den medudvalgte i Babylon og min Søn, Markus, hilser eder.
 14.  Hilser hverandre med Kærligheds Kys! Fred være med eder alle,
      som ere i Kristus!


2.Peter

2.Peter 1

  1.  Simon Peter, Jesu Kristi Tjener og Apostel, til dem, der have
      fået samme dyrebare Tro som vi ved vor Guds og Frelsers Jesu
      Kristi Retfærdighed:
  2.  Nåde og Fred vorde eder mangfoldig til Del i Erkendelse af Gud
      og vor Herre Jesus.

  3.  Såsom hans guddommelige Magt har skænket os alt, hvad der hører
      til Liv og Gudfrygtighed ved Erkendelsen af ham, som kaldte os
      ved sin Herlighed og Kraft,
  4.  hvorved han har skænket os de største og dyrebare Forjættelser,
      for at I ved disse skulle få Del i guddommelig Natur, når I
      undfly Fordærvelsen i Verden, som har sin Grund i Begær,
  5.  så anvender just derfor al Flid på i eders Tro at udvise Dyd og
      i Dyden Kundskab
  6.  og i Kundskaben Afholdenhed og i Afholdenheden Udholdenhed og i
      Udholdenheden Gudsfrygt
  7.  og i Gudsfrygten Broderkærlighed og i Broderkærligheden
      Kærlighed.
  8.  Thi når dette findes hos eder og er i Tiltagen, lader det eder
      ikke stå ørkesløse eller ufrugtbare i Erkendelsen af vor Herre
      Jesus Kristus;
  9.  den nemlig, som ikke har dette, er blind, svagsynet, idet han
      har glemt Renselsen fra sine fordums Synder.
 10.  Derfor, Brødre! gører eder des mere Flid for at befæste eders
      Kaldelse og Udvælgelse; thi når I gøre dette, skulle I ingen
      Sinde støde an.
 11.  Thi så skal der rigelig gives eder Indgang i vor Herres og
      Frelsers Jesu Kristi evige Rige.

 12.  Derfor vil jeg ikke forsømme altid at påminde eder om delte,
      ihvorvel I vide det og ere befæstede i den Sandhed, som er til
      Stede hos os.
 13.  Men jeg anser det for ret at vække eder ved Påmindelse, så længe
      jeg er i dette Telt,
 14.  da jeg ved, at Aflæggelsen af mit Telt kommer brat, således som
      jo vor Herre Jesus Kristus har givet mig til Kende.
 15.  Og jeg vil også gøre mig Flid for, at I til enhver Tid efter min
      Bortgang kunne drage eder dette i Minde.
 16.  Thi vi have ikke fulgt klogtigt opdigtede Fabler, da vi
      kundgjorde eder vor Herres Jesu Kristi Kraft og Tilkommelse, men
      vi have været Øjenvidner til hans Majestæt,
 17.  nemlig da han fik Ære og Herlighed af Gud Fader, idet en sådan
      Røst lød til ham fra den majestætiske Herlighed: "Denne er min
      Søn, den elskede, i hvem jeg har Velbehag."
 18.  Og vi hørte denne Røst lyde fra Himmelen, da vi vare med ham på
      det hellige Bjerg.
 19.  Og des mere stadfæstet have vi det profetiske Ord, hvilket I
      gøre vel i at agte på som på et Lys, der skinner på et mørkt
      Sted, indtil Dagen bryder frem, og Morgenstjernen oprinder i
      eders Hjerter,
 20.  idet I fornemmelig mærke eder dette, at ingen Profeti i Skriften
      beror på egen Tydning.
 21.  Thi aldrig er nogen Profeti bleven fremført ved et Menneskes
      Villie; men drevne af den Helligånd talte hellige Guds Mænd.

2.Peter 2

  1.  Men der opstod også falske Profeter iblandt Folket, ligesom der
      også iblandt eder vil komme falske Lærere, som ville liste
      fordærvelige Vranglærdomme ind, idet de endog fornægte den
      Herre, som købte dem, og bringe en brat Undergang over sig selv,
  2.  og mange ville efterfølge deres Uterligheder, så Sandhedens Vej
      for deres Skyld vil blive bespottet,
  3.  og i Havesyge ville de med falske Ord skaffe sig Vinding af
      eder; men Dommen over dem har alt fra gamle Dage været i
      Virksomhed, og deres Undergang slumrer ikke.

  4.  Thi når Gud ikke sparede Engle, da de syndede, men nedstyrtede
      dem i Afgrunden og overgav dem til Mørkets Huler for at bevogtes
      til Dom,
  5.  og ikke sparede den gamle Verden, men bevarede Retfærdighedens
      Prædiker Noa selv ottende, da han førte Oversvømmelse over en
      Verden af ugudelige
  6.  og lagde Sodomas og Gomorras Stæder i Aske og domfældte dem til
      Ødelæggelse, så han har sat dem til Forbillede for dem, som i
      Fremtiden ville leve ugudeligt,
  7.  og udfriede den retfærdige Lot, som plagedes af de ryggesløses
      uterlige Vandel,
  8.  (thi medens den retfærdige boede iblandt dem, pintes han Dag for
      Dag i sin retfærdige Sjæl ved de lovløse Gerninger, som han så
      og hørte):
  9.  - da ved Herren at udfri gudfrygtige af Fristelse, men at
      straffe og bevogte uretfærdige til Dommens Dag,
 10.  og mest dem, som vandre efter Kød, i Begær efter Besmittelse, og
      foragte Herskab. Frække, selvbehagelige, bæve de ikke ved at
      bespotte Herligheder,
 11.  hvor dog Engle, som ere større i Styrke og Magt, ikke fremføre
      bespottende Dom imod dem for Herren.
 12.  Men disse ligesom ufornuftige Dyr, der af Natur ere fødte til at
      fanges og ødelægges, skulle de, fordi de bespotte, hvad de ikke
      kende, også ødelægges med hines Ødelæggelse,
 13.  idet de få Uretfærdigheds Løn. De sætte deres Lyst i Vellevned
      om Dagen, disse Skampletter og Skændselsmennesker! De svælge i
      deres Bedragerier, medens de holde Gilde med eder;
 14.  deres Øjne ere fulde af Horeri og kunne ikke få nok af Synd; de
      lokke ubefæstede Sjæle; de have et Hjerte, øvet i Havesyge,
      Forbandelsens Børn;
 15.  de have forladt den lige Vej og ere farne vild, følgende
      Bileams, Beors Søns, Vej, han, som elskede Uretfærdigheds Løn,
 16.  men fik Revselse for sin Overtrædelse: et umælende Trældyr talte
      med menneskelig Røst og hindrede Profetens Afsind.
 17.  Disse ere vandløse Kilder og Tågeskyer, som drives af Storvind;
      for dem er Mørke og Mulm bevaret.
 18.  Thi dem, som ere lige ved at undslippe fra dem, der vandre i
      Vildfarelse, løkke de i Kødets Begæringer ved Uterligheder, idet
      de tale Tomheds overmodige Ord
 19.  og love dem Frihed, skønt de selv ere Fordærvelsens Trælle; thi
      man er Træl af det, som man er overvunden af.
 20.  Thi dersom de, efter at have undflyet Verdens Besmittelser ved
      Erkendelse af vor Herre og Frelser Jesus Kristus, igen lade sig
      indvikle deri og overvindes, da er det sidste blevet værre med
      dem end det første.
 21.  Thi bedre havde det været dem ikke at have erkendt
      Retfærdighedens Vej end efter at have erkendt den at vende sig
      bort fra det hellige Bud, som var blevet dem overgivet.
 22.  Det er gået dem efter det sande Ordsprog: "Hunden vender sig om
      til sit eget Spy, og den toede So til at vælte sig i Sølen."

2.Peter 3

  1.  Dette er allerede, I elskede! det andet Brev, som jeg skriver
      til eder, hvori jeg ved Påmindelse vækker eders rene Sind
  2.  til at komme de Ord i Hu, som forud ere sagte af de hellige
      Profeter, og eders Apostles Befaling fra Herren og Frelseren,
  3.  idet I først og fremmest mærke eder dette, at i de sidste Dage
      skal der komme Spottere med Spot, som vandre efter deres egne
      Begæringer
  4.  og sige: "Hvad bliver der af Forjættelsen om hans Tilkommelse?
      Fra den Dag, Fædrene sov hen, forblive jo alle Ting, som de
      vare, lige fra Skabningens Begyndelse."
  5.  Thi med Villie ere de blinde for dette, at fra fordums Tid var
      der Himle og en Jord, som var fremstået af Vand og ved Vand i
      Kraft af Guds Ord,
  6.  hvorved den daværende Verden gik til Grunde i en Vandflod.
  7.  Men de nuværende Himle og Jorden holdes ved det samme Ord i
      Forvaring til Ild, idet de bevares til de ugudelige Menneskers
      Doms og Undergangs Dag.
  8.  Men dette ene bør ikke undgå eder, I elskede! at een Dag er for
      Herren som tusinde År, og tusinde År som een Dag.
  9.  Herren forhaler ikke Forjættelsen (som nogle agte det for en
      Forhaling), men han er langmodig for eders Skyld, idet han ikke
      vil, at nogen skal fortabes, men at alle skulle komme til
      Omvendelse.
 10.  Men Herrens Dag skal komme som en Tyv; på den skulle Himlene
      forgå med stort Bulder, og Elementerne skulle komme i Brand og
      opløses, og Jorden og alt, hvad der er på den, skal opbrændes.

 11.  Efterdi da alt dette opløses, hvor bør I da ikke færdes i hellig
      Vandel og Gudsfrygt,
 12.  idet I forvente og fremskynde Guds Dags Tilkommelse, for hvis
      Skyld Himle skulle antændes og opløses, og Elementer komme i
      Brand og smelte.
 13.  Men vi forvente efter hans Forjættelse nye Himle og en ny Jord,
      i hvilke Retfærdighed bor.
 14.  Derfor, I elskede! efterdi I forvente dette, så gører eder Flid
      for at findes uplettede og ulastelige for ham i Fred,
 15.  og agter vor Herres Langmodighed for Frelse; ligesom også vor
      elskede Broder Paulus efter den ham givne Visdom har skrevet til
      eder,
 16.  som han også gør i alle sine Breve, når han i dem taler om disse
      Ting; i dem findes der Ting, vanskelige at forstå, som de
      ukyndige og ubefæstede fordreje, ligesom også de øvrige
      Skrifter, til deres egen Undergang.
 17.  Da I altså, I elskede! vide det forud, såvogter eder, for at I
      ikke skulle rives med af de ryggesløses Vildfarelse og affalde
      fra eders egen Fasthed;
 18.  men vokser i vor Herres og Frelsers Jesu Kristi Nåde og
      Kundskab!  Ham tilhører Herligheden både nu og indtil Evighedens
      Dag!


1.Johannes

1.Johannes 1

  1.  Det, som var fra Begyndelsen, det, vi have hørt, det, vi have
      set med vore Øjne, det, vi skuede og vore Hænder følte på,
      nemlig om Livets Ord; -
  2.  og Livet blev åbenbaret, og vi have set og vidne og forkynde
      eder det evige Liv, som jo var hos Faderen og blev åbenbaret for
      os; -
  3.  hvad vi have set og hørt, forkynde vi også eder, for at også I
      må have Samfund med os; men vort Samfund er med Faderen og med
      hans Søn Jesus Kristus.
  4.  Og dette skrive vi til eder, for at eders Glæde må være
      fuldkommen.

  5.  Og dette er det Budskab, som vi have hørt af ham og forkynde
      eder, at Gud er Lys, og der er slet intet Mørke i ham.
  6.  Dersom vi sige, at vi have Samfund med ham, og vandre i Mørket,
      da lyve vi og gøre ikke Sandheden.
  7.  Men dersom vi vandre i Lyset, ligesom han er i Lyset, have vi
      Samfund med hverandre,og Jesu, hans Søns, Blod renser os fra al
      Synd.
  8.  Dersom vi sige, at vi ikke have Synd, bedrage vi os selv, og
      Sandheden er ikke i os.
  9.  Dersom vi bekende vore Synder, er han trofast og retfærdig, så
      at han forlader os Synderne og renser os fra al Uretfærdighed.
 10.  Dersom vi sige, at vi ikke have syndet, gøre vi ham til en
      Løgner, og hans Ord er ikke i os.

1.Johannes 2

  1.  Mine Børn! dette skriver jeg til eder, for at I ikke skulle
      synde.  Og dersom nogen synder, have vi en Talsmand hos Faderen,
      Jesus Kristus, den retfærdige,
  2.  og han er en Forsoning for vore Synder, dog ikke alene for vore,
      men også for hele Verdens.

  3.  Og derpå kende vi, at vi have kendt ham, om vi holde hans Bud.
  4.  Den, som siger: "Jeg kender ham," og ikke holder hans Bud. han
      er en Løgner, og i ham er Sandheden ikke;
  5.  men den, som holder hans Ord, i ham er sandelig Guds Kærlighed
      fuldkommet. Derpå kende vi, at vi ere i ham.
  6.  Den, som siger, at han bliver i ham, han er også skyldig selv at
      vandre således, som han vandrede.
  7.  I elskede, jeg skriver til eder ikke et nyt Bud, men et gammelt
      Bud, som I have haft fra Begyndelsen. Det gamle Bud er det Ord,
      som I have hørt.
  8.  Og dog skriver jeg til eder et nyt Bud, hvilket er sandt i ham
      og i eder, thi Mørket drager bort, og det sande Lys skinner
      allerede.
  9.  Den,som siger,at han er i Lyset,og hader sin Broder, han er i
      Mørket endnu.
 10.  Den, som elsker sin Broder, bliver i Lyset, og der er ingen
      Forargelse i ham.
 11.  Men den, som hader sin Broder, er i Mørket og vandrer i Mørket,
      og han ved ikke, hvor han går hen, fordi Mørket har blindet hans
      Øjne.

 12.  Jeg skriver til eder, mine Børn! fordi eders Synder ere eder
      forladte for hans Navns Skyld.
 13.  Jeg skriver til eder, I Fædre! fordi I kende ham, som er fra
      Begyndelsen. Jeg skriver til eder, I unge! fordi I have
      overvundet den onde. Jeg har skrevet til eder, mine Børn! fordi
      I kende Faderen.
 14.  Jeg har skrevet til eder, I Fædre! fordi I kende ham, som er fra
      Begyndelsen. Jeg har skrevet til eder, I unge! fordi I ere
      stærke, og Guds Ord bliver i eder, og I have overvundet den
      onde.
 15.  Elsker ikke Verden, ikke heller de Ting, som ere i Verden!
      Dersom nogen elsker Verden, er Faderens Kærlighed ikke i ham.
 16.  Thi alt det, som er i Verden, Kødets Lyst og Øjnenes Lyst og
      Livets Hoffærdighed, er ikke af Faderen, men af Verden.
 17.  Og Verden forgår og dens Lyst; men den, som gør Guds Villie,
      bliver til evig Tid.

 18.  Mine Børn! det er den sidste Time, og som I have hørt, at
      Antikrist kommer, således ere nu mange Antikrister fremtrådte;
      deraf kende vi, at det er den sidste Time.
 19.  De ere udgåede fra os, men de vare ikke af os; thi dersom de
      havde været af os, da vare de blevne hos os. Dog, det var, for
      at det skulde blive åbenbart, at de ikke alle ere af os.
 20.  Og I have Salvelse fra den hellige og vide alt.
 21.  Jeg har ikke skrevet til eder, fordi I ikke vide Sandheden; men
      fordi I vide den og vide, at ingen Løgn er af Sandheden.
 22.  Hvem er Løgneren uden den, som nægter, at Jesus er Kristus?
      Denne er Antikristen, som fornægter Faderen og Sønnen.
 23.  Hver den, som fornægter Sønnen, har ej heller Faderen; den, som
      bekender Sønnen, har også Faderen.
 24.  Hvad I have hørt fra Begyndelsen, det blive i eder! Dersom det,
      som I have hørt fra Begyndelsen, bliver i eder, skulle også I
      blive i Sønnen og i Faderen.
 25.  Og dette er den Forjættelse, som han selv tilsagde os, det evige
      Liv.
 26.  Dette har jeg skrevet til eder om dem, som forføre eder.
 27.  Og den Salvelse, som I fik af ham, bliver i eder, og I have ikke
      nødig, at nogen skal lære eder; men således som hans Salvelse
      lærer eder alt, er det også sandt og er ikke Løgn, og som den
      har lært eder, skulle I blive i ham.

 28.  Og nu mine Børn! bliver i ham, for at vi, når han åbenbares,
      kunne have Frimodighed og ikke skulle blive til Skamme for ham
      ved hans Tilkommelse.
 29.  Dersom I vide, at han er retfærdig, da erkender, at hver den,
      som gør Retfærdighed, er født af ham.

1.Johannes 3

  1.  Ser, hvor stor en Kærlighed Faderen har givet os, at vi skulle
      kaldes Guds Børn og vi ere det. Derfor kender Verden os ikke,
      fordi den ikke har kendt ham.
  2.  I elskede! nu ere vi Guds Børn, og det er endnu ikke åbenbaret,
      hvad vi skulle vorde. Vi vide, at når det åbenbares, da skulle
      vi vorde ham lige; thi i skulle se ham, som han er.
  3.  Og hver den, som har dette Håb til ham, renser sig selv, ligesom
      han er ren.
  4.  Hver den, som gør Synden, begår også Overtrædelse af Loven, og
      Synden er Lovens Overtrædelse.
  5.  Og I vide, at han blev åbenbaret for at han skulde borttage
      Synderne; og der er ikke Synd i ham
  6.  Hver den, som bliver i ham, synder ikke; hver den, som
      synder,har ikke set ham og kender ham ej heller.

  7.  Mine Børn, ingen forføre eder! Den, som gør Retfærdigheden, er
      retfærdig, ligesom han er retfærdig.
  8.  Den, som gør Synden, er af Djævelen; thi Djævelen har syndet fra
      Begyndelsen. Dertil blev Guds Søn åbenbaret, for at han skulde
      nedbryde Djævelens Gerninger.
  9.  Hver den, som er født af Gud, gør ikke Synd, fordi hans Sæd
      bliver i ham, og han kan ikke synde, fordi han er født af Gud.
 10.  Derved blive Guds Børn og Djævelens Børn åbenbare. Hver den, som
      ikke gør Retfærdighed, er ikke af Gud, og ligeså den, som ikke
      elsker sin Broder.
 11.  Thi dette er det Budskab, som I have hørt fra Begyndelsen, at vi
      skulle elske hverandre;
 12.  ikke som Kain, der var af den onde og myrdede sin Broder. Og
      hvorfor myrdede han ham? Fordi hans Gerninger vare onde, men
      hans Broders retfærdige.
 13.  Undrer eder ikke, mine Brødre! om Verden hader eder.
 14.  Vi vide, at vi ere gåede over fra Døden til Livet, thi vi elske
      Brødrene. Den, som ikke elsker, bliver i Døden.
 15.  Hver den, som hader sin Broder, er en Manddraber; og I vide, at
      ingen Manddraber har evigt Liv blivende i sig.
 16.  Derpå kende vi Kærligheden, at han har sat sit Liv til for os;
      også vi ere skyldige at sætte Livet til for Brødrene.
 17.  Men den, som bar Verdens Gods og ser sin Broder lide Nød og
      lukker sit Hjerte for ham, hvorledes bliver Guds Kærlighed i
      ham?

 18.  Mine Børn! lader os ikke elske med Ord, ej heller med Tungen,
      men i Gerning og Sandhed!
 19.  Og derpå kunne vi kende, at vi ere af Sandheden, og da kunne vi
      for hans Åsyn stille vore Hjerter tilfreds,
 20.  hvad end vort Hjerte måtte fordømme os for; thi Gud er større
      end vort Hjerte og kender alle Ting.
 21.  I elskede! dersom vort Hjerte ikke fordømmer os, have vi
      Frimodighed for Gud,
 22.  og hvad vi end bede om, det få vi af ham, fordi vi holde hans
      Bud og gøre det, som er velbehageligt for ham.
 23.  Og dette er hans Bud; at vi skulle tro hans Søns Jesu Kristi
      Navn og elske hverandre efter det Bud, han gav os.
 24.  Og den, som holder hans Bud, han bliver i Gud, og Gud i ham; og
      derpå kende vi, at han bliver i os; af den Ånd, som han gav os.

1.Johannes 4

  1.  I elskede! tror ikke enhver Ånd, men prøver Ånderne, om de ere
      af Gud; thi mange falske Profeter ere udgåede i Verden.
  2.  Derpå kende I Guds Ånd: enhver Ånd, der bekender Jesus som
      Kristus, kommen i Kød, er af Gud.
  3.  Og enhver Ånd, der ikke bekender Jesus, er ikke af Gud; og dette
      er Antikrists Ånd, om hvilken I have hørt, at den kommer, og den
      er allerede nu i Verden.
  4.  Mine Børn! I ere af Gud og have overvundet dem, fordi den, som
      er i eder, er større end den, som er i Verden.
  5.  De ere af Verden; derfor tale de af Verden, og Verden hører dem.
  6.  Vi ere af Gud. Den, som kender Gud, hører os; den, som ikke er
      af

  7.  I elskede! lader os elske hverandre, thi Kærligheden er af Gud,
      og hver den, som elsker, er født at Gud og kender Gud.
  8.  Den, som ikke elsker, kender ikke Gud, thi Gud er Kærlighed.
  9.  Deri blev Guds Kærlighed åbenbaret iblandt os, at Gud har sendt
      sin Søn, den enbårne, til Verden, for at vi skulle leve ved ham.
 10.  Deri består Kærligheden: ikke at vi have elsket Gud, men at han
      har elsket os og udsendt sin Søn til en Forsoning for vore
      Synder.
 11.  I elskede! har Gud således elsket os, da ere også vi skyldige at
      elske hverandre.
 12.  Ingen har nogen Sinde set Gud; dersom vi elske hverandre, bliver
      Gud i os, og hans Kærlighed er fuldkommet i os.
 13.  Derpå kende vi, at vi blive i ham, og han i os, at han har givet
      os af sin Ånd.
 14.  Og vi have skuet og vidne, at Faderen bar udsendt Sønnen til
      Frelser for Verden.
 15.  Den, som bekender, at Jesus er Guds Søn, i ham bliver Gud, og
      han i Gud.
 16.  Og vi have erkendt og troet den Kærlighed, som Gud har til
      os. Gud er Kærlighed, og den, som bliver i Kærligheden, bliver i
      Gud, og Gud i ham.
 17.  Deri er Kærligheden fuldkommet hos os, at vi have Frimodighed på
      Dommens Dag, fordi, ligesom han er, således ere også vi i denne
      Verden.
 18.  Frygt er ikke i Kærligheden, men den fuldkomne Kærlighed driver
      Frygten ud; thi Frygt bringer Straf; men den, som frygter, er
      ikke fuldkommet i Kærligheden.
 19.  Vi elske, fordi han elskede os først.
 20.  Dersom nogen siger: "Jeg elsker Gud," og hader sin Broder, han
      er en Løgner; thi den, der ikke elsker sin Broder, som han har
      set, hvorledes kan han elske Gud, som han ikke har set?
 21.  Og dette Bud have vi fra ham, at den, som elsker Gud, skal også
      elske sin Broder.

1.Johannes 5

  1.  Hver den, som tror, at Jesus er Kristus, er født af Gud; og hver
      den, som elsker Faderen, elsker også den, som er født af ham.
  2.  Derpå kende vi, at vi elske Guds Børn, når vi elske Gud og gøre
      hans Bud.
  3.  Thi dette er Kærlighed til Gud, at vi holde hans Bud; og hans
      Bud ere ikke svære;
  4.  thi alt det, som er født af Gud, overvinder Verden; og dette er
      den Sejr, som har overvundet Verden, vor Tro.
  5.  Hvem er den, som overvinder Verden, uden den, som tror, at Jesus
      er Guds Søn?

  6.  Han er den, som kom med Vand og Blod, Jesus Kristus; ikke med
      Vandet alene, men med Vandet og med Blodet; og det er Ånden, som
      viduer, thi Ånden er Sandheden.
  7.  Thi tre ere de, som vidne:
  8.  Ånden og Vandet og Blodet; og disse tre forene sig til eet.
  9.  Dersom vi tage imod Menneskenes Vidnesbyrd, da er Guds Søn.
 10.  Den, som tror på Guds Søn, har Vidnesbyrdet i sig selv; den, som
      ikke tror Gud, har gjort ham til en Løgner, fordi han ikke har
      troet på det Vidnesbyrd, som Gud har vidnet om sin Søn.
 11.  Og dette er Vidnesbyrdet, at Gud har givet os evigt Liv; og
      dette Liv er i hans Søn.
 12.  Den, som har Sønnen, har Livet; den, som ikke har Guds Søn, har
      ikke Livet.

 13.  Dette har jeg skrevet til eder, for at I skulle vide, at I have
      evigt Liv, I, som tro på Guds Søns Navn.
 14.  Og dette er den Frimodighed, som vi have over for ham, at dersom
      vi bede om noget efter hans Villie, hører han os.
 15.  Og dersom vi vide, at han hører os, hvad vi end bede om, da vide
      vi, at vi have de Ting, om hvilke vi have bedt ham.
 16.  Dersom nogen ser sin Broder begå Synd, som ikke er til Døden,
      han bede, og han skal give ham Liv, dem nemlig, som ikke synde
      til Døden.  Der er Synd til Døden; for den siger jeg ikke, at
      han skal bede.
 17.  Al uretfærdighed er synd, men der er synd, som ikke er til
      døden.

 18.  Vi vide, at hver den, som er født af Gud, synder ikke; men den,
      som er født af Gud, bevarer sig selv, og den onde rører ham
      ikke.
 19.  Vi vide, at vi ere af Gud, og hele Verden ligger i det onde.
 20.  Men vi vide, at Guds Søn er kommen, og han har givet os Forstand
      til at kende den sande; og vi ere i den sande, i hans Søn Jesus
      Kristus. Denne er den sande Gud og evigt Liv.
 21.  Mine Børn, vogter eder for Afguderne!


2.Johannes

  1.  Den Ældste til den udvalgte Frue og hendes Børn, som jeg elsker
      i Sandhed, og ikke jeg alene, men også alle, som have erkendt
      Sandheden,
  2.  for den Sandheds Skyld, som bliver i os og skal være med os til
      evig Tid.
  3.  Nåde, Barmhjertighed og Fred være med os fra Gud Fader og fra
      Jesus Kristus, Faderens Søn, i Sandhed og Kærlighed!

  4.  Jeg har glædet mig meget over, at jeg har fundet Børn af dig,
      som vandre i Sandhed, efter det Bud, vi fik af Faderen.
  5.  Og nu beder jeg dig, Frue! ikke som om jeg skrev til dig et nyt
  6.  Og dette er Kærligheden, at vi vandre efter hans Bud. Dette er
      Budet, således som I have hørt fra Begyndelsen, at I skulle
      vandre deri.

  7.  Thi mange Forførere ere udgåede i Verden, som ikke bekende Jesus
      som Kristus kommen i Kød. En sådan er Forføreren og Antikrist.
  8.  Giver Agt på eder selv, at I ikke skulle tabe, hvad vi have
      arbejdet, men at I må få fuld Løn.
  9.  Hver den, som viger ud og ikke bliver i Kristi Lære, har ikke
      Gud.  Den, som bliver i Læren, han har både Faderen og Sønnen.
 10.  Dersom nogen kommer til eder og ikke fører denne Lære, ham
      skulle I ikke tage til Huse og ikke byde velkommen.
 11.  Thi den, som byder ham velkommen, bliver delagtig i hans onde
      Gerninger.

 12.  Endskønt jeg havde meget at skrive til eder, har jeg ikke villet
      det med Papir og Blæk; men jeg håber at komme til eder og tale
      mundtligt med eder, for at vor Glæde må være fuldkommen.
 13.  Din Søsters, den udvalgtes, Børn hilse dig.


3.Johannes

  1.  Den Ældste til Kajus, den elskede, hvem jeg elsker i Sandhed.
  2.  Du elskede! jeg ønsker, at det i alle Ting må gå dig vel, og du
      må være karsk, ligesom det går din Sjæl vel.

  3.  Thi jeg blev meget glad, da der kom Brødre og vidnede om
      Sandheden i dig, hvorledes du vandrer i Sandheden.
  4.  Jeg har ingen større Glæde end denne, at jeg hører, at mine Børn
      vandre i Sandheden.
  5.  Du elskede! en trofast Gerning gør du i alt, hvad du virker for
      Brødrene, og det for femmede,
  6.  hvilke have vidnet for Menigheden om din Kærlighed; og du vil
      gøre vel i at fremme deres Rejse således, som det er Gud
      værdigt.
  7.  Thi for Navnets Skyld ere de dragne ud, uden at tage noget at
      Hedningerne.
  8.  Derfor ere vi skyldige at tage os af sådanne, for at vi kunne
      blive Medarbejdere for Sandheden.

  9.  Jeg har skrevet noget til Menigheden; men Diotrefes, som gerne
      vil være den ypperste iblandt dem, anerkender os ikke.
 10.  Derfor vil jeg, når jeg kommer erindre om de Gerninger, han gør,
      idet han bagvasker os med onde Ord; og ikke tilfreds dermed,
      tager han både selv ikke Brødrene for gode, og dem, som ville
      det, forhindrer han deri og udstøder dem af Menigheden.
 11.  Du elskede! efterfølg ikke det onde, men det gode. Den, som gør
      godt, er af Gud; den, som gør ondt, har ikke set Gud.

 12.  Demetrius har et godt Vidnesbyrd af alle og af Sandheden selv;
      også vi vidne, og du ved, at vort Vidnesbyrd er sandt.

 13.  Jeg havde meget at skrive til dig, men jeg vil ikke skrive til
      dig med Blæk og Pen.
 14.  Men jeg håber snart at se dig, og da skulle vi mundtligt tale
      sammen.
 15.  Fred være med dig! Vennerne hilse dig. Hils Vennerne, hver især!

Judas

  1.  Judas, Jesu Kristi Tjener og Broder til Jakob, til de kaldede,
      som ere elskede i Gud Fader og bevarede for Jesus Kristus:
  2.  Barmhjertighed og Fred og Kærlighed vorde eder mangfoldig til
      Del!

  3.  I elskede! da det lå mig alvorligt på Sinde at skrive til eder
      om vor fælles Frelse, fandt jeg det nødvendigt at skrive til
      eder med Formaning om at stride for den Tro, som een Gang er
      bleven overgiven de hellige.
  4.  Thi der har indsneget sig nogle Mennesker, om hvem det for længe
      siden er forud skrevet, at de vilde falde under denne Dom:
      Ugudelige, som misbruge vor, Guds Nåde til Uterlighed og
      fornægte vor eneste Hersker og Herre Jesus Kristus.

  5.  Men skønt I een Gang for alle vide det alt sammen, vil jeg minde
      eder om, at da Herren havde frelst Folket ud af Ægyptens Land,
      ødelagde han næste Gang dem, som ikke troede,
  6.  og de Engle, som ikke bevarede deres Højhed, men forlode deres
      egen Bolig, bar han holdt forvarede i evige Lænker under Mørke
      til den store Dags Dom;
  7.  ligesom Sodoma og Gomorra og de omliggende Stæder, der på samme
      Måde som disse vare henfaldne til Utugt og gik efter fremmed
      Kød), ere satte til et Eksempel, idet de bære en evig Ilds
      Straf.
  8.  Alligevel gå også disse ligedan i Drømme og besmitte Kød,
      foragte Herskab og bespotte Herligheder.
  9.  Men Overengelen Mikael turde, da han tvistedes med Djævelen og
      talte om Mose Legeme, ikke fremføre en Bespottelsesdom, men
      sagde: "Herren straffe dig!"
 10.  Disse derimod bespotte, hvad de ikke kende; og hvad de som de
      ufornuftige Dyr vide Besked om af Naturen, dermed ødelægge de
      sig selv.
 11.  Ve dem! thi de ere gåede på Kains Vej og have styrtet sig i
      Bileams Vildfarelse for Vindings Skyld og ere gåede til Grunde i
      Horas Genstridighed.
 12.  Disse ere Skærene ved eders Kærlighedsmåltider, fordi de uden
      Undseelse frådse med og pleje sig selv; de ere vandløse Skyer,
      som drives forbi af Vinden; bladløse Træer uden Frugt, to Gange
      døde, oprykkede med Rode;
 13.  vilde Bølger på Hav, som udskumme deres egen Skam; vild farende
      Stjerner; for dem er Mørke og Mulm bevaret til evig Tid.

 14.  Men om disse har også Enok, den syvende fra Adam, profeteret, da
      han sagde: "Se, Herren kom med sine hellige Titusinder
 15.  for at holde Dom over alle og straffe alle de ugudelige for alle
      deres Ugudeligheds Gerninger, som de have bedrevet, og for alle
      de formastelige Ord, som de have talt imod ham, de ugudelige
      Syndere!"
 16.  Disse ere de, som knurre, som klage over deres Skæbne, medens de
      vandre efter deres Begæringer, og deres Mund taler overmodige
      Ord, medens de for Fordels Skyld vise Beundring for Personer.

 17.  I derimod, I elskede! kommer de Ord i Hu, som forud ere talte af
      vor Herres Jesu Kristi Apostle;
 18.  thi de sagde eder: I den sidste Tid skal der være Spottere, som
      vandre efter deres Ugudeligheders Begæringer.
 19.  Disse ere de, som volde Splittelser, sjælelige, som ikke have
      Ånd.
 20.  I derimod, I elskede! opbygger eder selv på eders helligste Tro;
      beder i den Helligånd;
 21.  bevarer således eder selv i Guds Kærlighed, forventende vor
      Herres Jesu Kristi Barmhjertighed til evigt Liv.
 22.  Og revser nogle, når de tvivle,
 23.  frelser andre ved at udrive dem af Ilden, forbarmer eder over
      andre med Frygt, så I hade endog den af Kødet besmittede
      Kjortel.

 24.  Men ham, som er mægtig til at bevare eder fra Fald og fremstille
      eder for sin Herlighed ulastelige i Fryd,
 25.  den eneste Gud, vor Frelser ved vor Herre Jesus Kristus,
      tilkommer Ære og Majestæt, Vælde og Magt, forud for al Tid og nu
      og i alle Evigheder! Amen.


Aabenbaringen

Aabenbaringen 1

  1.  Jesu Kristi Åbenbaring, som Gud gav ham for at vise sine
      Tjenere, hvad der skal ske snart, og han sendte Bud ved sin
      Engel og fremstillede det i Billeder for sin Tjener Johannes,
  2.  som har vidnet om Guds Ord og Jesu Kristi Vidnesbyrd: Alt, hvad
      han har set.
  3.  Salig er den, som oplæser, og de, som høre Profetiens Ord og
      bevare det, som er skrevet i den; thi Tiden er nær.

  4.  Johannes til de syv Menigheder i Asien: Nåde være med eder og
      Fred fra ham, som er, og som var, og som kommer, og fra de syv
      Ånder, som ere foran hans Trone,
  5.  og fra Jesus Kristus, det troværdige Vidne, den førstefødte af
      de døde og Jordens Kongers Fyrste. Ham, som elsker os og har
      udløst os af vore Synder med sit Blod
  6.  og har gjort os til et Kongerige, til Præster for sin Gud og
      Fader: Ham være Æren og Magten i Evighedernes Evigheder! Amen.

  7.  Se, han kommer med Skyerne, og hvert Øje skal se ham, også de,
      som have gennemstunget ham, og alle Jordens Stammer skulle jamre
      ved hans Komme. Ja, Amen!
  8.  Jeg er Alfa og Omega, siger Gud Herren, han, som er, og som var,
      og som kommer, den Almægtige.

  9.  Jeg Johannes, eders Broder og meddelagtig i Trængselen og Riget
      og Udholdenheden i Jesus, var på den Ø, som kaldes Patmos, for
      Guds Ords og for Jesu Vidnesbyrds Skyld.
 10.  Jeg henryktes i Ånden på Herrens Dag, og jeg hørte bag mig en
      høj Røst som af en Basun, der sagde:
 11.  Hvad du ser, skriv det i en Bog, og send det til de syv
      Menigheder, til Efesus og til Smyrna og til Pergamus og til
      Thyatira og til Sardes og til Filidelfia og til Laodikea.
 12.  Og jeg vendte mig for at se Røsten, som talte med mig; og da jeg
      vendte mig, så jeg syv Guldlysestager
 13.  og midt imellem de syv Lysestager en, lig en Menneskesøn, iført
      en fodsid Kjortel og omgjordet om Brystet med et Guldbælte.
 14.  Men hans Hoved og Hår var hvidt som hvid Uld, som Sne; og hans
      Øjne som Ildslue;
 15.  og hans Fødder lignede skinnende Malm, når det gløder i Ovnen;
      og hans Røst var som mange Vandes Lyd;
 16.  og i sin højre Hånd havde han syv Stjerner; og af hans Mund
      udgik der et tveægget, skarpt Sværd, og hans Udseende var som
      Solen, når den skinner i sin Kraft.
 17.  Og da jeg så ham, faldt jeg ned for hans Fødder som død; og han
      lagde sin højre Hånd på mig og sagde:
 18.  Frygt ikke! Jeg er den første og den sidste og den levende; og
      jeg var død, og se, jeg er levende i Evighedernes Evigheder, og
      jeg har Dødens og Dødsrigets Nøgler.
 19.  Skriv derfor, hvad du så, både det, som er, og det, som skal ske
      herefter.
 20.  Dette er de syv Stjerners Hemmelighed, hvilke du har set i min
      højre Hånd, og de syv Guldlysestager: de syv Stjerner ere de syv
      Menigheders Engle, og de syv Lysestager ere syv Menigheder.

Aabenbaringen 2

  1.  Skriv til Menighedens Engel i Efesus: Dette siger han, som
      holder de syv Stjerner i sin højre Hånd, ham, som vandrer midt
      imellem de syv Guldlysestager:
  2.  Jeg kender dine Gerninger og dit Arbejde og din Udholdenhed, og
      at du ikke kan fordrage de onde; og du prøvede dem, som kalde
      sig selv Apostle og ikke ere det, og du har fundet, at de ere
      Løgnere;
  3.  og du har Udholdenhed, og du har døjet ondt for mit Navns Skyld
      og er ikke bleven træt.
  4.  Men jeg har det imod dig, at du har forladt din første
      Kærlighed.
  5.  Kom derfor i Hu, hvorfra du er falden, og omvend dig, og gør de
      forrige Gerninger; men hvis ikke, da kommer jeg over dig, og jeg
      vil flytte din Lysestage fra dens Sted, hvis du ikke omvender
      dig.
  6.  Dog, dette har du, at du hader Nikolaiternes Gerninger, som også
      jeg hader.
  7.  Den, som har Øre, høre, hvad Ånden siger til Menighederne! Den,
      som sejrer, ham vil jeg give at æde af Livets Træ, som er i Guds
      Paradis.

  8.  Og skriv til Menighedens Engel i Smyrna: Dette siger den første
      og den sidste, han, som var død og blev levende:
  9.  Jeg kender din Trængsel og din Fattigdom (dog, du er rig), og
      Bespottelsen fra dem, som kalde sig selv Jøder og ikke ere det,
      men ere Satans Synagoge.
 10.  Frygt ikke, for hvad du vil komme til at lide! Se, Djævelen vil
      kaste nogle af eder i Fængsel, for at I skulle fristes, og I
      skulle have Trængsel i ti Dage. Vær tro indtil Døden, så vil jeg
      give dig Livets Krone
 11.  Den, som har Øre, høre, hvad Ånden siger til Menighederne! Den,
      som sejrer, skal ingenlunde skades af den anden Død.

 12.  Og skriv til Menighedens Engel i Pergamus: Dette siger han, som
      har det tveæggede, skarpe Sværd:
 13.  Jeg ved, hvor du bor, der, hvor Satans Trone er; og du holder
      fast ved mit Navn og fornægtede ikke min Tro, i Antipas's, mit
      tro Vidnes Dage, han, som blev ihjelslået hos eder, der, hvor
      Satan bor.
 14.  Men jeg har noget lidet imod dig, at du har nogle hos dig, som
      holde fast ved Bileams Lære, der lærte Balak at sætte Snare for
      Israels Børn, for at de skulde spise Afgudsofferkød og bedrive
      Utugt.
 15.  Således har også du dem, som holde fast ved Nikolaiternes Lære
      på lignende Vis.
 16.  Omvend dig! Men hvis ikke, kommer jeg snart over dig og vil
      stride imod dem med min Munds Sværd.
 17.  Den, som har Øre, høre, hvad Ånden siger til Menighederne! Den,
      som sejrer, ham vil jeg give af den skjulte Manna, og jeg vil
      give ham en hvid Sten og på Stenen et nyt Navn skrevet, som
      ingen kender, uden den, der får det.

 18.  Og skriv til Menighedens Engel i Thyatira: Dette siger Guds Søn,
      der har Øjne som Ildslue, og hvis Fødder ere som skinnende Malm:
 19.  Jeg kender dine Gerninger og din Kærlighed og Tro og Tjeneste og
      Udholdenhed, ja, dine Gerninger, de sidste flere end de første.
 20.  Men jeg har imod dig, at du finder dig i Kvinden Jesabel, som
      kalder sig selv en Profetinde og lærer og forfører mine Tjenere
      til at bedrive Utugt og spise Afgudsofferkød.
 21.  Og jeg har givet hende Tid til at omvende sig, men hun vil ikke
      omvende sig fra sin Utugt.
 22.  Se, jeg kaster hende på Sygelejet og hendes Bolere i stor
      Trængsel, dersom de ikke omvende sig fra deres Gerninger.
 23.  Og hendes Børn vil jeg slå med Død, og alle Menighederne skulle
      kende, at jeg er den, som ransager Nyrer og Hjerter; og jeg vil
      give eder, hver efter eders Gerninger.
 24.  Men til eder, de øvrige, som ere i Thyatira, så mange som ikke
      have denne Lære, fordi de ikke kende Satans Dybder, som de kalde
      det, til eder siger jeg: Jeg lægger ingen anden Byrde på eder.
 25.  Kun skulle I holde fast ved det, I have, indtil jeg kommer.
 26.  Og den, som sejrer, og som indtil Enden tager Vare på mine
      Gerninger, ham vil jeg give Mag over Hedningerne;
 27.  og med en Jernstav skal han vogte dem, ligesom Lerkar
      sønderknuses, ligesom også jeg har modtaget det af min Fader;
 28.  og jeg vil give ham Morgenstjernen.
 29.  Den, som har Øre, høre, hvad Ånden siger til Menighederne!

Aabenbaringen 3

  1.  Og skriv til Menighedens Engel i Sardes: Dette siger han, som
      har de syv Guds Ånder og de syv Stjerner: Jeg kender dine
      Gerninger, at du har Ord for at leve og er dog død.
  2.  Bliv vågen og styrk det øvrige, som ellers vilde dø; thi jeg har
      ikke fundet dine Gerninger fuldkommede for min Gud.
  3.  Kom derfor i Hu, hvorledes du modtog og hørte, og bevar det og
      omvend dig! Dersom du altså ikke våger, skal jeg komme som en
      Tyv, og du skal ikke vide, i hvilken Time jeg kommer over dig.
  4.  Dog har du i Sardes nogle få Personer, som ikke have besmittet
      deres Blæder; de skulle vandre med mig i hvide Klæder, thi de
      ere værdige dertil.
  5.  Den, som sejrer, han skal således iføres hvide Klæder, og jeg
      vil ikke udslette hans Navn af Livets Bog, og jeg vil bekende
      hans Navn for min Fader og for hans Engle.
  6.  Den, som har Øre, høre, hvad Ånden siger til Menighederne!

  7.  Og skriv til Menighedens Engel i Filadelfia: Dette siger den
      hellige, den sanddru, han, som har Davids Nøgle, han, som lukker
      op, så ingen lukker i, og lukker i, så ingen lukker op:
  8.  Jeg kender dine Gerninger. Se, jeg bar givet dig, at der foran
      dig er en åbnet Dør, som ingen kan lukke; thi du har kun liden
      Kraft, og dog har du bevaret mit Ord og ikke fornægtet mit Navn.
  9.  Se, jeg lader komme nøgle af Satans Synagoge, som kalde sig selv
      Jøder og ikke ere det, men lyve. Se, jeg vil gøre, at de skulle
      komme og tilbede for dine Fødder og kende, at jeg har fattet
      Kærlighed til dig
 10.  Efterdi du har bevaret mit Ord om Udholdenheden, vil også jeg
      bevare dig ud af Fristelsens Stund, som skal komme over hele
      Jorderige for at friste dem, som bo på Jorden.
 11.  Jeg kommer snart! Hold fast ved det, du har, for at ingen skal
      tage din Krone.
 12.  Den, som sejrer, ham vil jeg gøre til en Søjle i min Guds
      Tempel, og han skal ikke mere gå ud derfra; og jeg vil skrive på
      ham min Guds Navn og min Guds Stads Navn, det nye Jerusalem, der
      kommer ned fra Himmelen fra min Gud, og mit nye Navn.
 13.  Den, som har Øre, høre, hvad Ånden siger til Menighederne!

 14.  Og skriv til Menighedens Engel i Laodikea: Dette siger han, som
      er Amen, det troværdige og sanddru Vidne, Guds Skabnings
      Begyndelse:
 15.  Jeg kender dine Gerninger, at du hverken er kold eller varm; gid
      du var kold eller varm!
 16.  Derfor, efterdi du er lunken og 'hverken varm eller kold, vil
      jeg udspy dig af min Mund;
 17.  fordi du siger: Jeg er rig og har vundet Rigdom og fattes intet;
      og du ved ikke, at du er den elendige og jammerlige og fattige
      og blinde og nøgne.
 18.  Jeg råder dig, at du af mig køber Guld, lutret i Ilden, for at
      du kan blive rig, og hvide Klæder, for at du kan klæde dig
      dermed, og din Nøgenheds Skam ikke skal blottes, og Øjensalve
      til at salve dine Øjne med, for at du kan se.
 19.  Alle dem, jeg elsker, dem revser og tugter jeg; vær derfor
      nidkær og omvend dig!
 20.  Se, jeg står før Døren og banker; dersom nøgen hører min Røst og
      åbner Døren, vil jeg gå ind til ham og holde Nadver med ham, og
      han med mig.
 21.  Den, som sejrer, ham vil jeg give at tage Sæde hos mig på min
      Trone, ligesom jeg har sejret og har taget Sæde hos min Fader på
      hans Trone.
 22.  Den, som har Øre, høre, hvad Ånden siger til Menighederne!

Aabenbaringen 4

  1.  Derefter så jeg, og se, der var en Dør åbnet i Himmelen, og den
      første Røst, hvilken jeg havde hørt som af en Basun, der talte
      med mig, sagde: Stig herop, og jeg vil vise dig, hvad der skal
      ske herefter.
  2.  Straks henryktes jeg i Ånden; og se, en Trone stod i Himmelen,
      og en sad på Tronen,
  3.  og den siddende var at se til ligesom Jaspissten og Sarder, og
      der var en Regnbue omkring Tronen, at se til ligesom Smaragd.
  4.  Og omkring Tronen var der fire og tyve Troner, og på Tronerne
      sad der fire og tyve Ældste, iførte hvide Klæder og med
      Guldkranse på deres Hoveder.
  5.  Og fra Tronen udgår der Lyn og Røster og Tordener, og syv
      Ildfakler brænde foran Tronen, hvilke ere de syv Guds Ånder.
  6.  Og foran Tronen er der som et Glarhav, ligesom Krystal, og midt
      for Tronen og rundt om Tronen fire levende Væsener, fulde af
      Øjne fortil og bagtil.

  7.  Og det første Væsen ligner en Løve; og det andet Væsen ligner en
      Okse; og det tredje Væsen har Ansigt som et Menneske; og det
      fjerde Væsen ligner en flyvende Ørn.
  8.  Og de fire Væsener have hvert især seks Vinger, rundt om og
      indadtil ere de fulde af Øjne; og uden Ophør sige de Dag og Nat:
      Hellig, hellig, hellig er Herren, Gud, den Almægtige, han, som
      var, og som er, og som kommer!
  9.  Og når Væsenerne give Ære og Pris og Tak til ham, som sidder på
      Tronen, ham, som lever i Evighedernes Evigheder,
 10.  da falde de fire og tyve Ældste ned for ham, som sidder på
      Tronen, og tilbede ham, som lever i Evighedernes Evigheder, og
      lægge deres Kranse ned for Tronen og sige:
 11.  Værdig er du, vor Herre og Gud, til at få Prisen og Æren og
      Magten; thi du har skabt alle Ting, og på Grund af din Villie
      vare de, og bleve de skabte.

Aabenbaringen 5

  1.  Og jeg så i hans højre Hånd, som sad på Tronen, en Bog,
      beskreven indeni og udenpå, forseglet med syv Segl.
  2.  Og jeg så en vældig Engel, som udråbte med høj Røst: Hvem er
      værdig til at åbne Bogen og bryde dens Segl?
  3.  Og ingen i Himmelen, ej heller på Jorden, ej heller under
      Jorden, formåede at åbne Bogen eller at se i den.
  4.  Og jeg græd såre, fordi ingen fandtes værdig til at åbne Bogen
      eller at se i den.
  5.  Og en af de Ældste sagde til mig: Græd ikke! se, sejret har
      Løven af Judas Stamme, Davids Rodskud, så han kan åbne Bogen og
      dens syv Segl.
  6.  Og jeg så, midt imellem Tronen med de fire Væsener og de Ældste
      stod et Lam, ligesom slagtet: det havde syv Horn og syv Øjne,
      hvilke ere de syv Guds Ånder, som ere udsendte til hele Jorden.
  7.  Og det kom og tog Bogen af hans højre Hånd, som sad på Tronen.

  8.  Og da det tog Bogen, faldt de fire Væsener og de fire og tyve
      Ældste ned for Lammet, holdende hver sin Harpe og Guldskåle
      fyldte med Røgelse, som er de helliges Bønner.
  9.  Og de sang en ny Sang og sagde: Du er værdig til at tage Bogen
      og åbne dens Segl, fordi du blev slagtet og med dit Blod købte
      til Gud Mennesker af alle Stammer og Tungemål og Folk og
      Folkeslag,
 10.  og du har gjort dem for vor Gud til et Kongerige og til Præster,
      og de skulle være Konger på Jorden.
 11.  Og jeg så, og jeg hørte rundt om Tronen og Væsenerne og de
      Ældste en Røst af mange Engle, og deres Tal var Titusinder Gange
      Titusinder, og Tusinder Gange Tusinder,
 12.  og de sagde med høj Røst: Værdigt er Lammet, det slagtede, til
      at få Kraften og Rigdom og Visdom og Styrke og Ære og Pris og
      Velsignelse!
 13.  Og hver Skabning, som er i Himmelen og på Jorden og under Jorden
      og på Havet, ja, alt, hvad der er i dem, hørte jeg sige: Ham,
      som sidder på Tronen, og Lammet tilhører Velsignelsen og Æren og
      Prisen og Magten i Evighedernes Evigheder!
 14.  Og de fire Væsener sagde: Amen! Og de Ældste faldt ned og
      tilbade.

Aabenbaringen 6

  1.  Og jeg så, da Lammet åbnede et af de syv Segl, og jeg hørte et
      af de fire Væsener sige som en Tordens Røst: Kom!
  2.  Og jeg så, og se en hvid Hest, og han, som sad på den, havde en
      Bue; og der blev givet ham en Krone, og han drog ud sejrende og
      til Sejer.
  3.  Og da det åbnede det andet Segl, hørte jeg det andet Væsen sige:
      Kom!
  4.  Og der udgik en anden Hest, som var rød; og ham, som sad på den,
      blev det givet at tage Freden bort fra Jorden, og at de skulde
      myrde hverandre; og der blev givet ham et stort Sværd.
  5.  Og da det åbnede det tredje Segl, hørte jeg det tredje Væsen
      sige: Kom! Og jeg så, og se en sort Hest, og han, der sad på
      den, havde en Vægt i sin Hånd.
  6.  Og jeg hørte ligesom en Røst midt iblandt de fire Væsener, som
      sagde: Et Mål Hvede for en Denar og tre Mål Byg for en Denar; og
      Olien og Vinen skal du ikke gøre Skade.
  7.  Og da det åbnede det fjerde Segl, hørte jeg en Røst af det
      fjerde Væsen sige: Kom!
  8.  Og jeg så, og se en grøngul Hest, og han, som sad på den, hans
      Navn var Døden, og Dødsriget fulgte med ham; og der blev givet
      dem Magt over Fjerdedelen af Jorden til at ihjelslå med Sværd og
      med Hunger og med Pest og ved Jordens vilde Dyr.

  9.  Og da det åbnede det femte Segl, så jeg under Alteret deres
      Sjæle, som vare myrdede for Guds Ords Skyld og for det
      Vidnesbyrds Skyld, som de havde.
 10.  Og de råbte med høj Røst og sagde: Hvor længe, Herre, du hellige
      og sanddru! undlader du at dømme og hævne vort Blod på dem, som
      bo på Jorden?
 11.  Og der blev givet dem hver især en lang, hvid Klædning, og der
      blev sagt til dem, at de skulde hvile endnu en liden Tid, indtil
      også Tallet på deres Medtjenere og deres Brødre blev fuldt,
      hvilke skulde ihjelslås ligesom de.

 12.  Og jeg så, da det åbnede det sjette Segl, da skete der et stort
      Jordskælv, og Solen blev sort som en Hårsæk, og Månen blev helt
      som Blod.
 13.  Og Himmelens Stjerner faldt ned på Jorden, ligesom et Figentræ
      nedkaster sine umodne Figen, når det rystes af et stærkt Vejr.
 14.  Og Himmelen veg bort, lig en Bog, der sammenrulles, og hvert
      Bjerg og hver Ø flyttedes fra deres Steder.
 15.  Og Kongerne på Jorden og Stormændene og Krigsøverstene og de
      rige og de vældige og hver Træl og fri skjulte sig i Hulerne og
      i Bjergenes Kløfter,
 16.  og de sagde til Bjergene og Klipperne: Falder over os og skjuler
      os for Hans Åsyn, som sidder på Tronen, og for Lammets Vrede!
 17.  Thi deres Vredes støre Dag er kommen; og hvem kan bestå?

Aabenbaringen 7

  1.  Og derefter så jeg fire Engle stå på Jordens fire Hjørner; de
      holdt ordens fire Vinde; for at ingen Vind skulde blæse over
      Jorden, ej heller over Havet, ej heller over noget Træ.
  2.  Og jeg så en anden Engel stige op fra Solens Opgang med den
      levende Guds Segl; og han råbte med høj Røst til de fire Engle,
      hvem det var givet at skade Jorden og Havet, og sagde:
  3.  Skader ikke Jorden, ej heller Havet, ej heller Træerne, førend
      vi have beseglet vor Guds Tjenere på deres Pander.
  4.  Og jeg hørte Tallet på de beseglede, hundrede og fire og
      fyrretyve Tusinde beseglede af alle Israels Børns Stammer:
  5.  af Judas Stamme tolv Tusinde beseglede, af Rubens Stamme tolv
      Tusinde, af Gads Stamme tolv Tusinde,
  6.  af Asers Stamme tolv Tusinde, af Nafthalis Stamme tolv Tusinde,
      af Manasses Stamme tolv Tusinde,
  7.  af Simeons Stamme tolv Tusinde, af Levis Stamme tolv Tusinde, af
      Issakars Stamme tolv Tusinde
  8.  af Sebulons Stamme tolv Tusinde, af Josefs Stamme tolv Tusinde
      og af Benjamins Stamme tolv Tusinde beseglede.

  9.  Derefter så jeg, og se en stor Skare, som ingen kunde tælle, af
      alle Folkeslag og Stammer og Folk og Tungemål, som stod for
      Tronen og for Lammet, iførte lange, hvide Klæder og med
      Palmegrene i deres Hænder;
 10.  og de råbte med høj Røst og sagde: Frelsen tilhører vor Gud, som
      sidder på Tronen, og Lammet!
 11.  Og alle Englene stode rundt om Tronen og om de Ældste og om de
      fire Væsener og faldt ned for Tronen på deres Ansigt og tilbade
      Gud og sagde:
 12.  Amen! Velsignelsen og Prisen og Visdommen og Taksigelsen og Æren
      og Kraften og Styrken tilhører vor Gud i Evighedernes Evigheder!
      Amen.
 13.  Og en af de Ældste tog til Orde og sagde til mig: Disse, som ere
      iførte de lange, hvide Klæder, hvem ere de? og hvorfra ere de
      komne?
 14.  Og jeg sagde til ham: Min Herre! du ved det. Og han sagde til
      mig: Det er dem, som komme ud af den store Trængsel, og de have
      tvættet deres Klæder og gjort dem hvide i Lammets Blod.
 15.  Derfor ere de foran Guds Trone og tjene ham Dag og Nat i hans
      Tempel; og han, som sidder på Tronen, skal opslå sit Telt over
      dem.
 16.  De skulle ikke hungre mere, ej heller tørste mere, ej heller
      skal Solen eller nogen Hede falde på dem.
 17.  Thi Lammet, som er midt for Tronen, skal vogte dem og lede dem
      til Livets Vandkilder; og Gud skal aftørre hver Tåre af deres
      Øjne.

Aabenbaringen 8

  1.  Og da det åbnede det syvende Segl, blev der Tavshed i Himmelen
      omtrent en halv Time.

  2.  Og jeg så de syv Engle, som stå for Guds Åsyn; og der blev givet
      dem syv Basuner.
  3.  Og en anden Engel kom og stillede sig ved Alteret med et
      Guldrøgelsekar, og der blev givet ham megen Røgelse, for at han
      skulde føje den til alle de helliges Bønner på Guldalteret foran
      Tronen.
  4.  Og Røgen af Røgelsen steg op, med de helliges Bønner, fra
      Engelens Hånd før Guds Åsyn.
  5.  Og Engelen tog Røgelsekarret og fyldte det med Ild fra Alteret
      og kastede den på Jorden; og der kom Torden og Røster og Lyn og
      Jordskælv.

  6.  Og de syv Engle, som havde de syv Basuner, gjorde sig rede til
      at basune.
  7.  Og den første basunede, og der kom Hagl og Ild, blandet med
      Blød, og blev kastet på Jorden; og Tredjedelen af Jorden blev
      opbrændt, og alt grønt Græs opbrændtes.
  8.  Og den anden 'Engel basunede, og det var, som et stort brændende
      Bjerg blev kastet i Havet; og Tredjedelen af Havet blev til
      Blod.
  9.  Og Tredjedelen af de Skabninger i Havet, som havde Liv, døde; og
      Tredjedelen af Skibene blev ødelagt.
 10.  Og den tredje Engel basunede, og fra Himmelen faldt der en stor
      Stjerne, brændende som en Fakkel, og den faldt på Tredjedelen al
      Floderne og på Vandkilderne.
 11.  Og Stjernens Navn kaldes Malurt; og Tredjedelen af Vandene blev
      til Malurt, og mange af Menneskene døde af Vandene, fordi de
      vare blevne beske.
 12.  Og den fjerde Engel basunede, og Tredjedelen af Solen og
      Tredjedelen af Månen og Tredjedelen af Stjernerne blev ramt, så
      at Tredjedelen af dem blev formørket, og Dagen mistede
      Tredjedelen af sit Lys og Natten ligeså.
 13.  Og jeg så, og jeg hørte en Ørn flyve midt oppe under Himmelen og
      sige med høj Røst: Ve, ve, ve dem, som bo på Jorden, for de
      øvrige Basunrøster fra de tre Engle, som skulle basune.

Aabenbaringen 9

  1.  Og den femte Engel basusnede, og jeg så en Stjerne, som var
      falden ned fra Himmelen på Jorden, og Nøglen til Afgrundens
      Brønd blev given den.
  2.  Og den åbnede Afgrundens Brønd, og en Røg steg op af Brønden,
      lig Røgen af en stor Ovn; og Solen og Luften blev formørket af
      Røgen fra Brønden.
  3.  Og fra Røgen udgik der Græshopper over Jorden, og der blev givet
      dem Magt, som Jordens Skorpioner have Magt.
  4.  Og der blev sagt til dem, at de ikke måtte skade Græsset på
      Jorden, ej heller noget grønt eller noget Træ, men kun de
      Mennesker, som ikke have Guds Segl på deres Pander.  5Og det
      blev dem givet ikke at dræbe dem, men at pine dem i fem Måneder;
      og Pinen, de voldte, var som Pinen af en Skorpion, når den
      stikker et Menneske.
  6.  Og i de Dage skulle Menneskene søge Døden og ikke finde den, og
      attrå at dø, og Døden flyr fra dem.
  7.  Og Græshoppeskikkelserne lignede Heste, rustede til Krig, og på
      deres Hoveder var der som Kroner, der lignede Guld, og deres
      Ansigter vare som Menneskers Ansigter,
  8.  og de havde Hår som Kvinders Hår, og deres Tænder vare som
      Løvers,
  9.  og de havde Pansere som Jernpansere; og Lyden af deres Vinger
      var som Lyd af Stridsvogne, når mange Heste fare ud til Kamp.
 10.  Og de have Haler, som ligne Skorpioners, og Brodde, og i deres
      Haler ligger deres Magt til at skade Menneskene i fem Måneder.
 11.  De have Afgrundens Engel til Konge over sig; hans Navn er på
      Hebraisk Abaddon, og på Græsk har han Navnet Apollyon.
 12.  Det første Ve er til Ende; se, der kommer endnu to Veer
      derefter.

 13.  Og den sjette Engel basunede, og jeg hørte en Røst fra de fire
      Horn på Guldalteret, som står for Guds Åsyn,
 14.  sige til den sjette Engel, der havde Basunen: Løs de fire Engle,
      som ere bundne ved den store Flod Eufrat.
 15.  Og de fire Engle bleve løste, som til den Time og Dag og Måned
      og År vare rede til at ihjelslå Tredjedelen af Menneskene.
 16.  Og Tallet på Rytterhærene var to Gange Titusinde Gange
      Titusinde; jeg hørte deres Tal.
 17.  Og således så jeg Hestene i Synet og dem, som sade derpå, hvilke
      havde ildrøde og sorteblå og svovlgule Pansere; og Hestenes
      Hoveder vare som Løvers Hoveder, og af deres Munde udgik Ild og
      Røg og Svovl.
 18.  Af disse tre Plager, af Ilden og Røgen og Svovlet, som udgik af
      deres Munde, blev Tredjedelen af Menneskene ihjelslået.'
 19.  Thi Hestenes Magt er i deres Mund og i deres Haler; thi deres
      Haler ligne Slanger, have Hoveder, og med dem gøre de Skade.
 20.  Og de øvrige Mennesker, som ikke bleve dræbte i disse Plager,
      omvendte sig ikke fra deres Hænders Gerninger, så de lode være
      at tilbede de onde Ånder og Afgudsbillederne af Guld og Sølv og
      Kobber og Sten og Træ, som hverken kunne se eller høre eller gå;
 21.  og de omvendte sig ikke fra deres Myrden eller fra deres
      Trolddom eller fra deres Utugt eller fra deres Tyveri.

Aabenbaringen 10

  1.  Og jeg så en anden vældige Engel komme ned fra Himmelen, svøbt i
      en Sky, og Regnbuen var på hans Hoved, og hans Ansigt var som
      Solen og hans Fødder som Ildsøjler,
  2.  og han havde i sin Hånd en lille åbnet Bog. Og han satte sin
      højre Fod på Havet og den venstre på Jorden.
  3.  Og han råbte med høj Røst, som en Løve brøler; og da han havde
      råbt, lode de syv Tordener deres Røster høre.
  4.  Og da de syv Tordener havde talt, vilde jeg til at skrive; og
      jeg hørte en Røst fra Himmelen, som sagde: Forsegl, hvad de syv
      Tordener talte, og nedskriv det ikke!

  5.  Og Engelen, som jeg så stå på Havet og på Jorden, opløftede sin
      højre Hånd imod Himmelen
  6.  og svor ved ham, som lever i Evighedernes Evigheder, som bar
      skabt Himmelen, og hvad deri er, og Jorden, og hvad derpå er, og
      Havet, og hvad deri er, at der ikke mere skal gives Tid;
  7.  men i de Dage, da den syvende Engels Røst lyder, når han skal
      til at basune, da er Guds skjulte Råd fuldbyrdet således, som
      han har forkyndt sine Tjenere Profeterne.

  8.  Og den Røst, som jeg havde hørt fra Himmelen, talte atter med
      mig og sagde: Gå hen, tag den lille åbnede Bog, som er i den
      Engels Hånd, der står på Havet og på Jorden.
  9.  Og jeg gik hen til Engelen og sagde til ham, at han skulde give
      mig den lille Bog. Og han sagde til mig; Tag og nedsvælg den! og
      den vil volde Smerte i din Bug, men i din Mund vil den være sød
      som Honning.
 10.  Og jeg tog den lille Bog af Engelens Hånd og nedsvælgede den; og
      den var i min Mund sød som Honning, men da jeg havde nedsvælget
      den, følte jeg Smerte i min Bug.
 11.  Og man sagde til mig: Du bør igen profetere om mange Folk og
      Folkeslag og Tungemål og Konger.

Aabenbaringen 11

  1.  Og der blev givet mig et Rør ligesom en Målestok, med de Ord:
      Stå op og mål Guds Tempel og Alteret og dem, som tilbede deri.
  2.  Men Forgården uden for Templet, lad den ude og mål den ikke, thi
      den er given til Folkeslagene; og de skulle nedtræde den hellige
      Stad i to og fyrretyve Måneder.

  3.  Og jeg vil give mine tvende Vidner, at de skulle profetere eet
      Tusinde, to Hundrede og tresindstyve Dage, klædte i Sække.
  4.  Disse ere de tvende Olietræer og de tvende Lysestager, som stå
      for Jordens Herre.
  5.  Og dersom nogen vil gøre dem Skade, udgår der Ild af deres Mund
      og fortærer deres Fjender; og dersom nogen vil gøre dem Skade,
      bør han således ihjelslås.
  6.  Disse have Magt til at lukke Himmelen, så at der ingen Regn skal
      falde i deres Profetis Dage; og de have Magt over Vandene til at
      forvandle dem til Blod og til at slå Jorden med al Slags Plage,
      så ofte de ville.
  7.  Og når de få fuldendt deres Vidnesbyrd, skal Dyret, som stiger
      op af Afgrunden, føre Krig imod dem og overvinde dem og ihjelslå
      dem.
  8.  Og deres Lig skal ligge på Gaden i den store Stad, som i åndelig
      Forstand kaldes Sodoma og Ægypten, der, hvor også deres Herre
      blev korsfæstet.
  9.  Og Mennesker af alle Folk og Stammer og Tungemål og Folkeslag
      skulle se på deres Lig i tre og en halv Dag og ikke tilstede, at
      deres Lig lægges i Grav.
 10.  Og de, som bo på Jorden, glæde sig over dem og fryde sig; og de
      sende hverandre Gaver, fordi disse to Profeter vare til Plage
      for dem, som bo på Jorden.
 11.  Og efter de tre og en halv Dags Førløb kom der Livs Ånde fra Gud
      i dem; og de støde på deres Fødder, og stor Frygt faldt på dem,
      som så dem.
 12.  Og de hørte en høj Røst fra Himmelen, som sagde til dem: Stiger
      herop! Og de stege op til Himmelen i Skyen, og deres Fjender så
      derpå.
 13.  Og i samme Stund skete der et stort Jordskælv, og Tiendedelen af
      Staden faldt, og syv Tusinde Personer bleve dræbte i
      Jordskælvet; og de andre bleve forfærdede og gave Himmelens Gud
      Ære.
 14.  Det andet Veer til Ende; se, det tredje Ve kommer snart.

 15.  Og den syvende Engel basunede, og der hørtes høje Røster i
      Himmelen, som sagde: Herredømmet over Verden er blevet vor
      Herres og hans Salvedes, og han skal være Konge i Evighedernes
      Evigheder.
 16.  Og de fire og tyve Ældste, som sidde for Guds Åsyn på deres
      Troner, faldt ned på deres Ansigter og tilbade Gud og sagde:
 17.  Vi takke dig, Herre Gud almægtige, du, som er, og som var, fordi
      du har taget din store Magt og tiltrådt dit Kongedømme,
 18.  og Folkeslagene vrededes, og din Vrede kom og Tiden til, at de
      døde skulle dømmes, og til at give Lønnen til dine Tjenere,
      Profeterne, og de hellige og dem, som frygte dit Navn, de små og
      de store, og til at ødelægge dem, som lægge Jorden øde.
 19.  Og Guds Tempel i Himmelen blev åbnet, og hans Pagts Ark kom til
      Syne i hans Tempel, og der kom Lyn og Røster og Tordener og
      Jordskælv og stærk Hagl.

Aabenbaringen 12

  1.  Og et stort Tegn blev set i Himmelen: en Kvinde, iklædt Solen og
      med Månen under sine Fødder og en Krans af tolv Stjerner på sit
      Hoved.
  2.  Og hun var frugtsommelig og skreg i Barnsnød, under Fødselsveer.
  3.  Og et andet Tegn blev set i Himmelen, og se, der var en stor,
      ildrød Drage, som havde syv Hoveder og ti Horn og på sine
      Hoveder syv Kroner.
  4.  Og dens Hale drog Tredjedelen af Himmelens Stjerner med sig og
      kastede dem på Jorden. Og Dragen stod foran Kvinden, som skulde
      føde, for at sluge hendes Barn, når hun havde født det.
  5.  Og hun fødte et Drengebarn, som skal vogte alle Folkeslagene med
      en Jernstav; og hendes Barn blev bortrykket til Gud og til hans
      Trone.
  6.  Og Kvinden flyede ud i Ørkenen,hvor hun har et Sted beredt fra
      Gud, for at man skal ernære hende der eet Tusinde, to Hundrede
      og tresindstyve Dage.

  7.  Og der blev en Kamp i Himmelen: Mikael og hans Engle gave sig
      til at kæmpe imod Dragen, og Dragen kæmpede og dens Engle.
  8.  Men de magtede det ikke, og deres Sted fandtes ikke mere i
      Himmelen.
  9.  Og den store Drage blev nedstyrtet; den gamle Slange, som kaldes
      Djævelen og Satan, som forfører den hele Verden, blev nedstyrtet
      på Jorden, og hans Engle bleve nedstyrtede med ham.
 10.  Og jeg hørte en høj Røst i Himmelen sige: Nu er Frelsen og
      Kraften og Riget blevet vor Guds, og Magten hans Salvedes; thi
      nedstyrtet er vore Brødres Anklager, som anklagede dem for vor
      Gud Dag og Nat.
 11.  Og de have overvundet ham i Kraft af Lammets Blod og i Kraft af
      deres Vidnesbyrds Ord; og de elskede ikke deres Liv, lige til
      Døden.
 12.  Derfor, fryder eder, I Himle, og I, som bo i dem! Ve Jorden og
      Havet! thi Djævelen er nedstegen til eder og har stor Vrede,
      fordi han ved, at han kun har liden Tid.

 13.  Og da Dragen så, at den var styrtet til Jorden, forfulgte den
      Kvinden, som havde født Drengebarnet.
 14.  Og den store Ørns tvende Vinger bleve givne Kvinden, for at hun
      skulde flyve til Ørkenen, til sit Sted, der hvor hun næres en
      Tid og Tider og en halv Tid, borte fra Slangen.
 15.  Og Slangen spyede Vand som en Flod ud af sin Mund efter Kvinden
      for at bortskylle hende med Floden.
 16.  Og Jorden kom Kvinden til Hjælp; og Jorden åbnede sin Mund og
      opslugte Floden, som Dragen havde udspyet af sin Mund.
 17.  Og Dragen vrededes på Kvinden og gik bort for at føre Krig imod
      de øvrige af hendes Sæd, dem, som holde Guds Bud og have Jesu
      Vidnesbyrd.

Aabenbaringen 13

 18.  Og jeg stod på Sandet ved Havet.

      (Kap.13.)


  1.  Og jeg så et Dyr stige op af Havet, som havde ti Horn og syv
      Hoveder, og på sine Horn ti Kroner, og på sine Hoveder
      Bespottelsens Navne.
  2.  Og Dyret, som jeg så, var ligt en Panter, og dets Fødder som en
      Bjørns, og dets Mund som en Løves Mund; og Dragen gav det sin
      Kraft og sin Trone og stor Magt.
  3.  Og jeg så et af dets Hoveder ligesom såret til Døden, og dets
      dødelige Sår blev lægt, og al Jorden fulgte undrende efter
      Dyret.
  4.  Og de tilbade Dragen, fordi den havde givet Dyret Magten; og de
      tilbade Dyret og sagde: Hvem er Dyret lig? hvem mægter at kæmpe
      imod det?
  5.  Og der blev givet det en Mund til at tale store Ord og
      Bespottelser, og der blev givet det Magt til at virke i to og
      fyrretyve Måneder.
  6.  Og det åbnede sin Mund til Bespottelser imod Gud, til at
      bespotte hans Navn og hans Telt, dem, som bo i Himmelen.
  7.  Og der blev givet det at føre Krig imod de hellige og at
      overvinde dem; og der blev givet det Magt over hver Stamme og
      Folk og Tungemål og Folkeslag.
  8.  Og alle, som bo på Jorden, skulle tilbede ham, enhver, hvis Navn
      ikke fra Verdens Grundlæggelse er skrevet i Lammets, det
      slagtedes, Livets Bog.
  9.  Dersom nogen har Øre, han høre!
 10.  Dersom nogen fører andre i Fængsel, han kommer selv i Fængsel;
      dersom nogen dræber med Sværd, han skal dræbes med Sværd. Her
      gælder det de helliges Udholdenhed og Tro.

 11.  Og jeg så et andet Dyr stige op af Jorden, og det havde to Horn
      ligesom et Lam og talte som en Drage.
 12.  Og det udøver hele det første Dyrs Magt for dets Åsyn og får
      Jorden og dem, som bo derpå, til at tilbede det første dyr, hvis
      dødelige Sår blev lægt.
 13.  Og det gør store Tegn, så at det endog får Ild til. at falde ned
      fra Himmelen på Jorden for Menneskenes Åsyn.
 14.  Og det forfører dem, som bo på Jorden, for de Tegns Skyld, som
      det blev givet det at gøre for Dyrets Åsyn, og siger til dem,
      som bo på Jorden, at de skulle gøre et Billede af Dyret, ham,
      som har Sværdhugget og kom til Live.
 15.  Og det fik Magt til at give Dyrets Billede Ånd, så at Dyrets
      Billede endog kunde tale og gøre, at alle de, der ikke vilde
      tilbede Dyrets Billede, skulde ihjelslås.
 16.  Og det får alle, både små og støre, både rige og fattige, både
      frie og Trælle, til at sætte sig et Mærke på deres højre Hånd
      eller på deres Pande,
 17.  for at ingen skal kunne købe eller sælge uden den, som har
      Mærket, Dyrets Navn eller dets Navns Tal.
 18.  Her gælder det Visdom! Den, som har Forstand, udregne Dyrets
      Tal; thi det er et Menneskes Tal, og dets Tal er 666.

Aabenbaringen 14

  1.  Og jeg så, og se, Lammet stod på Zions Bjerg, og med det
      hundrede og fire og fyrretyve Tusinde, som havde dets Navn og
      dets Faders Navn skrevet på deres Pander.
  2.  Og jeg hørte en Lyd fra Himmelen som en Lyd af mange Vande og
      som en Lyd af stærk Torden, og den Lyd, jeg hørte, var som at
      Harpespillere, der spillede på deres Harper.
  3.  Og de sang en ny Sang for Tronen og for de fire levende Væsener
      og de Ældste; og ingen kunde lære den Sang, uden de hundrede og
      fire og fyrretyve Tusinde, som ere løskøbte fra Jorden.
  4.  Dette er dem, som ikke have besmittet sig med Kvinder, thi de
      ere jomfruelige; dette er dem, som følge Lammet, hvor det
      går. Disse ere løskøbte fra Menneskene, en Førstegrøde før Gud
      og Lammet,
  5.  og i deres Mund er der ikke fundet Løgn; thi de ere ulastelige.

  6.  Og jeg så en anden Engel flyve midt oppe under Himmelen, som
      havde et evigt Evangelium at forkynde for dem, der bo på Jorden,
      og for alle Folkeslag og Stammer og Tungemål og Folk,
  7.  og han sagde med høj Røst: Frygter Gud og giver ham Ære, thi
      hans Doms Time er kommen, og tilbeder ham, som har gjort
      Himmelen og Jorden og Havet og Vandenes Kilder.
  8.  Og endnu en anden Engel fulgte, som sagde: Falden, falden er
      Babylon, den store, som har givet alle Folkeslagene at drikke af
      sin Utugts Harmes Vin.
  9.  Og en tredje Engel fulgte dem og sagde med høj Røst: Dersom
      nogen tilbeder Dyret og dets Billede og tager Mærke på sin Pande
      eller på sin Hånd,
 10.  så skal han drikke af Guds Harmes Vin, som er iskænket ublandet
      i hans Vredes Bæger; og han skal pines med Ild og Svovl for de
      hellige Engles og for Lammets Åsyn.
 11.  Og deres Pines Røg opstiger i Evighedernes Evigheder; og de have
      ikke Hvile Dag og Nat, de, som tilbede Dyret og dets Billede, og
      enhver, som tager dets Navns Mærke.

 12.  Her gælder det de helliges Udholdenhed, de, som bevare Guds Bud
      og Troen på Jesus.
 13.  Og jeg hørte en Røst fra Himmelen, som sagde: Skriv: Salige ere
      de døde, som dø i Herren herefter. Ja, siger Ånden, de skulle
      hvile fra deres Møje, thi deres Gerninger følge med dem.

 14.  Og jeg, så, og se en hvid Sky, og på Skyen sad der en lig en
      Menneskesøn med en Guldkrone på sit Hoved og en skarp Segl i sin
      Hånd.
 15.  Og en anden Engel gik ud fra Templet og råbte med høj Røst til
      ham, som sad på Skyen: Udsend din Segl og høst; thi Timen til at
      høste er kommen, fordi Jordens Høst er moden.
 16.  Og han, som sad på Skyen, lod sin Segl gå over Jorden, og Jorden
      blev høstet.

 17.  Og en anden Engel gik ud fra Templet i Himmelen; også han havde
      en skarp Segl.
 18.  Og fra Alteret gik en anden Engel ud, som havde Magt over Ilden;
      og han råbte med høj Røst til den, som havde den skarpe Segl, og
      sagde: Udsend din skarpe Segl og afskær Druerne af Jordens
      Vintræ; thi dets Druer ere modne.
 19.  Og Engelen lod sin Segl gå hen over Jorden og afskar Frugten på
      Jordens Vintræ og kastede den i Guds Harmes store Persekar.
 20.  Og Persekarret blev trådt uden for Staden, og der kom Blod ud af
      Persekarret op til Hestenes Bidsler, så langt som eet Tusinde og
      seks Hundrede Stadier.

Aabenbaringen 15

  1.  Og jeg så et andet Tegn i Himmelen, stort og vidunderligt: syv
      Engel som have de syv sidste Plager; thi med disse er Guds Harme
      fuldbyrdet.
  2.  Og jeg så som et Glarhav, blandet med Ild, og dem, som sejrende
      gik ud af Kampen med Dyret og dets Billede og dets Navns Tal,
      stående ved Glarhavet og holdende Guds Harper.
  3.  Og de sang Mose, Guds Tjeners, Sang, og Lammets Sang, og sagde:
      Store og vidunderlige ere dine Gerninger, Herre, Gud, du
      Almægtige!  retfærdige og sande' ere dine Veje, du Folkeslagenes
      Konge!
  4.  Hvem skulde ikke frygte dig, Herre! og prise dit Navn? Thi du
      alene er hellig; ja, alle Folkeslagene skulle komme og tilbede
      for dit Åsyn, fordi dine retfærdige Domme ere blevne åbenbarede.
  5.  Og derefter så jeg, og Vidnesbyrdets Tabernakels Tempel i
      Himmelen blev åbnet,
  6.  og de syv Engle, som havde de syv Plager, gik ud af Templet,
      iførte rent og skinnende Linklæde og omgjordede om Brystet med
      Guldbælter.
  7.  Og et af de fire levende Væsener gav de syv Engle syv Guldskåle
      fyldte med Guds Harme, han. som lever i Evighedernes Evigheder.
  8.  Og Templet fyldtes med Røg fra Guds Herlighed og fra hans Kraft;
      og ingen kunde gå ind i Templet, førend de syv Engles syv Plager
      fik Ende.

Aabenbaringen 16

  1.  Og jeg hørte en høj Røst fra Tempelet sige til de syv Engle: Går
      hen og udgyder Guds Harmes syv Skåle over Jorden!
  2.  Og den første gik hen og udgød sin Skål over Jorden, og der kom
      slemme og onde Bylder på de Mennesker, som havde Dyrets Mærke,
      og dem, som tilbade dets Billede.
  3.  Og den anden Engel udgød sin Skål i Havet, og det blev til Blod
      som af en død; og hver levende Sjæl i Havet døde.
  4.  Og den tredje Engel udgød sin Skål i Floderne og Vandkilderne,
      og de bleve til Blod.
  5.  Og jeg hørte Vandenes Engel sige: Retfærdig er du, som er, og
      som var, du hellige, fordi du har fældet denne Dom;
  6.  thi de have udøst helliges og Profeters Blod, og du har givet
      dem Blod at drikke; de ere det værd.
  7.  Og jeg hørte Alteret sige: Ja, Herre, Gud, du almægtige! sande
      og retfærdige ere dine Domme.
  8.  Og den fjerde Engel udgød sin Skål over Solen; og det blev givet
      den at brænde Menneskene med Ild.
  9.  Og Menneskene brændtes i stor Hede og bespottede Guds Navn, som
      har Magt over disse Plager; og de omvendte sig ikke til at give
      ham Ære.
 10.  Og den femte Engel udgød sin Skål over Dyrets Trone; og dets
      Rige blev formørket, og de tyggede deres Tunger af Pine.
 11.  Og de bespottede Himmelens Gud for deres Piner og for deres
      Bylder; og de omvendte sig ikke fra deres Gerninger.
 12.  Og den sjette Engel udgød sin Skål over den store Flod Eufrat;
      og dens Vand borttørredes, for at Vejen kunde beredes for
      Kongerne fra Solens Opgang.
 13.  Og jeg så, at der af Dragens Mund og af Dyrets Mund og af den
      falske Profets Mund udgik tre urene Ånder, som lignede Padder.
 14.  Thi de ere DæmonersÅnder, som gøre Tegn; og de gå ud til hele
      Jorderiges Konger for at samle dem til Krigen på Guds, den
      almægtiges, store Dag.
 15.  - Se, jeg kommer som en Tyv Salig er den, som våger og bevarer
      sine Klæder, så han ikke skal gå nøgen, og man skal se hans
      Skam. -
 16.  Og de samlede dem til det Sted,som kaldes på Hebraisk
      Harmagedon.
 17.  Og den syvende Engel udgød sin Skål i Luften; og fra Templet,
      fra Tronen udgik der en høj Røst, som sagde: Det er sket.
 18.  Og der kom Lyn og Røster og Tordener; og der blev et stort
      Jordskælv, hvis Mage ikke har været, siden der blev Mennesker
      til på Jorden, et sådant Jordskælv, så stort.
 19.  Og den store Stad blev til tre Dele, og Folkeslagenes Stæder
      faldt; og Gud kom det store Babylon i Hu for at give det Bægeret
      med sin Vredes Harmes Vin.
 20.  Og hver Ø flyede, og Bjerge bleve ikke fundne.
 21.  Og en stærk Hagl, centnertung, faldt ned fra Himmelen på
      Menneskene; og Menneskene bespottede Gud for Haglens Plage, thi
      dens Plage var meget stor.

Aabenbaringen 17

  1.  Og en af de syv Engle, som havde de syv Skåle, kom og talte med
      mig og sagde: Kom! jeg vil vise dig Dommen over den store Skøge,
      som sidder over mange Vande,
  2.  med hvem Jordens Konger have bolet, og de, som bo på Jorden, ere
      blevne drukne af hendes Utugts Vin.
  3.  Og han førte mig i Ånden ud i en Ørken; og jeg så en Kvinde
      siddende på et skarlagenfarvet Dyr, som var fuldt af
      Bespottelsens Navne; det havde syv Hoveder og ti Hor1m.
  4.  Og Kvinden var klædt i Purpur og Skarlagen og strålede af Guld
      og Ædelsten og Perler; hun havde et Guldbæger i sin Hånd, fuldt
      af Vederstyggeligheder og hendes Utugts Urenheder.
  5.  Og på hendes Pande var skrevet et Navn, en Hemmelighed: Babylon
      den store, Moderen til Jordens Skøger og Vederstyggeligheder.
  6.  Og jeg så Kvinden, drukken af de helliges Blod og af Jesu
      Vidners Blod; og jeg undrede mig i stor Forundring, da jeg så
      hende.

  7.  Og Engelen sagde til mig: Hvorfor undrede du dig? Jeg vil sige
      dig Hemmeligheden med Kvinden og med Dyret, som bærer hende, og
      som har de syv Hoveder og de ti Horn.
  8.  Dyret, som du så, har været og er ikke, og det skal stige op af
      Afgrunden og gå bort til Fortabelse; og de, som bo på Jorden,
      skulle undre sig, de, hvis Navne ikke ere skrevne i Livets Bog
      fra Verdens Grundlæggelse, når de se,at Dyret var og er ikke og
      skal komme.
  9.  Her gælder det den Forstand, som har Visdom. De syv Hoveder ere
      syv Bjerge, på hvilke Kvinden sidder,
 10.  og de ere syv Konger. De fem ere faldne, den ene er der, den
      anden er endnu ikke kommen, og når han kommer, skal han blive en
      liden Tid.
 11.  Og Dyret, som var og er ikke, er både selv en ottende og er en
      af de syv og farer bort til Fortabelse.
 12.  Og de ti Horn, som du så, ere ti Konger, som endnu ikke have
      fået Rige, men få Magt som Konger een Time sammen med Dyret.
 13.  Disse have eet Sind, og deres Kraft og Magt give de til Dyret.
 14.  Disse skulle føre Krig med Lammet, og Lammet skal sejre over dem
      - fordi det er Herrers Herre og Kongers Konge - og de: som ere
      med det, de kaldede og udvalgte og trofaste.
 15.  Og han sagde til mig: De Vande, som du så, der hvor Skøgen
      sidder, ere Folk og Skarer og Folkeslag og Tungemål.
 16.  Og de ti Horn, som du så, og Dyret, disse ville hade Skøgen og
      gøre hende øde og nøgen og æde hendes Kød og opbrænde hende med
      Ild.
 17.  Thi Gud har indgivet dem i deres Hjerte at gøre efter hans Sind
      og at handle af eet Sind og at give Dyret deres Kongemagt,indtil
      Guds Ord blive fuldbyrdede.
 18.  Og Kvinden, som du så, er den store Stad, som har Herredømme
      over Jordens Konger.

Aabenbaringen 18

  1.  Derefter så jeg en anden Engel stige ned fra Himmelen; han havde
      stor Magt, og Jorden blev oplyst af hans Herlighed.
  2.  Og han råbte med stærk Røst og sagde: Falden, falden er Babylon
      den store, og den er bleven Dæmoners Bolig og et Fængsel for
      alle Hånde urene Ånder og et Fængsel for alle Hånde urene og
      afskyede Fugle!
  3.  Thi af hendes Utugts Harmes Vin have alle Folkeslagene drukket,
      og Jordens Konger have bolet med hende, og Jordens Købmænd ere
      blevne rige af hendes Yppigheds Fylde.
  4.  Og jeg hørte en anden Røst fra Himmelen, som sagde: Går ud fra
      hende, mit Folk! for at I ikke skulle blive meddelagtige i
      hendes Synder og ikke rammes af hendes Plager.
  5.  Thi hendes Synder ere opdyngede indtil Himmelen, og Gud har
      kommet hendes Uretfærdigheder i Hu.
  6.  Betaler hende, som hun har betalt eder, og gengælder hende
      dobbelt efter hendes Gerninger; skænker hende dobbelt i det
      Bæger, som hun har iskænket.
  7.  Så meget, som hun har forherliget sig selv og levet i Yppighed,
      så meget skulle I give hende af Pine og Sørg! Fordi hun siger i
      sit Hjerte: Jeg sidder som en Dronning og er ikke Enke, og Sorg
      skal jeg ingenlunde se,
  8.  derfor skulle hendes Plager komme på een Dag: Død og Sorg og
      Hunger, og hun skal opbrændes med Ild; thi stærk er den Herre
      Gud, som har dømt hende.

  9.  Og Jordens Konger, som have bolet og levet yppigt med hende,
      skulle græde og hyle over hende, når de se Røgen af hendes
      Brand,
 10.  medens de stå langt borte af Frygt for hendes Pinsel og sige:
      Ve!  ve! du store Stad, Babylon, du stærke Stad, thi på een Time
      er din Dom kommen.
 11.  Og Jordens Købmænd græde og sørge over hende, fordi ingen mere
      køber deres Ladning:
 12.  Ladning af Guld og Sølv og Ædelsten og Perler og fint Linned og
      Purpur og Silke og Skarlagen og alle Hånde vellugtende Træ og
      alle Hånde Arbejde af Elfenben og alle Hånde Arbejde af kostbart
      Træ og af Kobber og Jern og Marmor,
 13.  og Kanelbark og Hårsalve og Røgelser og Salve og Virak og Vin og
      Olie og fint Mel og Hvede og Okser og Får og Heste og Vogne og
      Slaver, ja, Menneskesjæle.
 14.  Og den Frugt, din Sjæl lystedes ved, er vegen fra dig og alt det
      lækre og glimrende er forbi for dig, og man skal aldrig finde
      det mere.
 15.  De, som handlede dermed og ere blevne rige ved hende, skulle stå
      langt borte af Frygt for hendes Pinsel grædende og sørgende og
      sige:
 16.  Ve ve! den store Stad, som var klædt i fint Linned og Purpur og
      Skarlagen og strålede af Guld og Ædelsten og Perler; thi i een
      Time er så stor en Rigdom lagt øde.
 17.  Og alle Styrmænd og alle Skippere og Søfolk og alle, som arbejde
      på Havet, stode langt borte
 18.  og råbte, da de så Røgen af hendes Brand, og sagde: Hvor var der
      Mage til den store Stad?
 19.  Og de kastede Støv på deres Hoveder og råbte grædende og
      sørgende og sagde: Ve! ve! den store Stad, hvori alle, som havde
      Skibe på Havet, berigedes ved dens Pragt; thi i een Time er den
      bleven lagt øde.

 20.  Fryd dig over den, du Himmel, og I hellige og Apostle og
      Profeter!  fordi Gud har skaffet eder Ret over den.

 21.  Og en vældig Engel løftede en Sten som en stor Møllesten og
      kastede den i Havet og sagde: Således skal Babylon, den store
      Stad, nedstyrtes i Hast og ikke findes mere.
 22.  Og Lyd af Harpespillere og Sangere og Fløjtespillere og
      Basunblæsere skal ikke høres i dig mere; og ingen Kunstner i
      nogen Kunst skal findes i dig mere; og Lyd af Mølle skal ikke
      høres i dig mere;
 23.  og Lys af Lampe skal ikke skinne i dig mere, og Brudgoms og
      Bruds Røst skal ikke høres i dig mere, fordi dine Købmænd vare
      Jordens Stormænd, fordi alle Folkeslagene bleve forførte ved dit
      Trylleri.
 24.  Og i den blev Profeters og helliges Blod fundet og alle deres,
      som ere myrdede på Jorden.

Aabenbaringen 19

  1.  Derefter hørte jeg ligesom en høj Røst af en stor Skare i
      Himmelen, som sagde: Halleluja! Frelsen og Herligheden og
      Kraften tilhører vor Gud.
  2.  Thi sande og retfærdige ere hans Domme, at han har dømt den
      store Skøge, som fordærvede Jorden med sin Utugt, og krævet sine
      Tjeneres Blod af hendes Hånd.
  3.  Og de sagde anden Gang: Halleluja! og Røgen fra hende opstiger i
      Evighedernes Evigheder.
  4.  Og de fire og tyve Ældste og de fire levende Væsener faldt ned
      eg tilbade Gud, som sad på Tronen, og de sagde: Amen! Halleluja!
  5.  Og en Røst udgik fra Tronen og sagde: Lover vor Gud, alle hans
      Tjenere, I, som frygte ham, de små og de store!
  6.  Og jeg hørte som en Røst af en stor Skare og som en Lyd af mange
      Vande og, som en Lyd af stærke Tordener, der sagde: Halleluja!
      thi Herren, Gud, den almægtige, har tiltrådt Kongedømmet.
  7.  Lader os glæde og fryde os og give ham Æren; thi Lammets Bryllup
      er kommet, og hans Brud har gjort sig rede.
  8.  Og det blev givet hende at iføre sig skinnende, rent Linklæde;
      thi Linklædet er de helliges Retfærdshandlinger.
  9.  Og han siger til mig: Skriv: Salige ere de, som ere budne til
      Lammets Bryllups Nadver! Og han siger til mig: Disse ere de
      sande Guds Ord.
 10.  Og jeg faldt ned for hans Fødder for at tilbede ham, og han
      siger til mig: Gør det ikke! Jeg er din Medtjener eg dine
      Brødres, som have Jesu Vidnesbyrd; tilbed Gud! thi Jesu
      Vidnesbyrd er Profetiens Ånd.

 11.  Og jeg så Himmelen åben, og se en hvid Hest, og han, som sad på
      den, kaldes trofast og sanddru, og han dømmer og kæmper med
      Retfærdighed.
 12.  Men hans Øjne vare Ildslue, og på hans Hoved var der mange
      Kroner;han havde et Navn skrevet, hvilket ingen kender, uden han
      selv;
 13.  og han var iført en Kappe, dyppet i Blod, og hans Navn kaldes:
      Guds Ord.
 14.  Og Hærene i Himmelen fulgte ham på hvide Heste, iførte hvidt,
      rent Linklæde.
 15.  Og af hans Mund udgik der et skarpt Sværd, for at han dermed
      skulde slå Folkeslagene; og han skal vogte dem med en Jernstav,
      og han skal træde Guds, den almægtiges, Vredes Harmes Vinperse.
 16.  Og på Kappen, på sin Lænd har han et Navn skrevet: Kongers Konge
      og Herrers Herre.
 17.  Og jeg så en Engel stående i Solen, og han råbte med høj Røst og
      sagde til alle Fugle, som flyve midt oppe under Himmelen: Kommer
      og samler eder til Guds store Nadver
 18.  for at æde Kød af Konger og Kød af Krigsøverster og Kød af
      vældige og Kød af Heste og af dem, som sidde på dem, og Kød af
      alle, både frie og Trælle, små og store.
 19.  Og jeg så Dyret og Jordens Kongen og deres Hære samlede for at
      føre Krig imod ham, som sad på Hesten, og imod hans Hær.
 20.  Og Dyret blev grebet og med det den falske Profet, som havde
      gjort Tegnene for dets Åsyn, hvormed han havde forført dem, som
      toge Dyrets Mærke, og dem, som tilbade dets Billede; de bleve
      begge kastede levende i Ildsøen, som brænder med Svovl.
 21.  Og de andre bleve ihjelslåede med hans Sværd, som sad på Hesten,
      det, der udgik af hans Mund, og alle Fuglene bleve mættede at
      deres Kød.

Aabenbaringen 20

  1.  Og jeg så en Engel stige ned fra Himmelen, han havde Afgrundens
      Nøgle og en stor Lænke i sin Hånd.
  2.  Og han greb Dragen, den gamle Slange, som er Djævelen og Satan,
      og bandt ham for tusinde År
  3.  og kastede ham i Afgrunden og lukkede og forseglede over ham,
      for at han ikke mere skulde forføre Folkeslagene, førend de
      tusinde År vare til Ende; derefter skal han løses en lille Tid.
  4.  Og jeg så Troner, og de satte sig på dem, og Dommermagt blev
      given dem; og jeg så deres Sjæle, som vare halshuggede for Jesu
      Vidnesbyrds og for Guds Ords Skyld, og dem, som ikke havde
      tilbedt; Dyret eller dets Billede og ikke havde taget Mærket på
      deres Pande og på deres Hånd; og de bleve levende og bleve
      Konger med Kristus i tusinde År.
  5.  De øvrige af de døde bleve ikke levende, førend de tusinde År
      vare til Ende. Dette er den første Opstandelse.
  6.  Salig og hellig er den, som bar Del i den første Opstandelse;
      over disse har den anden Død ikke Magt, men de skulle være Guds
      og Kristi Præster og skulle være Konger med ham i de tusinde År.

  7.  Og når de tusinde År ere til Ende, skal Satan løses af sit
      Fængsel.
  8.  Og han skal gå ud for at forføre Folkeslagene ved Jordens fire
      Hjørner, Gog og Magog, for at samle dem til Krig; deres Tal er
      som Havets Sand.
  9.  Og de droge frem over Jordens Flade og omringede de helliges
      Lejr og den elskede Stad. Og Ild faldt ned fra Himmelen fra Gud
      og fortærede dem.
 10.  Og Djævelen, som forførte dem, blev kastet i Ild og Svovlsøen,
      hvor også Dyret og den falske Profet var; og de skulle pines Dag
      og Nat i Evighedernes Evigheder.

 11.  Og jeg så en stor, hvid Trone og ham, som sad derpå; for hans
      Åsyn flyede Jorden og Himmelen, og der blev ikke fundet Sted for
      dem.
 12.  Og jeg så de døde, de store og de små, stående for Tronen, og
      Bøger bleve åbnede; og en anden Bog blev åbnet, som er Livets
      Bog; og de døde bleve dømte efter det, som var skrevet i
      Bøgerne, efter deres Gerninger.
 13.  Og Havet afgav de døde, som vare i det; og Døden og Dødsriget
      afgave de døde, som vare i dem, og de bleve dømte, hver efter
      sine Gerninger.
 14.  Og Døden og Dødsriget bleve kastede i Ildsøen. Dette er den
      anden Død, Ildsøen.
 15.  Og dersom nogen ikke fandtes skreven i Livets Bog, blev han
      kastet i Ildsøen.

Aabenbaringen 21

  1.  Og jeg så en ny Himmel og en ny Jord; thi den forrige Himmel og
      den forrige Jord var veget bort, og Havet var ikke mere.
  2.  Og jeg så den hellige Stad, det nye Jerusalem, stige ned fra
      Himmelen fra Gud, beredt som en Brud, der er smykket før sin
      Brudgom.
  3.  Og jeg hørte en høj Røst fra Himmelen, som sagde: Se, Guds Telt
      er hos Menneskene, og han skal bo hos dem, og de skulle være
      hans Folk, og Gud selv skal være hos dem og være deres Gud.
  4.  Og han skal aftørre hver Tåre af deres Øjne, og Døden skal ikke
      være mere, ej heller Sorg, ej heller Skrig, ej heller Pine skal
      være mere; thi det forrige er veget bort.
  5.  Og han, som sad på Tronen, sagde: Se, jeg gør alle Ting nye. Og
      han siger til mig: Skriv; thi disse Ord ere troværdige og sande.
  6.  Og han sagde til mig: De ere skete. Jeg er Alfa og Omega,
      Begyndelsen og Enden. Jeg vil give den tørstige af Livets Vands
      Kilde uforskyldt.
  7.  Den, som sejrer, skal arve dette, og jeg vil være hans God, og
      han skal være min Søn.
  8.  Men de fejge og utro og vederstyggelige og Morderne og de
      utugtige og Troldkarlene og Afgudsdyrkerne og alle Løgnerne,
      deres Lod skal være i Søen, som brænder med Ild og Svovl; dette
      er den anden Død.

  9.  Og en af de syv Engle, som havde de syv Skåle, der vare fulde af
      de syv sidste Plager, kom og talte med mig og sagde: Kom, jeg
      vil vise dig Bruden, Lammets Hustru.
 10.  Og han førte mig i Ånden hen på et stort og højt Bjerg og viste
      mig den hellige Stad, Jerusalem, stigende ned fra Himmelen, fra
      Gud
 11.  med Guds Herlighed. Dens Glans var som den kostbareste Sten, som
      krystalklar Jaspissten.
 12.  Den havde en stor og høj Mur; den havde tolv Porte og over
      Portene tolv Engle og påskrevne Navne, hvilke ere Israels Børns
      tolv Stammers;
 13.  mod Øst tre Porte og mod Nord tre Porte og mod Syd tre Porte og
      mod Vest tre Porte.
 14.  Og Stadens Mur havde tolv Grundsten, og på dem Lammets tolv
      Apostles tolv Navne.
 15.  Og han, som talte med mig, havde en Målestok, et Guldrør, for at
      han skulde måle Staden og dens Porte og dens Mur.
 16.  Og Staden ligger i Firkant, og dens Længde er lige så stor som
      Bredden. Og han målte Staden med Røret: tolv Tusinde Stadier;
      dens Længde, Bredde og Højde ere lige.
 17.  Og han målte dens Mur, hundrede og fire og fyrretyve Alen, efter
      Menneskemål, hvilket er Englemål.
 18.  Og dens Murværk var Jaspis, og Staden var af rent Guld, lig det
      rene Glar.
 19.  Stadmurens Grundsten vare prydede med alle Hånde Ædelsten: den
      første Grundsten var Jaspis, den anden Safir, den tredje
      Kalkedon, den fjerde Smaragd,
 20.  den femte Sardonyks, den sjette Sarder, den syvende Krysolit,
      den ottende Beryl, den niende Topas, den tiende Krysopras, den
      ellevte Hyacint, den tolvte Ametyst.
 21.  Og de tolv Porte vare tolv Perler, hver af Portene var af een
      Perle, og Stadens Gade var rent Guld som gennemsigtigt Glar.
 22.  Og jeg så intet Tempel i den; thi dens Tempel er Herren, Gud,
      den almægtige, og Lammet.
 23.  Og Staden trænger ikke til Sol eller Måne til at skinne for den;
      thi Guds Herlighed oplyste den, og Lammet var dens Lys.
 24.  Og Folkeslagene skulle vandre i dens Lys, og Jordens Konger
      bringe deres Herlighed til den,
 25.  og dens Porte skulle ikke lukkes om Dagen; thi Nat skal ikke
      være der,
 26.  og de skulle bringe Folkeslagenes Herlighed og Ære til den.
 27.  Og intet urent skal komme ind i den, ej heller nogen, som øver
      Vederstyggelighed og Løgn; kun de, som ere skrevne i Lammets
      Livets Bog.

Aabenbaringen 22

  1.  Og han viste mig Livets Vands Flod, skinnende som Krystal,
      udvæld de fra Guds og Lammets Trone.
  2.  Midt i dens Gade og på begge Sider af Floden voksede Livets Træ,
      som bar tolv Gange Frugt og gav hver Måned sin Frugt; og Bladene
      af Træet tjente til Lægedom for Folkeslagene.
  3.  Og der skal intet bandlyst være mere; og Guds og Lammets Trone
      skal være i den, og hans Tjenere skulle tjene ham,
  4.  og de skulle se hans Ansigt, og hans Navn skal være på deres
      Pander.
  5.  Og Nat skal der ikke være mere, og de trænge ikke til Lys af
      Lampe eller Lys af Sol, fordi Gud Herren skal lyse over dem; og
      de skulle, være Konger i Evighedernes Evigheder.

  6.  Og han sagde til mig: Disse Ord ere troværdige og sande; og
      Herren, Profeternes Ånders Gud, har udsendt sin Engel for at
      vise sine Tjenere, hvad der skal ske snart.
  7.  Og se, jeg kommer snart. Salig er den, som bevarer denne Bogs
      Profetis Ord.

FIRE! FIRE! BURN STICK!


Edited by Henry Altemus





THE HISTORY OF TOM THUMB

It is said that in the days of the famed Prince Arthur, who was king of
Britain, in the year 516, there lived a great magician, called Merlin,
the most learned and skilful enchanter in the world at that time.

This great magician, who could assume any form he pleased, was
travelling in the disguise of a poor beggar, and being very much
fatigued, he stopped at the cottage of an honest ploughman to rest
himself, and asked for some refreshment.

The countryman gave him a hearty welcome, and his wife, who was a very
good-hearted, hospital woman, soon brought him some milk in a wooden
bowl, an some coarse brown bread on a platter.

Merlin was much pleased with this homely repast and the kindness of
the ploughman and his wife; but he could not help seeing that though
everything was neat and comfortable in the cottage, they seemed both
be sad and much cast down. He therefore questioned them on the cause
of their sadness, and learned they were miserable because they had no
children.

The poor woman declared, with tears in her eyes, that she should be the
happiest creature in the world if she had a son; and although he was no
bigger than her husband's thumb, she would be satisfied.

Merlin was so much amused with the idea of a boy no bigger than a man's
thumb, that he made up his mind to pay a visit to the queen of the
fairies, and ask her to grant the poor woman's wish. The droll fancy of
such a little person among the human race pleased the fairy queen
too, greatly, and she promised Merlin that the wish should be granted.
Accordingly, a short time after, the ploughman's wife had a son, who,
wonderful to relate! was not bigger than his father's thumb.

The fairy queen, wishing to see the little fellow thus born into the
world, came in at the window while the mother was sitting up in bed
admiring him. The queen kissed the child, and, giving it the name of Tom
Thumb, sent for some of the fairies, who dressed her little favorite as
she bade them.

   "An oak-leaf hat he had for his crown;
      His shirt of web by spiders spun;
   With jacket wove of thistle's down;
      His trowsers were of feathers done.

   His stockings, of apple-rind they tie
   With eyelash from his mother's eye:
   His shoes were made of mouse's skin
   Tann'd with the downy hair within."

It is remarkable that Tom never grew any larger than his father's thumb,
which was only of an ordinary size; but as he got older he became very
cunning and full of tricks. When he was old enough to play with the
boys, and had lost all his own cherry-stones, he used to creep into
the bags of his playfellows, fill his pockets, and, getting out unseen,
would again join in the game.

One day, however, as he was coming out of a bag of cherrystones, where
he had been pilfering as usual, the boy to whom it belonged chanced to
see him. "Ah, ha! my little Tommy," said the boy, "so I have caught you
stealing my cherrystones at last, and you shall be rewarded for your
thievish tricks." On saying this, he drew the string tight around his
neck, and gave the bag such a hearty shake, that poor little Tom's legs,
thighs, and body were sadly bruised. He roared out in pain, and begged
to be let out, promising never to be guilty of such bad practices again.

A short time afterwards his mother was making a batter-pudding, and Tom
being very anxious to see how it was made, climbed up to the edge of the
bowl; but unfortunately his foot slipped and he plumped over head and
ears into the batter, unseen by his mother, who stirred him into the
pudding-bag, and put him in the pot to boil.

The batter had filled Tom's mouth, and prevented him from crying; but,
on feeling the hot water, he kicked and struggled so much in the pot,
that his mother thought that the pudding was bewitched, and, instantly
pulling it out of the pot, she threw it to the door. A poor tinker, who
was passing by, lifted up the pudding, and, putting it into his budget,
he then walked off. As Tom had now got his mouth cleared of the batter,
he then began to cry aloud, which so frightened the tinker that he flung
down the pudding and ran away. The pudding being broke to pieces by the
fall, Tom crept out covered over with the batter, and with difficulty
walked home. His mother, who was very sorry to see her darling in such
a woeful state, put him into a tea-cup, and soon washed off the batter;
after which she kissed him, and laid him in bed.

Soon after the adventure of the pudding, Tom's mother went to milk her
cow in the meadow, and she took him along with her. As the wind was very
high, fearing lest he should be blown away, she tied him to a thistle
with a piece of fine thread. The cow soon saw the oak-leaf hat, and,
liking the look of it, took poor Tom and the thistle at one mouthful.
While the cow was chewing the thistle Tom was afraid of her great teeth,
which threatened to crush him in pieces, and he roared out as loud as he
could:

"Mother, mother!"

"Where are you, Tommy, my dear Tommy?" said his mother.

"Here, mother," replied he, "in the red cow's mouth."

His mother began to cry and wring her hands; but the cow, surprised
at the odd noise in her throat, opened her mouth and let Tom drop out.
Fortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to the
ground, or he would have been dreadfully hurt. She then put Tom in her
bosom and ran home with him.

Tom's father made him a whip of barley straw to drive the cattle with,
and having one day gone into the fields, he slipped a foot and rolled
into the furrow. A raven, which was flying over, picked him up and flew
with him to the top of a giant's castle that was near the seaside, and
there left him.

Tom was in a dreadful state, and did not know what to do; but he was
soon more dreadfully frightened; for old Grumbo, the giant, came up to
walk on the terrace, and seeing Tom, he took him up and swallowed him
like a pill.

The giant had no sooner swallowed Tom than he began to repent what he
had done; for Tom began to kick and jump about so much that he felt very
uncomfortable, and at last threw him up again into the sea. A large
fish swallowed Tom the moment he fell into the sea, which was soon after
caught, and bought for the table of King Arthur. When they opened the
fish in order to cook it, every on was astonished at finding such a
little boy, and Tom was quite delighted to be out again. They carried
him to the king, who made Tom his dwarf, and he soon grew a great
favorite at court: for by his tricks and gambols he not only amused the
king and queen, but also all the knights of the Round Table.

It is said that when the kind rode out on horseback he often took
Tom along with him, and if a shower came on he used to creep into his
majesty's waistcoat pocket, where he slept till the rain was over.

King Arthur one day asked Tom about his parents, wishing to know if they
were as small as he was, and whether rich or poor. Tom told the king
that his father and mother were as tall as any of the persons about
the court, but rather poor. On hearing this the king carried Tom to the
treasure, the place where he kept all his money, and told him to take
as much money as he could carry home to his parents, which made the poor
little fellow caper with joy. Tom went immediately to fetch a purse,
which was made of a water-bubble, and then returned to the treasury,
where he got a silver three-penny-piece to put into it.

Our little hero had some trouble in lifting the burden upon his back;
but he at last succeeded in getting it placed to his mind, and set
forward on his journey. However, without meeting with any accidents, and
after resting himself more than a hundred times by the way, in two days
and two nights he reached his father's house in safety.

Tom had travelled forty-eight hours with a huge silver-piece on his
back, and was almost tired to death, when his mother ran out to meet
him, and carried him into the house.

Tom's parents were both happy to see him, and the more so as he had
brought such an amazing sum of money with him; but the poor little
fellow was excessively wearied, having travelled half a mile in
forty-eight hours, with a huge silver three-penny-piece on his back.
His mother, in order to recover him, placed him in a walnut shell by the
fireside, and feasted him for three days on a hazel nut, which made him
very sick; for a whole nut used to serve him a month.

Tom was soon well again; but as there had been a fall of rain, and the
ground was very wet, he could not travel back to King Arthur's court;
therefore his mother, one day when the wind was blowing in that
direction, made a little parasol of cambric paper, and tying Tom to it,
she gave him a puff into the air with her mouth, which soon carried him
to the king's palace.

Just at the time when Tom came flying across the courtyard, the cook
happened to be passing with the king's great bowl of furmenty, which was
a dish his majesty was very fond of; but unfortunately the poor little
fellow fell plump into the middle of it, and splashed the hot furmenty
about the cook's face.

The cook, who was an ill-natured fellow, being in a terrible rage at Tom
for frightening and scalding him with the furmenty, went straight to the
king, and said that Tom had jumped into the royal furmenty, and thrown
it down out of mere mischief. The king was so enraged when he heard
this, that he ordered Tom to be seized and tried for high treason; and
there being no person who dared to plead for him, he was condemned to be
beheaded immediately.

On hearing this dreadful sentence pronounced, poor Tom fell a-trembling
with fear, but, seeing no means of escape, and observing a miller close
to him gaping with his great mouth, as country boobies do at a far, he
took a leap, and fairly jumped down his throat. This exploit was done
with such activity that not one person present saw it, and even the
miller did not know the trick which Tom had played upon him. Now, as
Tom had disappeared, the court broke up, and the miller went home to his
mill.

When Tom heard the mill at work he knew he was clear of the court, and
therefore he began to tumble and roll about, so that the poor miller
could get no rest, thinking he was bewitched; so he sent for a doctor.
When the doctor came, Tom began to dance and sing; and the doctor, being
as much frightened as the miller, sent in haste for five other doctors
and twenty learned men.

When they were debating about this extraordinary case, the miller
happened to yawn, when Tom, seizing the chance, made another jump, and
alighted safely upon his feet in the middle of the table.

The miller, who was very much provoked at being tormented by such a
little pygmy creature, fell into a terrible rage, and, laying hold of
Tom, ran to the king with him; but his majesty, being engaged with state
affairs, ordered him to be taken away and kept in custody till he sent
for him.

The cook was determined that Tom should not slip out of his hands this
time, so he put him into a mouse-trap, and left him to peep through the
wires. Tom had remained in the trap a whole week, when he was sent for
by King Arthur, who pardoned him for throwing down the furmenty,
and took him again into favor. On account of his wonderful feats of
activity, Tom was knighted by the king, and went under the name of the
renowned Sir Thomas Thumb. As Tom's clothes had suffered much in the
batter-pudding, the furmenty, and the insides of the giant, miller, and
fishes, his majesty ordered him a new suit of clothes, and to be mounted
as a knight.

   "Of Butterfly's wings his shirt was made,
      His boots of chicken's hide;
   And by a nimble fairy blade,
      Well learned in the tailoring trade,

      His clothing was supplied.--
   A needle dangled by his side;
   A dapper mouse he used to ride,
   Thus strutted Tom in stately pride!"

  It was certainly very diverting to see Tom in this dress, and
mounted on the mouse, as he rode out a-hunting with the king and
nobility, who were all ready to expire with laughter at Tom and his fine
prancing charger.

One day, as they were riding by a farmhouse, a large cat, which was
lurking about the door, made a spring, and seized both Tom and his
mouse. She then ran up a tree with them, and was beginning to devour the
mouse; but Tom boldly drew his sword, and attacked the cat so fiercely
that she let them both fall, when one of the nobles caught him in his
hat, and laid him on a bed of down, in a little ivory cabinet.

The queen of fairies came soon after to pay Tom a visit, and carried him
back to Fairy-land, where he lived several years. During his residence
there, King Arthur, and all the persons who knew Tom, had died; and as
he was desirous of being again at court, the fairy queen, after dressing
him in a suit of clothes, sent him flying through the air to the palace,
in the days of king Thunstone, the successor of Arthur. Every one
flocked round to see him, and being carried to the king, he was asked
who he was--whence he came--and where he lived? Tom answered:

   "My name is Tom Thumb,
   From the fairies I've come.
   When King Arthur shone,
   His court was my home.
   In me he delighted,
   By him I was knighted;
   Did you never hear of Sir Thomas Thumb?"

The king was so charmed with this address that he ordered a little
chair to be made, in order that Tom might sit upon his table, and also
a palace of gold, a span high, with a door an inch wide, to live in. He
also gave him a coach, drawn by six small mice.

The queen was so enraged at the honor paid to Sir Thomas that she
resolved to ruin him, and told the king that the little knight had been
saucy to her.

The king sent for Tom in great haste, but being fully aware of the
danger of royal anger, he crept into an empty snail-shell, where he lay
for a long time, until he was almost starved with hunger; but at last he
ventured to peep out, and seeing a fine large butterfly on the ground,
near his hiding-place, he approached very cautiously, and getting
himself placed astride on it, was immediately carried up into the air.
The butterfly flew with him from tree to tree and from field to field,
and at last returned to the court, where the king and nobility all
strove to catch him; but at last poor Tom fell from his seat into a
watering-pot, in which he was almost drowned.

When the queen saw him she was in a rage, and said he should be
beheaded; and he was again put into a mouse-trap until the time of his
execution.

However, a cat, observing something alive in the trap, patted it about
till the wires broke, and set Thomas at liberty.

The king received Tom again into favor, which he did not live to enjoy,
for a large spider one day attacked him; and although he drew his sword
and fought well, yet the spider's poisonous breath at last overcame him;

   "He fell dead on the ground where he stood,
   and the spider suck'd every drop of his blood."

King Thunstone and his whole court were so sorry at the loss of their
little favorite, that they went into mourning, and raised a fine white
marble monument over his grave, with the following epitaph:

   "Here lyes Tom Thumb, King Arthur's knight,
   Who died by a spider's cruel bite.
   He was well known in Arthur's court,
   Where he afforded gallant sport;
   He rode at tilt and tournament,
   And on a mouse a-hunting went.
   Alive he filled the court with mirth;
   His death to sorrow soon gave birth.
   Wipe, wipe your eyes, and shake your head,
   And cry,--Alas!  Tom Thumb is dead!"

THE CAT AND THE MOUSE

   The cat and the mouse
      Played in the malt-house:

The cat bit the mouse's tail off. "Pray, puss, give me my tail." "No,"
says the cat, "I'll not give you your tail, till you go to the cow and
fetch me some milk."

   First she leapt, and then she ran,
   Till she came to the cow, and thus began,--

"Pray, cow, give me milk, that I may give cat milk, that cat may give me
my own tail again." "No," said the cow, "I will give you no milk, till
you go to the farmer and get me some hay."

   First she leapt, and then she ran,
   Till she came to the farmer, and thus began,--

"Pray, farmer, give me hay that I may give cow hay, that cow may give me
milk, that I may give cat milk, that cat may give me my own tail again."

"No," says the farmer, "I'll give you no hay, till you go to the butcher
and fetch me some meat."

   First she leapt, and then she ran,
   Till she came to the butcher, and thus began,--

"Pray, butcher, give me meat, that I may give farmer meat, that farmer
may give me hay, that I may give cow hay, that cow may give me milk,
that I may give cat milk, that cat may give me my own tail again."

"No," says the butcher, "I'll give you no meat till you go to the baker
and fetch me some bread."

   First she leapt, and then she ran,
   Till she came to the baker, and thus began,--

"Pray, baker, give me bread, that I may give butcher bread, that butcher
may give me meat, that I may give farmer meat, that farmer may give me
hay, that I may give cow hay, that cow may give me milk, that I may give
cat milk, that cat may give me my own tail again."

   "Yes," says the baker, "I'll give you some bread,
   But if you eat my meal, I'll cut off your head."

Then the baker gave mouse bread, and mouse gave butcher bread, and
butcher gave mouse meat, and mouse gave farmer meat, and farmer gave
mouse hay, and mouse gave cow hay, and cow gave mouse milk, and mouse
gave cat milk, and cat gave mouse her own tail again!

FIRE! FIRE! BURN STICK!

And old woman was sweeping her house, and she found a little crooked
sixpence. "What," said she, "shall I do with this little sixpence? I
will go to market and buy a little pig." As she was coming home she came
to a stile; the piggy would not go over the stile.

She went a little farther, and she met a dog. So she said to the dog,
"Dog! bit pig; piggy won't go over the stile, and I shan't get home
to-night." But the dog would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a stick. So she said, "Stick!
stick! beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile, and
I shan't get home to-night." But the stick would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a fire. So she said, "Fire! fire!
burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get
over the stile, and I shan't get home to-night." But the fire would not.

She went a little farther, and she met some water. So she said, "Water!
water! quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick wont beat dog; dog
won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile, and I shan't get home
to-night." But the water would not.

She went a little farther, and she met an ox. So she said, "Ox! ox!
drink water; water won't quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick won't
beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile, and I
shan't get home to-night." But the ox would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a butcher. So she said, "Butcher!
butcher! kill ox; ox won't drink water; water won't quench fire; fire
won't burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't
get over the stile, and I shan't get home to-night." But the butcher
would not.

She went a little father, and she met a rope. So she said, "Rope! rope!
hang butcher; butcher won't kill ox; ox won't drink water; water won't
quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite
pig; piggy won't get over the stile, and I shan't get home to-night."
But the rope would not.

So she went a little farther, and she met a rat. So she said, "Rat!
rat! gnaw rope; rope won't hang butcher; butcher won't kill ox; ox won't
drink water; water won't quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick
won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile and I
shan't get home to-night." But the rat would not.

So she went a little farther, and she met a cat. So she said, "Cat! cat!
kill rat; rat won't gnaw rope; rope won't hang butcher; butcher won't
kill ox; ox won't drink water; water won't quench fire; fire won't burn
stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over
the stile, and I shan't get home to-night." But the cat said to her, "If
you will go to yonder cow and fetch me a saucer of milk, I will kill the
rat." So away went the old woman to the cow.

But the cow said to her, "If you will go to yonder haystack and fetch me
a handful of hay, I'll give you the milk." So away went the old woman to
the haystack; and she brought the hay to the cow.

As soon as the cow had eaten the hay she gave the old woman the milk,
and away she went with it in a saucer to the cat.

As soon as the cat had lapped up the milk, the cat began to kill the
rat; the rat began to gnaw the rope; the rope began to hang the butcher;
the butcher began to kill the ox; the ox began to drink the water; the
water began to quench the fire; the fire began to burn the stick; the
stick began to beat the dog; the dog began to bite the pig; the little
pig in a fright jumped over the stile; and so the old woman got home
that night.

      ham i en drøm og sagde: "Josef, Davids Søn! frygt ikke for at
      tage din Hustru Maria til dig; thi det, som er avlet i hende, er
      af den Helligånd.
 21.  Og hun skal føde en Søn, og du skal kalde hans Navn Jesus; thi

 23.  "Se, Jomfruen skal blive frugtsommelig og føde en Søn, og man
      skal kalde hans Navn Immanuel", hvilket er udlagt: Gud med os.
 24.  Men da Josef vågnede op at Søvnen, gjorde han, som Herrens Engel
      havde befalet ham, og han tog sin Hustru til sig.
 25.  Og han kendte hende ikke, førend hun havde født sin Søn, den
      førstefødte, og han kaldte hans Navn Jesus.

  1.  Men da Jesus var født i Bethlehem i Judæa, i Kong Herodes's

  2.  "Hvor er den Jødernes Konge, som er født? thi vi have set hans
      Stjerne i Østen og ere komne for at tilbede ham."
  3.  Men da Kong Herodes hørte det, blev han forfærdet, og hele
      Jerusalem med ham;
  4.  og han forsamlede alle Folkets Ypperstepræster og skriftkloge og
      adspurgte dem, hvor Kristus skulde fødes.
  5.  Og de sagde til ham: "I Bethlehem i Judæa; thi således er der
      skrevet ved Profeten:
  6.  Og du, Bethlehem i Judas Land, er ingenlunde den mindste iblandt
      Judas Fyrster; thi af dig skal der udgå en Fyrste, som skal
      vogte mit Folk Israel."
  7.  Da kaldte Herodes hemmeligt de vise og fik af dem nøje Besked om
      Tiden, da Stjernen havde ladet sig til Syne.
  8.  Og han sendte dem til Bethlehem og sagde: "Går hen og forhører
      eder nøje om Barnet; men når I have fundet det, da forkynder mig
      det, for at også jeg kan komme og tilbede det."
  9.  Men da de havde hørt Kongen, droge de bort; og se, Stjernen, som
      de havde set i Østen, gik foran dem, indtil den kom og stod oven
      over, hvor Barnet var.
 10.  Men da de så Stjernen, bleve de såre meget glade.
 11.  Og de gik ind i Huset og så Barnet med dets Moder Maria og faldt
      ned og tilbade det og oplode deres Gemmer og ofrede det Gaver,
      Guld og Røgelse og Myrra.
 12.  Og da de vare blevne advarede af Gud i en Drøm, at de ikke
      skulde vende tilbage til Herodes, droge de ad en anden Vej
      tilbage til deres Land.

 13.  Men da de vare dragne bort, se, da viser en Herrens Engel sig i
      en Drøm for Josef og siger: "Stå op, og tag Barnet og dets Moder
      med dig og fly til Ægypten og bliv der, indtil jeg siger dig
      til; thi Herodes vil søge efter Barnet for at dræbe det."
 14.  Og han stod op og tog Barnet og dets Moder med sig om Natten og
      drog bort til Ægypten.
 15.  Og han var der indtil Herodes's Død, for at det skulde opfyldes,
      som er talt af Herren ved Profeten, der siger: "Fra Ægypten
      kaldte jeg min Søn."

 16.  Da Herodes nu så, at han var bleven skuffet af de vise, blev han
      såre vred og sendte Folk hen og lod alle Drengebørn ihjelslå,
      som vare i Bethlehem og i hele dens Omegn, fra to År og
      derunder, efter den Tid, som han havde fået Besked om af de
      vise.
 17.  Da blev det opfyldt,som er talt ved Profeten Jeremias,som siger:
 18.  "En Røst blev hørt i Rama, Gråd og megen Jamren; Rakel græd over
      sine Børn og vilde ikke lade sig trøste, thi de ere ikke mere."

 19.  Men da Herodes var død, se, da viser en Herrens Engel sig i en
      Drøm for Josef i Ægypten og siger:
 20.  "Stå op, og tag Barnet og dets Moder med dig, og drag til
      Israels Land; thi de ere døde, som efterstræbte Barnets Liv."
 21.  Og han stod op og tog Barnet og dets Moder med sig og kom til
      Israels Land.
 22.  Men da han hørte, at Arkelaus var Konge over Judæa i sin Fader
      Herodes's Sted, frygtede han for at komme derhen; og han blev
      advaret af Gud i en Drøm og drog bort til Galilæas Egne.
 23.  Og han kom og tog Bolig i en By, som kaldes Nazareth, for at det
      skulde opfyldes, som er talt ved Profeterne, at han skulde
      kaldes Nazaræer.

Matt. 3

  1.  Men i de Dage fremstår Johannes Døberen og prædiker i Judæas
      Ørken og siger:
  2.  "Omvender eder, thi Himmeriges Rige er kommet nær."
  3.  Thi han er den, om hvem der er talt ved Profeten Esajas, som
      siger: "Der er en Røst af en, som råber i Ørkenen: Bereder
      Herrens Vej, gører hans Stier jævne!"
  4.  Men han, Johannes, havde sit Klædebon af Kamelhår og et
      Læderbælte om sin Lænd; og hans Føde var Græshopper og vild
      Honning.
  5.  Da drog Jerusalem ud til ham og hele Judæa og hele Omegnen om
      Jordan.
  6.  Og de bleve døbte af ham i Floden Jordan, idet de bekendte deres
      Synder.
  7.  Men da han så mange af Farisæerne og Saddukæerne komme til hans
      Dåb, sagde han til dem: "I Øgleunger! hvem har lært eder at fly
      fra den kommende Vrede?
  8.  Bærer da Frugt, som er Omvendelsen værdig,
  9.  og mener ikke at kunne sige ved eder selv: Vi have Abraham til
      Fader; thi jeg siger eder, at Gud kan opvække Abraham Børn af
      disse Sten.
 10.  Men Øksen ligger allerede ved Roden af Træerne; så bliver da
      hvert Træ, som ikke bærer god Frugt, omhugget og kastet i Ilden.
 11.  Jeg døber eder med Vand til Omvendelse, men den, som kommer
      efter mig, er stærkere end jeg, han, hvis Sko jeg ikke er værdig
      at bære; han skal døbe eder med den Helligånd og Ild.
 12.  Hans Kasteskovl er i hans Hånd, og han skal gennemrense sin Lo
      og samle sin Hvede i Laden; men Avnerne skal han opbrænde med
      uslukkelig Ild."

 13.  Da kommer Jesus fra Galilæa til Jordan til Johannes for at døbes
      af ham.
 14.  Men Johannes vilde formene ham det og sagde: "Jeg trænger til at
      døbes af dig, og du kommer til mig!"
 15.  Men Jesus svarede og sagde til ham: "Tilsted det nu; thi således
      sømmer det sig for os at fuldkomme al Retfærdighed." Da
      tilsteder han ham det.
 16.  Men da Jesus var bleven døbt, steg han straks op af Vandet, og
      se, Himlene åbnedes for ham, og han så Guds Ånd dale ned som en
      Due og komme over ham.
 17.  Og se, der kom en Røst fra Himlene, som sagde: "Denne er min
      Søn, den elskede, i hvem jeg har Velbehag."

Matt. 4

  1.  Da blev Jesus af Ånden ført op i Ørkenen for at fristes af
      Djævelen.
  2.  Og da han havde fastet fyrretyve Dage og fyrretyve Nætter, blev
      han omsider hungrig.
  3.  Og Fristeren gik til ham og sagde: "Er du Guds Søn, da sig, at
      disse Sten skulle blive Brød."
  4.  Men han svarede og sagde: "Der er skrevet: Mennesket skal ikke
      leve af Brød alene, men af hvert Ord, som udgår igennem Guds
      Mund."
  5.  Da. tager Djævelen ham med sig til den hellige Stad og stiller
      ham på Helligdommens Tinde og siger til ham:
  6.  "Er du Guds Søn, da kast dig herned; thi der er skrevet: Han
      skal give sine Engle Befaling om dig, og de skulle bære dig på
      Hænder, for at du ikke skal støde din Fod på nogen Sten."
  7.  Jesus sagde til ham: "Der er atter skrevet: Du må ikke friste
      Herren din Gud."
  8.  Atter tager Djævelen ham med sig op på et såre højt Bjerg og
      viser ham alle Verdens Riger og deres Herlighed; og han sagde
      til ham:
  9.  "Alt dette vil jeg give dig, dersom du vil falde ned og tilbede
      mig."
 10.  Da siger Jesus til ham: "Vig bort, Satan! thi der er skrevet: Du
      skal tilbede Herren din Gud og tjene ham alene."
 11.  Da forlader Djævelen ham, og se, Engle kom til ham og tjente
      ham.

 12.  Men da Jesus hørte, at Johannes var kastet i Fængsel, drog han
      bort til Galilæa.
 13.  Og han forlod Nazareth og kom og tog Bolig i Kapernaum, som
      ligger ved Søen, i Sebulons og Nafthalis Egne,
 14.  for at det skulde opfyldes, som er talt ved Profeten Esajas, som
      siger:
 15.  "Sebulons Land og Nafthalis Land langs Søen, Landet hinsides
      Jordan, Hedningernes Galilæa,
 16.  det Folk, som sad i Mørke, har set et stort Lys, og for dem, som
      sad i Dødens Land og Skygge, for dem er der opgået et Lys."

 17.  Fra den Tid begyndte Jesus at prædike og sige: "Omvender eder,
      thi Himmeriges Rige er kommet nær."

 18.  Men da han vandrede ved Galilæas Sø, så han to Brødre, Simon,
      som kaldes Peter, og Andreas, hans Broder, i Færd med at kaste
      Garn i Søen; thi de vare Fiskere.
 19.  Og han siger til dem: "Følger efter mig, så vil jeg gøre eder
      til Menneskefiskere."
 20.  Og de forlode straks Garnene og fulgte ham.
 21.  Og da han derfra gik videre, så han to andre Brødre, Jakob,
      Zebedæus's Søn, og Johannes, hans Broder, i Skibet med deres
      Fader Zebedæus, i Færd med at bøde deres Garn, og han kaldte på
      dem.
 22.  Og de forlode straks Skibet og deres Fader og fulgte ham.

 23.  Og Jesus gik omkring i hele Galilæa, idet han lærte i deres
      Synagoger og prædikede Rigets Evangelium og helbredte enhver
      Sygdom og enhver Skrøbelighed iblandt Folket.
 24.  Og hans Ry kom ud over hele Syrien; og de bragte til ham alle
      dem, som lede af mange Hånde Sygdomme og vare plagede af
      Lidelser, både besatte og månesyge og værkbrudne; og han
      helbredte dem.
 25.  Og store Skarer fulgte ham fra Galilæa og Dekapolis og Jerusalem
      og Judæa og fra Landet hinsides Jordan.

Matt. 5

  1.  Men da han så Skarerne, steg han op på Bjerget; og da han havde
      sat sig, gik hans Disciple hen til ham,
  2.  og han oplod sin Mund, lærte dem og sagde:

  3.  "Salige ere de fattige i Ånden, thi Himmeriges Rige er deres.
  4.  Salige ere de, som sørge, thi de skulle husvales.
  5.  Salige ere de sagtmodige, thi de skulle arve Jorden.
  6.  Salige ere de, som hungre og tørste efter Retfærdigheden, thi de
      skulle mættes.
  7.  Salige ere de barmhjertige, thi dem skal vises Barmhjertighed.
  8.  Salige ere de rene af Hjertet, thi de skulle se Gud.
  9.  Salige ere de, som stifte Fred, thi de skulle kaldes Guds Børn.
 10.  Salige ere de, som ere forfulgte for Retfærdigheds Skyld, thi
      Himmeriges Rige er deres.
 11.  Salige ere I, når man håner og forfølger eder og lyver eder alle
      Hånde ondt på for min Skyld.
 12.  Glæder og fryder eder, thi eders Løn skal være stor i Himlene;
      thi således have de forfulgt Profeterne, som vare før eder.

 13.  I ere Jordens Salt; men dersom Saltet mister sin Kraft, hvormed
      skal det da saltes? Det duer ikke til andet end at kastes ud og
      nedtrædes af Menneskene.
 14.  I ere Verdens Lys; en Stad, som ligger på et Bjerg, kan ikke
      skjules.
 15.  Man tænder heller ikke et Lys og sætter det under Skæppen, men
      på Lysestagen; så skinner det for alle dem, som ere i Huset.
 16.  Lader således eders Lys skinne for Menneskene, at de må se eders
      gode Gerninger og ære eders Fader, som er i Himlene.

 17.  Mener ikke, at jeg er kommen for at nedbryde Loven eller
      Profeterne;jeg er ikke kommen for at nedbryde, men for at
      fuldkomme.
 18.  Thi sandelig, siger jeg eder, indtil Himmelen og Jorden forgår,
      skal end ikke det mindste Bogstav eller en Tøddel forgå af
      Loven, indtil det er sket alt sammen.
 19.  Derfor, den, som bryder et at de mindste af disse Bud og lærer
      Menneskene således, han skal kaldes den mindste i Himmeriges
      Rige; men den, som gør dem og lærer dem, han skal kaldes stor i
      Himmeriges Rige.
 20.  Thi jeg siger eder: Uden eders Retfærdighed overgår de
      skriftkloges og Farisæernes, komme I ingenlunde ind i Himmeriges
      Rige.

 21.  I have hørt, at der er sagt til de gamle: Du må ikke slå ihjel,
      men den, som slår ihjel, skal være skyldig for Dommen.
 22.  Men jeg siger eder, at hver den, som bliver vred på sin Broder
      uden Årsag, skal være skyldig for Dommen; og den, som siger til
      sin Broder: Raka! skal være skyldig for Rådet; og den, som
      siger: Du Dåre! skal være skyldig til Helvedes Ild.
 23.  Derfor, når du ofrer din Gave på Alteret og der kommer i Hu, at
      din Broder har noget imod dig,
 24.  så lad din Gave blive der foran Alteret, og gå hen, forlig dig
      først med din Broder, og kom da og offer din Gave!
 25.  Vær velvillig mod din Modpart uden Tøven, medens du er med ham
      på Vejen, for at Modparten ikke skal overgive dig til Dommeren,
      og Dommeren til Tjeneren, og du skal kastes i Fængsel.
 26.  Sandelig, siger jeg dig, du skal ingenlunde komme ud derfra,
      førend du får betalt den sidste Hvid.
 27.  I have hørt, at der er sagt: Du må ikke bedrive Hor.
 28.  Men jeg siger eder, at hver den, som ser på en Kvinde for at
      begære hende, har allerede bedrevet Hor med hende i sit Hjerte.
 29.  Men dersom dit højre Øje forarger dig, så riv det ud, og kast
      det fra dig; thi det er bedre for dig, at eet af dine Lemmer
      fordærves, end at hele dit Legeme bliver kastet i Helvede.
 30.  Og om din højre Hånd forarger dig, så hug den af og kast den fra
      dig; thi det er bedre for dig, at eet af dine Lemmer fordærves,
      end at hele dit Legeme kommer i Helvede.

 31.  Og der er sagt: Den, som skiller sig fra sin Hustru, skal give
      hende et Skilsmissebrev.
 32.  Men jeg siger eder, at enhver, som skiller sig fra sin Hustru,
      uden for Hors Skyld, gør, at hun bedriver Hor, og den, som tager
      en fraskilt Kvinde til Ægte, bedriver Hor.

 33.  I have fremdeles hørt, at der er sagt til de gamle: Du må ikke
      gøre nogen falsk Ed, men du skal holde Herren dine Eder.
 34.  Men jeg siger eder, at I må aldeles ikke sværge, hverken ved
      Himmelen, thi den er Guds Trone,
 35.  ej heller ved Jorden, thi den er hans Fodskammel, ej heller ved
      Jerusalem, thi det er den store Konges Stad.
 36.  Du må heller ikke sværge ved dit Hoved, thi du kan ikke gøre et
      eneste Hår hvidt eller sort.
 37.  Men eders Tale skal være ja, ja, nej, nej; hvad der er ud over
      dette, er af det onde.

 38.  I have hørt, at der er sagt: Øje for Øje, og Tand for Tand.
 39.  Men jeg siger eder, at I må ikke sætte eder imod det onde; men
      dersom nogen giver dig et Slag på din højre Kind, da vend ham
      også den anden til!
 40.  Og dersom nogen vil gå i Rette med dig og tage din Kjortel, lad
      ham da også få Kappen!
 41.  Og dersom nogen tvinger dig til at gå een Mil,da gå to med ham!
 42.  Giv den, som beder dig, og vend dig ikke fra den, som vil låne
      af dig.

 43.  I have hørt, at der er sagt: Du skal elske din Næste og hade din
      Fjende.
 44.  Men jeg siger eder: Elsker eders Fjender, velsigner dem, som
      forbande eder, gører dem godt, som hade eder, og beder for dem,
      som krænke eder og forfølge eder,
 45.  for at I må vorde eders Faders Børn, han, som er i Himlene; thi
      han lader sin Sol opgå over onde og gode og lader det regne over
      retfærdige og uretfærdige.
 46.  Thi dersom I elske dem, som elske eder, hvad Løn have I da? Gøre
      ikke også Tolderne det samme?
 47.  Og dersom I hilse eders Brødre alene, hvad stort gøre I da? Gøre
      ikke også Hedningerne det samme?
 48.  Værer da I fuldkomne, ligesom eders himmelske Fader er
      fuldkommen.

Matt. 6

  1.  Vogter eder at i ikke øve eders Retfærdighed for Menneskene for
      at beskues af dem; ellers have I ikke Løn hos eders Fader, som
      er Himlene.
  2.  Derfor, når du giver Almisse, må du ikke lade blæse i Basun
      foran dig, som Hyklerne gøre i Synagogerne og på Gaderne, for at
      de kunne blive ærede af Menneskene; sandelig, siger jeg eder, de
      have allerede fået deres Løn.
  3.  Men når du giver Almisse, da lad din venstre Hånd ikke vide,
      hvad din højre gør,
  4.  for at din Almisse kan være i Løndom, og din Fader, som ser i
      Løndom, skal betale dig.

  5.  Og når I bede, skulle I ikke være som Hyklerne; thi de stå gerne
      i Synagogerne og på Gadehjørnerne og bede, for at de kunne vise
      sig for Menneskene; sandelig, siger jeg eder, de have allerede
      fået deres Løn.
  6.  Men du, når du beder, da gå ind i dit Kammer, og luk din Dør, og
      bed til din Fader, som er i Løndom, og din Fader, som ser i
      Løndom, skal betale dig.
  7.  Men når I bede, må I ikke bruge overflødige Ord som Hedningerne;
      thi de mene, at de skulle blive bønhørte for deres mange Ord.
  8.  Ligner derfor ikke dem; thi eders Fader ved, hvad I trænge til,
      førend I bede ham,
  9.  Derfor skulle I bede således: Vor Fader, du, som er i Himlene!
      Helliget vorde dit Navn;
 10.  komme dit Rige; ske din Villie, som i Himmelen således også på
      Jorden;
 11.  giv os i dag vort daglige Brød:
 12.  og forlad os vor Skyld, som også vi forlade vore Skyldnere;
 13.  og led os ikke i Fristelse; men fri os fra det onde; (thi dit er
      Riget og Magten og Æren i Evighed! Amen.)
 14.  Thi forlade I Menneskene deres Overtrædelser, vil eders
      himmelske Fader også forlade eder;
 15.  men forlade I ikke Menneskene deres Overtrædelser, vil eders
      Fader ikke heller forlade eders Overtrædelser.

 16.  Og når I faste, da ser ikke bedrøvede ud som Hyklerne; thi de
      gøre deres Ansigter ukendelige, for at de kunne vise sig for
      Menneskene som fastende; sandelig, siger jeg eder, de have
      allerede fået deres Løn.
 17.  Men du, når du faster, da salv dit Hoved, og to dit Ansigt,
 18.  for at du ikke skal vise dig for Menneskene som fastende, men
      for din Fader, som er i Løndom; og din Fader, som ser i Løndom,
      skal betale dig.

 19.  Samler eder ikke Skatte på Jorden, hvor Møl og Rust fortære, og
      hvor Tyve bryde ind og stjæle;
 20.  men samler eder Skatte i Himmelen, hvor hverken Møl eller Rust
      fortære, og hvor Tyve ikke bryde ind og stjæle.
 21.  Thi hvor din Skat er, der vil også dit Hjerte være.
 22.  Øjet er Legemets Lys; derfor, dersom dit Øje er sundt, bliver
      hele dit Legeme lyst;
 23.  men dersom dit Øje er dårligt, bliver hele dit Legeme mørkt.
      Dersom nu det Lys, der er i dig, er Mørke, hvor stort bliver da
      ikke Mørket!
 24.  Ingen kan tjene to Herrer; thi han må enten hade den ene og
      elske den anden eller holde sig til den ene og ringeagte den
      anden. I kunne ikke tjene Gud og Mammon.

 25.  Derfor siger jeg eder: Bekymrer eder ikke for eders Liv, hvad I
      skulle spise, eller hvad I skulle drikke; ikke heller for eders
      Legeme, hvad I skulle iføre eder. Er ikke Livet mere end Maden,
      og Legemet mere end Klæderne?
 26.  Ser på Himmelens Fugle; de så ikke og høste ikke og sanke ikke i
      Lader, og eders himmelske Fader føder dem; ere I ikke meget mere
      værd end de?
 27.  Og hvem af eder kan ved at bekymre sig lægge een Alen til sin
      Vækst?
 28.  Og hvorfor bekymre I eder for Klæder? Betragter Lillierne på
      Marken, hvorledes de vokse; de arbejde ikke og spinde ikke;
 29.  men jeg siger eder, at end ikke Salomon i al sin Herlighed var
      klædt som en af dem.
 30.  Klæder da Gud således det Græs på Marken, som står i dag og i
      Morgen kastes i Ovnen, skulde han da ikke meget mere klæde eder,
      I lidettroende?
 31.  Derfor må I ikke bekymre eder og sige: Hvad skulle vi spise?
      eller: Hvad skulle vi drikke? eller: Hvormed skulle vi klæde os?
 32.  - efter alt dette søge jo Hedningerne -. Thi eders himmelske
      Fader ved, at I have alle disse Ting nødig.
 33.  Men søger først Guds Rige og hans Retfærdighed, så skulle alle
      disse Ting gives eder i Tilgift.
 34.  Bekymrer eder derfor ikke for den Dag i Morgen; thi den Dag i
      Morgen skal bekymre sig for sig selv. Hver Dag har nok i sin
      Plage.

Matt. 7

  1.  Dømmer ikke,for at I ikke skulle dømmes; thi med hvad Dom I
      dømme, skulle I dømmes,
  2.  og med hvad Mål I måle, skal der tilmåles eder.
  3.  Men hvorfor ser du Skæven, som er i din Broders Øje, men Bjælken
      i dit eget Øje bliver du ikke var?
  4.  Eller hvorledes kan du sige til din Broder: Lad mig drage Skæven
      ud af dit Øje; og se, Bjælken er i dit eget Øje.
  5.  Du Hykler! drag først Bjælken ud af dit Øje, og da kan du se
      klart til at tage Skæven ud af din Broders Øje.

  6.  Giver ikke Hunde det hellige, kaster ikke heller eders Perler
      for Svin, for at de ikke skulle nedtræde dem med deres Fødder og
      vende sig og sønderrive eder.

  7.  Beder, så skal eder gives; søger, så skulle I finde; banker på,
      så skal der lukkes op for eder.
  8.  Thi hver den, som beder, han får, og den, som søger, han finder,
      og den, som banker på, for ham skal der lukkes op.
  9.  Eller hvilket Menneske er der iblandt eder, som, når hans Søn
      beder ham om Brød, vil give ham en Sten?
 10.  Eller når han beder ham om en Fisk, mon han da vil give ham en
      Slange?
 11.  Dersom da I, som ere onde, vide at give eders Børn gode Gaver,
      hvor meget mere skal eders Fader, som er i Himlene, give dem
      gode Gaver, som bede ham!

 12.  Altså, alt hvad I ville, at Menneskene skulle gøre imod eder,
      det skulle også I gøre imod dem; thi dette er Loven og
      Profeterne.

 13.  Går ind ad den snævre Port; thi den Port er vid, og den Vej er
      bred,som fører til Fortabelsen, og de ere mange, som gå ind ad
      den;
 14.  thi den Port er snæver, og den Vej er trang, som fører til Livet
      og de er få, som finde den

 15.  Men vogter eder for de falske Profeter, som komme til eder i
      Fåreklæder, men indvortes ere glubende Ulve.
 16.  Af deres Frugter skulle I kende dem. Sanker man vel Vindruer af
      Torne eller Figener af Tidsler?
 17.  Således bærer hvert godt Træ gode Frugter, men det rådne Træ
      bærer slette Frugter.
 18.  Et godt Træ kan ikke bære slette Frugter, og et råddent Træ kan
      ikke bære gode Frugter.
 19.  Hvert Træ, som ikke bærer god Frugt, omhugges og kastes i Ilden.
 20.  Altså skulle I kende dem af deres Frugter.
 21.  Ikke enhver, som siger til mig: Herre, Herre! skal komme ind i
      Himmeriges Rige, men den, der gør min Faders Villie, som er i
      Himlene.
 22.  Mange skulle sige til mig på hin Dag: Herre, Herre! have vi ikke
      profeteret ved dit Navn, og have vi ikke uddrevet onde Ånder ved
      dit Navn, og have vi ikke gjort mange kraftige Gerninger ved dit
      Navn?
 23.  Og da vil jeg bekende for dem Jeg kendte eder aldrig; viger bort
      fra mig, I, som øve Uret!

 24.  Derfor, hver den, som hører disse mine Ord og gør efter dem, ham
      vil jeg ligne ved en forstandig Mand, som byggede sit Hus på
      Klippen,
 25.  og Skylregnen faldt, og Floderne kom, og Vindene blæste og sloge
      imod dette Hus, og det faldt ikke; thi det var grundfæstet på
      Klippen.
 26.  Og hver den, som hører disse mine Ord og ikke gør efter dem,
      skal lignes ved en Dåre, som byggede sit Hus på Sandet,
 27.  og Skylregnen faldt, og Floderne kom, og Vindene blæste og
      stødte imod dette Hus, og det faldt, og dets Fald var stort."

 28.  Og det skete, da Jesus havde fuldendt disse Ord, vare Skarerne
      slagne af Forundring over hans Lære;
 29.  thi han lærte dem som en, der havde Myndighed, og ikke som deres
      skriftkloge.

Matt. 8

  1.  Men da han var gået ned ad Bjerget, fulgte store Skarer ham.
  2.  Og se, en spedalsk kom, faldt ned for ham og sagde: "Herre! om
      du vil, så kan du rense mig."
  3.  Og han udrakte Hånden, rørte ved ham og sagde: "Jeg vil; bliv
      ren!" Og straks blev han renset for sin Spedalskhed
  4.  Og Jesus siger til ham: "Se til, at du ikke siger det til nogen;
      men gå hen, fremstil dig selv for Præsten, og offer den Gave,
      som Moses har befalet, til Vidnesbyrd for dem."

  5.  Men da han gik ind i Kapernaum, trådte en Høvedsmand hen til
      ham, bad ham og sagde:
  6.  "Herre! min Dreng ligger hjemme værkbruden og, pines svarlig."
  7.  Jesus siger til ham: "Jeg vil komme og helbrede ham."
  8.  Og Høvedsmanden svarede og sagde: "Herre! jeg er ikke værdig
      til, at du skal gå ind under mit Tag; men sig det blot med et
      Ord, så bliver min Dreng helbredt.
  9.  Jeg er jo selv et Menneske, som står under Øvrighed og har
      Stridsmænd under mig; og siger jeg til den ene: Gå! så går han;
      og til den anden: Kom! så kommer han; og til min Tjener: Gør
      dette! så gør han det."
 10.  Men da Jesus hørte det, forundrede han sig og sagde til dem, som
      fulgte ham: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, end ikke i Israel har jeg
      fundet så stor en Tro.
 11.  Men jeg siger eder, at mange skulle komme fra Øster og Vester og
      sidde til Bords med Abraham og Isak og Jakob i Himmeriges Rige.
 12.  Men Rigets Børn skulle kastes ud i Mørket udenfor; der skal der
      være Gråd og Tænders Gnidsel."
 13.  Og Jesus sagde til Høvedsmanden:"Gå bort,dig ske, som du
      troede!"  Og Drengen blev helbredt i den samme Time.

 14.  Og Jesus kom ind i Peters Hus og så, at hans Svigermoder lå og
      havde Feber.
 15.  Og han rørte ved hendes Hånd, og Feberen forlod hende, og hun
      stod op og vartede ham op.
 16.  Men da det var blevet Aften, førte de mange besatte til ham, og
      han uddrev Ånderne med et Ord og helbredte alle de syge;
 17.  for at det skulde opfyldes, som er talt ved Profeten Esajas, der
      siger: "Han tog vore Skrøbeligheder og bar vore Sygdomme."

 18.  Men da Jesus så store Skarer omkring sig, befalede han at fare
      over til hin Side.
 19.  Og der kom een, en skriftklog, og sagde til ham: "Mester! jeg
      vil følge dig, hvor du end går hen."
 20.  Og Jesus siger til ham: "Ræve have Huler, og Himmelens Fugle
      Reder; men Menneskesønnen har ikke det, hvortil han kan hælde
      sit Hoved."
 21.  Men en anden af disciplene sagde til ham: "Herre! tilsted mig
      først at gå hen og begrave min Fader."
 22.  Men Jesus siger til ham: "Følg mig, og lad de døde begrave deres
      døde!"

 23.  Og da han gik om Bord i Skibet, fulgte hans Disciple ham.
 24.  Og se, det blev en stærk Storm på Søen, så at Skibet skjultes af
      Bølgerne; men han sov.
 25.  Og de gik hen til ham, vækkede ham og sagde: "Herre, frels os!
      vi forgå."
 26.  Og han siger til dem: "Hvorfor ere I bange, I lidettroende?" Da
      stod han op og truede Vindene og Søen,og det blev ganske
      blikstille.
 27.  Men Menneskene forundrede sig og sagde: "Hvem er dog denne,
      siden både Vindene og Søen ere ham lydige?"

 28.  Og da han kom over til hin Side til Gadarenernes Land, mødte ham
      to besatte, som kom ud fra Gravene, og de vare såre vilde, så at
      ingen kunde komme forbi ad den Vej.
 29.  Og se, de råbte og sagde: "Hvad have vi med dig at gøre, du Guds
      Søn? Er du kommen hid før Tiden for at pine os?"
 30.  Men der var langt fra dem en stor Hjord Svin, som græssede.
 31.  Og de onde Ånder bade ham og sagde: "Dersom du uddriver os, da
      send os i Svinehjorden!"
 32.  Og han sagde til dem: "Går!" Men de fore ud og fore i Svinene;
      og se, hele Hjorden styrtede sig ned over Brinken ud i Søen og
      døde i Vandet.
 33.  Men Hyrderne flyede og gik hen i Byen og fortalte det alt
      sammen, og hvorledes det var gået til med de besatte.
 34.  Og se, hele Byen gik ud for at møde Jesus; og da de så ham, bade
      de ham om; at han vilde gå bort fra deres Egn.

Matt. 9

  1.  Og han gik om Bord i et Skib og for over og kom til sin egen By.
  2.  Og se, de bare til ham en værkbruden, som lå på en Seng; og da
      Jesus så deres Tro, sagde han til den værkbrudne: "Søn! vær
      frimodig, dine Synder forlades dig."
  3.  Og se, nogle af de skriftkloge sagde ved sig selv: "Denne taler
      bespotteligt."
  4.  Og da Jesus så deres Tanker, sagde han: "Hvorfor tænke I ondt i
      eders Hjerter?
  5.  Thi hvilket er lettest at sige: Dine Synder forlades dig, eller
      at sige: Stå op og gå?
  6.  Men for at I skulle vide, at Menneskesønnen har Magt på Jorden
      til at forlade Synder," da siger han til den værkbrudne: "Stå
      op, og tag din Seng, og gå til dit Hus!"
  7.  Og han stod op og gik bort til sit Hus.
  8.  Men da Skarerne så det, frygtede de og priste Gud, som havde
      givet Menneskene en sådan Magt.

  9.  Og da Jesus gik videre derfra, så han en Mand, som hed Matthæus,
      sidde ved Toldboden; og han siger til ham: "Følg mig!" Og han
      stod op og fulgte ham.
 10.  Og det skete, da han sad til Bords i Huset, se, da kom der mange
      Toldere og Syndere og sade til Bords med Jesus og hans Disciple.
 11.  Og da Farisæerne så det, sagde de til hans Disciple: "Hvorfor
      spiser eders Mester med Toldere og Syndere?"
 12.  Men da Jesus hørte det, sagde han: "De raske trænge ikke til
      Læge, men de syge.
 13.  Men går hen og lærer, hvad det vil sige: Jeg har Lyst til
      Barmhjertighed og ikke til Offer; thi jeg er ikke kommen for at
      kalde retfærdige, men Syndere,"

 14.  Da komme Johannes's Disciple til ham og sige: "Hvorfor faste vi
      og Farisæerne meget, men dine Disciple faste ikke?"
 15.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "Kunne Brudesvendene sørge, så længe
      Brudgommen er hos dem? Men der skal komme Dage, da Brudgommen
      bliver tagen fra dem, og da skulle de faste.
 16.  Men ingen sætter en Lap af uvalket Klæde på et gammelt Klædebon;
      thi Lappen river Klædebonnet itu, og der bliver et værre Hul.
 17.  Man kommer heller ikke ung Vin på gamle Læderflasker, ellers
      sprænges Læderflaskerne, og Vinen spildes, og Læderflaskerne
      ødelægges; men man kommer ung Vin på nye Læderflasker, så blive
      begge Dele bevarede."

 18.  Medens han talte dette til dem, se, da kom der en Forstander og
      faldt ned for ham og sagde: "Min Datter er lige nu død; men kom
      og læg din Hånd på hende, så bliver hun levende."
 19.  Og Jesus stod op og fulgte ham med sine Disciple.
 20.  Og se, en Kvinde, som havde haft Blodflod i tolv År, trådte hen
      bagfra og rørte ved Fligen af hans Klædebon;
 21.  thi hun sagde ved sig selv: "Dersom jeg blot rører ved hans
      Klædebon, bliver jeg frelst."
 22.  Men Jesus vendte sig om, og da han så hende, sagde han: "Datter!
      vær frimodig, din Tro har frelst dig." Og Kvinden blev frelst
      fra den samme Time.
 23.  Og da Jesus kom til Forstanderens Hus og så Fløjtespillerne og
      Hoben, som larmede, sagde han:
 24.  "Gå bort, thi Pigen er ikke død, men hun sover." Og de lo ad
      ham.
 25.  Men da Hoben var dreven ud, gik han ind og tog hende ved Hånden;
      og Pigen stod op.
 26.  Og Rygtet herom kom ud i hele den Egn.

 27.  Og da Jesus gik bort derfra, fulgte der ham to blinde, som råbte
      og sagde: "Forbarm dig over os, du Davids Søn!"
 28.  Men da han kom ind i Huset, gik de blinde til ham; og Jesus
      siger til dem: "Tro I, at jeg kan gøre dette?"De siger til
      ham:"Ja,Herre!"
 29.  Da rørte han ved deres Øjne og sagde: "Det ske eder efter eders
      Tro!"
 30.  Og deres Øjne bleve åbnede. Og Jesus bød dem strengt og sagde:
      "Ser til, lad ingen få det at vide."
 31.  Men de gik ud og udbredte Rygtet om ham i hele den Egn.
 32.  Men da disse gik ud, se, da førte de til ham et stumt Menneske,
      som var besat.
 33.  Og da den onde Ånd var uddreven, talte den stumme. Og Skarerne
      forundrede sig og sagde: "Aldrig er sådant set i Israel."
 34.  Men Farisæerne sagde: "Ved de onde Ånders Fyrste uddriver han de
      onde Ånder."

 35.  Og Jesus gik omkring i alle Byerne og Landsbyerne, lærte i deres
      Synagoger og prædikede Rigets Evangelium og helbredte enhver
      Sygdom og enhver Skrøbelighed.
 36.  Men da han så Skarerne, ynkedes han inderligt over dem; thi de
      vare vanrøgtede og forkomne som Får, der ikke have Hyrde.
 37.  Da siger han til sine Disciple: "Høsten er stor, men Arbejderne
      ere få;
 38.  beder derfor Høstens Herre om, at han vil sende Arbejdere ud til
      sin Høst."

Matt. 10

  1.  Og han kaldte sine tolv Disciple til sig og gav dem Magt over
      urene Ånder, til at uddrive dem og at helbrede enhver Sygdom og
      enhver Skrøbelighed.
  2.  Og disse ere de tolv Apostles Navne: Først Simon, som kaldes
      Peter, og Andreas, hans Broder, og Jakob, Zebedæus's Søn, og
      Johannes, hans Broder,
  3.  Filip og Bartholomæus, Thomas og Tolderen Matthæus, Jakob,
      Alfæus's Søn, og Lebbæus med Tilnavn Thaddæus,
  4.  Simon Kananæeren og Judas Iskariot, han, som forrådte ham.

  5.  Disse tolv udsendte Jesus, bød dem og sagde: "Går ikke hen på
      Hedningers Vej, og går ikke ind i Samaritaners By!
  6.  Men går hellere hen til de fortabte Får af Israels Hus!
  7.  Men på eders Vandring skulle I prædike og sige: Himmeriges Rige
      er kommet nær.
  8.  Helbreder syge, opvækker døde, renser spedalske, uddriver onde
      Ånder! I have modtaget det for intet, giver det for intet!
  9.  Skaffer eder ikke Guld, ej heller Sølv, ej heller Kobber i eders
      Bælter;
 10.  ej Taske til at rejse med, ej heller to Kjortler, ej heller Sko,
      ej heller Stav; thi Arbejderen er sin Føde værd.
 11.  Men hvor I komme ind i en By eller Landsby, der skulle I spørge,
      hvem i den der er det værd, og der skulle I blive, indtil I
      drage bort.
 12.  Men når I gå ind i Huset, da hilser det;
 13.  og dersom Huset er det værd, da komme eders Fred over det; men
      dersom det ikke er det værd, da vende eders Fred tilbage til
      eder!
 14.  Og dersom nogen ikke modtager eder og ej hører eders Ord, da går
      ud af det Hus eller den By og ryster Støvet af eders Fødder!
 15.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, det skal gå Sodomas og Gomorras Land
      tåleligere på Dommens Dag end den By.

 16.  Se, jeg sender eder som Får midt iblandt Ulve; vorder derfor
      snilde som Slanger og enfoldige som Duer!
 17.  Vogter eder for Menneskene; thi de skulle overgive eder til
      Rådsforsamlinger og hudstryge eder i deres Synagoger.
 18.  Og I skulle føres for Landshøvdinger og Konger for min Skyld,
      dem og Hedningerne til et Vidnesbyrd.
 19.  Men når de overgive eder, da bekymrer eder ikke for, hvorledes
      eller hvad I skulle tale; thi det skal gives eder i den samme
      Time, hvad I skulle tale.
 20.  Thi I ere ikke de, som tale; men det er eders Faders Ånd, som
      taler i eder.
 21.  Men Broder skal overgive Broder til Døden, og Fader sit Barn, og
      Børn skulle sætte sig op imod Forældre og slå dem ihjel.
 22.  Og I skulle hades af alle for mit Navns Skyld; men den, som
      holder ud indtil Enden, han skal blive frelst.
 23.  Men når de forfølge eder i een By, da flyr til en anden; thi
      sandelig, siger jeg eder, I skulle ikke komme til Ende med
      Israels Byer, førend Menneskesønnen kommer.
 24.  En Discipel er ikke over sin Mester, ej heller en Tjener over
      sin Herre.
 25.  Det er Disciplen nok, at han bliver som sin Mester, og Tjeneren
      som sin Herre. Have de kaldt Husbonden Beelzebul, hvor meget
      mere da hans Husfolk?

 26.  Frygter altså ikke for dem; thi intet er skjult, som jo skal
      åbenbares, og intet er lønligt, som jo skal blive kendt.
 27.  Taler i Lyset, hvad jeg siger eder i Mørket; og prædiker på
      Tagene, hvad der siges eder i Øret!
 28.  Og frygter ikke for dem, som slå Legemet ihjel, men ikke kunne
      slå Sjælen ihjel; men frygter hellere for ham, som kan fordærve
      både Sjæl og Legeme i Helvede.
 29.  Sælges ikke to Spurve for en Penning? Og ikke een af dem falder
      til Jorden uden eders Faders Villie.
 30.  Men på eder ere endog alle Hovedhår talte.
 31.  Frygter derfor ikke; I ere mere værd end mange Spurve.
 32.  Altså, enhver som vedkender sig mig for Menneskene, ham vil også
      jeg vedkende mig for min Fader, som er i Himlene.
 33.  Men den, som fornægter mig for Menneskene, ham vil også jeg
      fornægte for min Fader, som er i Himlene.

 34.  Mener ikke, at jeg er kommen for at bringe Fred på Jorden; jeg
      er ikke kommen for at bringe Fred, men Sværd.
 35.  Thi jeg er kommen før at volde Splid imellem en Mand og hans
      Fader og imellem en Datter og hendes Moder og imellem en
      Svigerdatter og hendes Svigermoder,
 36.  og en Mands Husfolk skulle være hans Fjender.
 37.  Den, som elsker Fader eller Moder mere end mig, er mig ikke
      værd; og den, som elsker Søn eller Datter mere end mig, er mig
      ikke værd;
 38.  og den, som ikke tager sit Kors og følger efter mig, er mig ikke
      værd.
 39.  Den, som bjærger sit Liv, skal miste det; og den, som mister sit
      Liv for min Skyld, skal bjærge det.

 40.  Den, som modtager eder, modtager mig; og den, som modtager mig,
      modtager ham, som udsendte mig.
 41.  Den, som modtager en Profet, fordi han er en Profet, skal få en
      Profets Løn; og den, som modtager en retfærdig, fordi han er en
      retfærdig, skal få en retfærdigs Løn.
 42.  Og den, som giver en af disse små ikkun et Bæger koldt Vand at
      drikke, fordi han er en Discipel, sandelig, siger jeg eder, han
      skal ingenlunde miste sin Løn."

Matt. 11

  1.  Og det skete, da Jesus var færdig med at give sine tolv Disciple
      Befaling, gik han videre derfra for at lære og prædike i deres
      Byer.
  2.  Men da Johannes hørte i Fængselet om Kristi Gerninger, sendte
      han Bud med sine Disciple og lod ham sige:
  3.  "Er du den, som kommer, eller skulle vi vente en anden?"
  4.  Og Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Går hen, og forkynder
      Johannes de Ting, som I høre og se:
  5.  blinde se, og lamme gå, spedalske renses, og døve høre, og døde
      stå op, og Evangeliet forkyndes for fattige;
  6.  og salig er den, som ikke forarges på mig."
  7.  Men da disse gik bort, begyndte Jesus at sige til Skarerne om
      Johannes: "Hvad gik I ud i Ørkenen at skue? Et Rør, som bevæges
      hid og did af Vinden?
  8.  Eller hvad gik I ud at se? Et Menneske, iført bløde Klæder? Se,
      de, som bære bløde Klæder, ere i Kongernes Huse.
  9.  Eller hvad gik I ud at se? En Profet? Ja, siger jeg eder, endog
      mere end en Profet.
 10.  Thi han er den, om hvem der er skrevet: Se,jeg sender min Engel
      for dit Ansigt, han skal berede din Vej foran dig.
 11.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, iblandt dem, som ere fødte af Kvinder,
      er ingen større fremstået end Johannes Døberen; men den mindste
      i Himmeriges Rige er større end han.
 12.  Men fra Johannes Døberens Dage indtil nu tages Himmeriges Rige
      med Vold, og Voldsmænd rive det til sig.
 13.  Thi alle Profeterne og Loven have profeteret indtil Johannes.
 14.  Og dersom I ville tage imod det: Han er Elias, som skal komme.
 15.  Den, som har Øren at høre med, han høre!

 16.  Men hvem skal jeg ligne denne Slægt ved? Den ligner Børn, som
      sidde på Torvene og råbe til de andre og sige:
 17.  Vi blæste på Fløjte for eder, og I dansede ikke; vi sang
      Klagesange, og I jamrede ikke.
 18.  Thi Johannes kom, som hverken spiste eller drak, og de sige: Han
      er besat.
 19.  Menneskesønnen kom, som spiser og drikker, og de sige: Se, en
      Frådser og en Vindranker, Tolderes og Synderes Ven! Dog,
      Visdommen er retfærdiggjort ved sine Børn."

 20.  Da begyndte han at skamme de Byer ud, i hvilke hans fleste
      kraftige Gerninger vare gjorte, fordi de ikke havde omvendt sig:
 21.  "Ve dig, Korazin! ve dig, Bethsajda! thi dersom de kraftige
      Gerninger, som ere skete i eder, vare skete i Tyrus og Sidon, da
      havde de for længe siden omvendt sig i Sæk og Aske.
 22.  Men jeg siger eder: Det skal gå Tyrus og Sidon tåleligere på
      Dommens Dag end eder.
 23.  Og du, Kapernaum! som er bleven ophøjet indtil Himmelen, du skal
      nedstødes indtil Dødsriget; thi dersom de kraftige Gerninger,
      som ere skete i dig, vare skete i Sodoma, da var den bleven
      stående indtil denne Dag.
 24.  Men jeg siger eder: Det skal gå Sodomas Land tåleligere på
      Dommens Dag end dig."

 25.  På den Tid udbrød Jesus og sagde: "Jeg priser dig, Fader,
      Himmelens og Jordens Herre! fordi du har skjult dette for vise
      og forstandige og åbenbaret det for umyndige.
 26.  Ja, Fader! thi således skete det, som var velbehageligt for dig.
 27.  Alle Ting ere mig overgivne af min Fader; og ingen kender Sønnen
      uden Faderen, og ingen kender Faderen uden Sønnen, og den, for
      hvem Sønnen vil åbenbare ham.

 28.  Kommer hid til mig alle, som lide Møje og ere besværede, og jeg
      vil give eder Hvile.
 29.  Tager mit Åg på eder, og lærer af mig; thi jeg er sagtmodig og
      ydmyg af Hjertet; så skulle I finde Hvile for eders Sjæle. 30
      Thi mit Åg er gavnligt, og min Byrde er let."

Matt. 12

  1.  På den Tid vandrede Jesus på Sabbaten igennem en Sædemark; men
      hans Disciple bleve hungrige og begyndte at plukke Aks og at
      spise.
  2.  Men da Farisæerne så det, sagde de til ham: "Se, dine Disciple
      gøre, hvad det ikke er tilladt at gøre på en Sabbat."
  3.  Men han sagde til dem: "Have I ikke læst, hvad David gjorde, da
      han blev hungrig og de, som vare med ham?
  4.  hvorledes han gik ind i Guds Hus og spiste Skuebrødene, som det
      ikke var ham tilladt at spise, ej heller dem, som vare med ham,
      men alene Præsterne?
  5.  Eller have I ikke læst i Loven, at på Sabbaterne vanhellige
      Præsterne Sabbaten i Helligdommen og ere dog uden Skyld?
  6.  Men jeg siger eder, at her er det, som er større end
      Helligdommen.
  7.  Men dersom I havde vidst, hvad det Ord betyder: Jeg har Lyst til
      Barmhjertighed og ikke til Offer, da havde I ikke fordømt dem,
      som ere uden Skyld.
  8.  Thi Menneskesønnen er Herre over Sabbaten."

  9.  Og han gik videre derfra og kom ind i deres Synagoge.
 10.  Og se, der var en Mand, som havde en vissen Hånd; og de spurgte
      ham ad og sagde: "Er det tilladt at helbrede på Sabbaten?" for
      at de kunde anklage ham.
 11.  Men han sagde til dem: "Hvilket Menneske er der iblandt eder,
      som har kun eet Får, og ikke tager fat på det og drager det op,
      dersom det på Sabbaten falder i en Grav?
 12.  Hvor meget er nu ikke et Menneske mere end et Får? Altså er det
      tilladt at gøre vel på Sabbaten."
 13.  Da siger han til Manden: "Ræk din Hånd ud!" og han rakte den ud,
      og den blev igen sund som den anden.
 14.  Men Farisæerne gik ud og lagde Råd op imod ham, hvorledes de
      kunde slå ham ihjel.

 15.  Men da Jesus mærkede det, drog han bort derfra; og mange fulgte
      ham, og han helbredte dem alle.
 16.  Og han bød dem strengt, at de ikke måtte gøre ham kendt;
 17.  for at det skulde opfyldes, som er talt ved Profeten Esajas, som
      siger:
 18.  "Se, min Tjener, som jeg har udvalgt, min elskede, i hvem min
      Sjæl har Velbehag; jeg vil give min Ånd over ham, og han skal
      forkynde Hedningerne Ret.
 19.  Han skal ikke kives og ikke råbe, og ingen skal høre hans Røst
      på Gaderne.
 20.  Han skal ikke sønderbryde det knækkede Rør og ikke udslukke den
      rygende Tande, indtil han får ført Retten frem til Sejr.
 21.  Og på hans Navn skulle Hedninger håbe."

 22.  Da blev en besat, som var blind og stum, ført til ham; og han
      helbredte ham, så at den stumme talte og så.
 23.  Og alle Skarerne forfærdedes og sagde: "Mon denne skulde være
      Davids Søn?"
 24.  Men da Farisæerne hørte det, sagde de: "Denne uddriver ikke de
      onde Ånder uden ved Beelzebul, de onde Ånders Fyrste."
 25.  Men såsom han kendte deres Tanker, sagde han til dem: "Hvert
      Rige, som er kommet i Splid med sig selv, lægges øde; og hver By
      eller Hus, som er kommet i Splid med sig selv, kan ikke bestå.
 26.  Og hvis Satan uddriver Satan, så er han kommen i Splid med sig
      selv; hvorledes skal da hans Rige bestå?
 27.  Og dersom jeg uddriver de onde Ånder ved Beelzebul, ved hvem
      uddrive da eders Sønner dem? Derfor skulle de være eders
      Dommere.
 28.  Men dersom jeg uddriver de onde Ånder ved Guds Ånd, da er jo
      Guds Rige kommet til eder.
 29.  Eller hvorledes kan nogen gå ind i den stærkes Hus og røve hans
      Ejendele, uden han først binder den stærke? Da kan han plyndre
      hans Hus.
 30.  Den, som ikke er med mig, er imod mig; og den, som ikke samler
      med mig, adspreder.

 31.  Derfor siger jeg eder: Al Synd og Bespottelse skal forlades
      Menneskene, men Bespottelsen imod Ånden skal ikke forlades.
 32.  Og den, som taler et Ord imod Menneskesønnen, ham skal det
      forlades; men den som taler imod den Helligånd, ham skal det
      ikke forlades, hverken i denne Verden eller i den kommende.
 33.  Lader enten Træet være godt og dets Frugt god; eller lader Træet
      være råddent, og dets Frugt rådden; thi Træet kendes på Frugten.
 34.  I Øgleunger! hvorledes kunne I tale godt, når I ere onde? Thi af
      Hjertets Overflødighed taler Munden.
 35.  Et godt Menneske fremtager gode Ting af sit gode Forråd; og et
      ondt Menneske fremtager onde Ting af sit onde Forråd.
 36.  Men jeg siger eder, at Menneskene skulle gøre Regnskab på
      Dommens Dag for hvert utilbørligt Ord, som de tale.
 37.  Thi af dine Ord skal du retfærdiggøres, og af dine Ord skal du
      førdømmes."

 38.  Da svarede nogle af de skriftkloge og Farisæerne ham og sagde:
      "Mester! vi ønske at se et Tegn at dig."
 39.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "En ond og utro Slægt
      forlanger Tegn, men der skal intet Tegn gives den uden Profeten
      Jonas's Tegn.
 40.  Thi ligesom Jonas var tre Dage og tre Nætter i Havdyrets Bug,
      således skal Menneskesønnen være tre Dage og tre Nætter i
      Jordens Skød.
 41.  Mænd fra Ninive skulle opstå ved Dommen sammen med denne Slægt
      og fordømme den; thi de omvendte sig ved Jonas's Prædiken; og
      se, her er mere end Jonas.
 42.  Sydens Dronning skal oprejses ved Dommen sammen med denne Slægt
      og fordømme den; thi hun kom fra Jordens Grænser for at høre
      Salomons Visdom; og se, her er mere end Salomon.

 43.  Men når den urene Ånd er faren ud af Mennesket, vandrer den
      igennem vandløse Steder, søger Hvile og finder den ikke.
 44.  Da siger den: Jeg vil vende om til mit Hus, som jeg gik ud af;
      og når den kommer, finder den det ledigt, fejet og prydet.
 45.  Så går den hen og tager syv andre Ånder med sig, som ere værre
      end den selv, og når de ere komne derind, bo de der; og det
      sidste bliver værre med dette Menneske end det første. Således
      skal det også gå denne onde Slægt."

 46.  Medens han endnu talte til Skarerne, se, da stode hans Moder og
      hans Brødre udenfor og begærede at tale med ham.
 47.  Da sagde en til ham: "Se, din Moder og dine Brødre stå udenfor
      og begære at tale med dig."
 48.  Men han svarede og sagde til den, som sagde ham det: "Hvem er
      min Moder? og hvem ere mine Brødre?"
 49.  Og han rakte sin Hånd ud over sine Disciple og sagde: "Se, her
      er min Moder og mine Brødre!
 50.  Thi enhver, der gør min Faders Villie, som er i Himlene, han er
      min Broder og Søster og Moder."

Matt. 13

  1.  På hin dag gik Jesus ud af Huset og satte sig ved Søen.
  2.  Og store Skarer samlede sig om ham, så han gik om Bord i et Skib
      og satte sig; og hele Skaren stod på Strandbredden.
  3.  Og han talte meget til dem i Lignelser og sagde: "Se, en
      Sædemand gik ud at så.
  4.  Og idet han såede, faldt noget ved Vejen; og Fuglene kom og åde
      det op.
  5.  Og noget faldt på Stengrund, hvor det ikke havde megen Jord; og
      det voksede straks op, fordi det ikke havde dyb Jord.
  6.  Men da Solen kom op, blev det svedet af, og fordi det ikke havde
      Rod, visnede det.
  7.  Og noget faldt iblandt Torne; og Tornene voksede op og kvalte
      det.
  8.  Og noget faldt i god Jord og bar Frugt, noget hundrede, noget
      tresindstyve, noget tredive Fold.
  9.  Den, som har Øren, han høre!"

 10.  Og Disciplene gik hen og sagde til ham: "Hvorfor taler du til
      dem i Lignelser?"
 11.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Fordi det er eder givet at
      kende Himmeriges Riges Hemmeligheder; men dem er det ikke givet.
 12.  Thi den, som har, ham skal der gives, og han skal få Overflod;
      men den, som ikke har, fra ham skal endog det tages, som han
      har.
 13.  Derfor taler jeg til dem i Lignelser, fordi de skønt seende dog
      ikke se, og hørende dog ikke høre og forstå ikke heller.
 14.  Og på dem opfyldes Esajas's Profeti, som siger: Med eders Øren
      skulle I høre og dog ikke forstå og se med eders Øjne og dog
      ikke se.
 15.  Thi dette Folks Hjerte er blevet sløvet, og med Ørene høre de
      tungt, og deres Øjne have de tillukket, for at de ikke skulle se
      med Øjnene og høre med Ørene og forstå med Hjertet og omvende
      sig, på jeg kunde helbrede dem.
 16.  Men salige ere eders Øjne, fordi de se, og eders Øren, fordi de
      høre.
 17.  Thi sandelig, siger jeg eder, mange Profeter og retfærdige
      attråede at se, hvad I se, og så det ikke; og at høre, hvad I
      høre, og hørte det ikke.

 18.  Så hører nu I Lignelsen om Sædemanden!
 19.  Når nogen hører Rigets Ord og ikke forstår det, da kommer den
      Onde og river det bort, som er sået i hans Hjerte; denne er det,
      som blev sået ved Vejen.
 20.  Men det, som blev sået på Stengrund, er den, som hører Ordet og
      straks modtager det med Glæde.
 21.  Men han har ikke Rod i sig og holder kun ud til en Tid; men når
      der kommer Trængsel eller Forfølgelse for Ordets Skyld, forarges
      han straks.
 22.  Men det, som blev sået iblandt Torne, er den, som hører Ordet,
      og Verdens Bekymring og Rigdommens Forførelse kvæler Ordet, og
      det bliver uden Frugt.
 23.  Men det, som blev sået i god Jord, er den, som hører Ordet og
      forstår det, og som så bærer Frugt, en hundrede, en
      tresindstyve, en tredive Fold."

 24.  En anden Lignelse fremsatte han for dem og sagde: "Himmeriges
      Rige lignes ved et Menneske, som såede god Sæd i sin Mark.
 25.  Men medens Folkene sov, kom hans Fjende og såede Ugræs iblandt
      Hveden og gik bort.
 26.  Men da Sæden spirede frem og bar Frugt, da kom også Ugræsset til
      Syne.
 27.  Og Husbondens Tjenere kom til ham og sagde: Herre, såede du ikke
      god Sæd i din Mark? Hvor har den da fået Ugræsset fra?
 28.  Men han sagde til dem: Det har et fjendsk Menneske gjort. Da
      sige Tjenerne til ham: Vil du da, at vi skulle gå hen og sanke
      det sammen?
 29.  Men han siger: Nej, for at I ikke, når I sanke Ugræsset sammen,
      skulle rykke Hveden op tillige med det.
 30.  Lader dem begge vokse tilsammen indtil Høsten; og i Høstens Tid
      vil jeg sige til Høstfolkene: Sanker først Ugræsset sammen og
      binder det i Knipper for at brænde det, men samler Hveden i min
      Lade!"

 31.  En anden Lignelse fremsatte han for dem og sagde: "Himmeriges
      Rige ligner et Sennepskorn, som en Mand tog og såede i sin Mark.
 32.  Dette er vel mindre end alt andet Frø; men når det er vokset op,
      er det støre end Urterne og bliver et Træ, så at Himmelens Fugle
      komme og bygge Rede i dets Grene."

 33.  En anden Lignelse talte han til dem: "Himmeriges Rige ligner en
      Surdejg, som en Kvinde tog og lagde ned i tre Mål Mel, indtil
      det blev syret alt sammen."

 34.  Alt dette talte Jesus til Skarerne i Lignelser, og uden Lignelse
      talte han intet til dem,
 35.  for at det skulde opfyldes, som er talt ved Profeten, der siger:
      "Jeg vil oplade min Mund i Lignelser; jeg vil udsige det, som
      har været skjult fra Verdens Grundlæggelse."

 36.  Da forlod han Skarerne og gik ind i Huset; og hans Disciple kom
      til ham og sagde: "Forklar os Lignelsen om Ugræsset på Marken!"
 37.  Men han svarede og sagde: "Den, som sår den gode Sæd, er
      Menneskesønnen,
 38.  og Marken er Verden, og den gode Sæd er Rigets Børn, men
      Ugræsset er den Ondes Børn,
 39.  og Fjenden, som såede det, er Djævelen; og Høsten er Verdens
      Ende; og Høstfolkene ere Engle.
 40.  Ligesom nu Ugræsset sankes sammen og opbrændes med Ild, således
      skal det ske ved Verdens Ende.
 41.  Menneskesønnen skal udsende sine Engle, og de skulle sanke ud af
      hans Rige alle Forargelserne og dem, som gøre Uret;
 42.  og de skulle kaste dem i Ildovnen; der skal være Gråd og Tænders
      Gnidsel.
 43.  Da skulle de retfærdige skinne som Solen i deres Faders
      Rige. Den.  som har Øren, han høre!

 44.  Himmeriges Rige ligner en Skat. som er skjult i en Mark, og en
      Mand fandt og skjulte den, og af Glæde over den går han hen og
      sælger alt, hvad han har, og køber den Mark.

 45.  Atter ligner Himmeriges Rige en Købmand, som søgte efter skønne
      Perler;
 46.  og da han fandt een meget kostbar Perle, gik han hen og solgte
      alt, hvad han havde, og købte den.

 47.  Atter ligner Himmeriges Rige et Vod, som blev kastet i Havet og
      samlede Fisk af alle Slags.
 48.  Og da det var blevet fuldt, drog man det op på Strandbredden og
      satte sig og sankede de gode sammen i Kar, men kastede de rådne
      ud.
 49.  Således skal det gå til ved Verdens Ende. Englene skulle gå ud
      og skille de onde fra de retfærdige
 50.  og kaste dem i Ildovnen; der skal være Gråd og Tænders Gnidsel.
 51.  Have I forstået alt dette?" De sige til ham: "Ja."
 52.  Men han sagde til dem: "Derfor er hver skriftklog, som er oplært
      for Himmeriges Rige, ligesom en Husbond, der tager nyt og
      gammelt frem af sit Forråd."

 53.  Og det skete, da Jesus havde fuldendt disse Lignelser, drog han
      bort derfra.
 54.  Og han kom til sin Fædrene by og lærte dem i deres Synagoge, så
      at de bleve slagne af Forundring og sagde: "Hvorfra har han
      denne Visdom og de kraftige Gerninger?
 55.  Er denne ikke Tømmermandens Søn? Hedder ikke hans Moder Maria og
      hans Brødre Jakob og Josef og Simon og Judas?
 56.  Og hans Søstre, ere de ikke alle hos os? Hvorfra har han alt
      dette?"
 57.  Og de forargedes på ham. Men Jesus sagde til dem: "En Profet er
      ikke foragtet uden i sit eget Fædreland og i sit Hus,"
 58.  Og han gjorde ikke mange kraftige Gerninger der for deres
      Vantros Skyld.

Matt. 14

  1.  På den Tid hørte Fjerdingsfyrsten Herodes Rygtet om Jesus.
  2.  Og han sagde til sine Tjenere: "Det er Johannes Døberen; han er
      oprejst fra de døde, derfor virke Kræfterne i ham."
  3.  Thi Herodes havde grebet Johannes og bundet ham og sat ham i
      Fængsel for sin Broder Filips Hustru, Herodias's Skyld.
  4.  Johannes sagde nemlig til ham: "Det er dig ikke tilladt at have
      hende."
  5.  Og han vilde gerne slå ham ihjel, men frygtede for Mængden, thi
      de holdt ham for en Profet.
  6.  Men da Herodes's Fødselsdag kom, dansede Herodias's Datter for
      dem; og hun behagede Herodes.
  7.  Derfor lovede han med en Ed at give hende, hvad som helst hun
      begærede.
  8.  Og tilskyndet af sin Moder siger hun: "Giv mig Johannes Døberens
      Hoved hid på et Fad!"
  9.  Og Kongen blev bedrøvet; men for sine Eders og for Gæsternes
      Skyld befalede han, at det skulde gives hende.
 10.  Og han sendte Bud og lod Johannes halshugge i Fængselet.
 11.  Og hans Hoved blev bragt på et Fad og givet Pigen, og hun bragte
      det til sin Moder.
 12.  Da kom hans Disciple og toge Liget og begravede ham, og de kom
      og forkyndte Jesus det.

 13.  Og da Jesus hørte det, drog han bort derfra i et Skib til et øde
      Sted afsides; og da Skarerne hørte det, fulgte de ham til Fods
      fra Byerne.
 14.  Og da han kom i Land, så han en stor Skare, og han ynkedes
      inderligt over dem og helbredte deres syge.
 15.  Men da det blev Aften, kom Disciplene til ham og sagde: "Stedet
      er øde, og Tiden er allerede forløben; lad Skarerne gå bort, for
      at de kunne gå hen i Landsbyerne og købe sig Mad."
 16.  Men Jesus sagde til dem: "De have ikke nødig at gå bort; giver I
      dem at spise!"
 17.  Men de sige til ham: "Vi have ikke her uden fem Brød og to
      Fisk."
 18.  Men han sagde: "Henter mig dem hid!"
 19.  Og han bød Skarerne at sætte sig ned i Græsset og tog de fem
      Brød og de to Fisk, så op til Himmelen og velsignede; og han
      brød Brødene og gav Disciplene dem, og Disciplene gave dem til
      Skarerne.
 20.  Og de spiste alle og bleve mætte; og de opsamlede det, som blev
      tilovers af Stykkerne, tolv Kurve fulde
 21.  Men de, som spiste, vare omtrent fem Tusinde Mænd, foruden
      Kvinder og Børn.

 22.  Og straks nødte han sine Disciple til at gå om Bord i Skibet og
      i Forvejen sætte over til hin Side, medens han lod Skarerne gå
      bort.
 23.  Og da han havde ladet Skarerne gå bort, gik han op på Bjerget
      afsides for at bede. Og da det blev silde, var han der alene.
 24.  Men Skibet var allerede midt på Søen og led Nød af Bølgerne; thi
      Vinden var imod.
 25.  Men i den fjerde Nattevagt kom han til dem, vandrende på Søen.
 26.  Og da Disciplene så ham vandre på Søen, bleve de forfærdede og
      sagde: "Det er et Spøgelse;" og de skrege af Frygt.
 27.  Men straks talte Jesus til dem og sagde: "Værer frimodige; det
      er mig, frygter ikke!"
 28.  Men Peter svarede ham og sagde: "Herre! dersom det er dig, da
      byd mig at komme til dig på Vandet!"
 29.  Men han sagde: "Kom!" Og Peter trådte ned fra Skibet og vandrede
      på Vandet for at komme til Jesus.
 30.  Men da han så det stærke Vejr, blev han bange; og da han
      begyndte at synke, råbte han og sagde: "Herre, frels mig!"
 31.  Og straks udrakte Jesus Hånden og greb ham, og han siger til
      ham: "Du lidettroende, hvorfor tvivlede du?"
 32.  Og da de stege op i Skibet, lagde Vinden sig.
 33.  Men de, som vare i Skibet, faldt ned for ham og sagde: "Du er
      sandelig Guds Søn."
 34.  Og da de vare farne over, landede de i Genezareth.

 35.  Og da Folkene på det Sted kendte ham, sendte de Bud til hele
      Egnen der omkring og bragte alle de syge til ham.
 36.  Og de bade ham, at de blot måtte røre ved Fligen af hans
      Klædebon; og alle de, som rørte derved, bleve helbredede.

Matt. 15

  1.  Da kommer der fra Jerusalem Farisæere og skriftkloge til Jesus
      og sige:
  2.  "Hvorfor overtræde dine Disciple de gamles Overlevering? thi de
      to ikke deres Hænder, når de holde Måltid."
  3.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Hvorfor overtræde også I Guds
      Bud for eders Overleverings Skyld?
  4.  Thi Gud har påbudt og sagt: "Ær din Fader og Moder;" og: "Den,
      som hader Fader eller Moder, skal visselig dø."
  5.  Men I sige: "Den, som siger til sin Fader eller sin Moder: "Det,
      hvormed du skulde være hjulpet af mig, skal være en Tempelgave,"
      han skal ingenlunde ære sin Fader eller sin Moder."
  6.  Og I have ophævet Guds Lov for eders Overleverings Skyld.
  7.  I Hyklere! Rettelig profeterede Esajas om eder, da han sagde:
  8.  "Dette Folk ærer mig med Læberne; men deres Hjerte er langt
      borte fra mig.
  9.  Men de dyrke mig forgæves,idet de lære Lærdomme, som ere
      Menneskers Bud."
 10.  Og han kaldte Folkeskaren til sig og sagde til dem: "Hører og
      forstår!
 11.  Ikke det, som går ind i Munden, gør Mennesket urent, men det,
      som går ud af Munden, dette gør Mennesket urent."
 12.  Da kom hans Disciple hen og sagde til ham: "Ved du, at
      Farisæerne bleve forargede, da de hørte den Tale?"
 13.  Men han svarede og sagde: "Enhver Plantning, som min himmelske
      Fader ikke har plantet, skal oprykkes med Rode.
 14.  Lader dem fare, det er blinde Vejledere for blinde; men når en
      blind leder en blind, falde de begge i Graven."
 15.  Men Peter svarede og sagde til ham: "Forklar os Lignelsen!"
 16.  Og han sagde: "Ere også I endnu så uforstandige?
 17.  Forstår I endnu ikke, at alt, hvad der går ind i Munden, går i
      Bugen og føres ud ad den naturlige Vej?
 18.  Men det, som går ud af Munden, kommer ud fra Hjertet, og det gør
      Mennesket urent.
 19.  Thi ud fra Hjertet kommer der onde Tanker, Mord, Hor, Utugt,
      Tyverier, falske Vidnesbyrd, Forhånelser.
 20.  Det er disse Ting, som gøre Mennesket urent; men at spise med
      utoede Hænder gør ikke Mennesket urent."

 21.  Og Jesus gik bort derfra og drog til Tyrus's og Sidons Egne.
 22.  Og se, en kananæisk Kvinde kom fra disse Egne, råbte og sagde:
      "Herre, Davids Søn! forbarm dig over mig! min Datter plages ilde
      af en ond Ånd."
 23.  Men han svarede hende ikke et Ord. Da trådte hans Disciple til,
      bade ham og sagde: "Skil dig af med hende, thi hun råber efter
      os."
 24.  Men han svarede og sagde: "Jeg er ikke udsendt uden til de
      fortabte Får af Israels Hus."
 25.  Men hun kom og kastede sig ned for ham og sagde: "Herre, hjælp
      mig!"
 26.  Men han svarede og sagde: "Det er ikke smukt at tage Børnenes
      Brød og kaste det for de små Hunde."
 27.  Men hun sagde: "Jo, Herre! de små Hunde æde jo dog også af de
      Smuler, som falde fra deres Herrers Bord."
 28.  Da svarede Jesus og sagde til hende: "O Kvinde, din Tro er stor,
      dig ske, som du vil!" Og hendes Datter blev helbredt fra samme
      Time.

 29.  Og Jesus gik bort derfra og kom hen til Galilæas Sø, og han gik
      op på Bjerget og satte sig der.
 30.  Og store Skarer kom til ham og havde lamme, blinde, stumme,
      Krøblinge og mange andre med sig; og de lagde dem for hans
      Fødder, og han helbredte dem,
 31.  så at Skaren undrede sig, da de så, at stumme talte, Krøblinge
      bleve raske, lamme gik, og blinde så; og de priste Israels Gud.

 32.  Men Jesus kaldte sine Disciple til sig og sagde: "Jeg ynke s
      inderligt over Skaren; thi de have allerede tøvet hos mig tre
      Dage og have intet at spise; og lade dem gå fastende bort, vil
      jeg ikke, for at de ikke skulle vansmægte på Vejen."
 33.  Og hans Disciple sige til ham: "Hvorfra skulle vi få så mange
      Brød i en Ørken, at vi kunne mætte så mange Mennesker?"
 34.  Og Jesus siger til dem: "Hvor mange Brød have I?" Men de sagde:
      "Syv og nogle få Småfisk."
 35.  Og han bød Skaren at sætte sig ned på Jorden
 36.  og tog de syv Brød og Fiskene, takkede, brød dem og gav
      Disciplene dem, og Disciplene gave dem til Skarerne.
 37.  Og de spiste alle og bleve mætte; og de opsamlede det, som blev
      tilovers af Stykkerne, syv Kurve fulde.
 38.  Men de, som spiste, vare fire Tusinde Mænd, foruden Kvinder og
      Børn.
 39.  Og da han havde ladet Skarerne gå bort, gik han om Bord i Skibet
      og kom til Magadans Egne.

Matt. 16

  1.  Og Farisæerne og Saddukæerne kom hen og fristede ham og
      begærede, at han vilde vise dem et Tegn fra Himmelen.
  2.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Om Aftenen sige I: Det bliver
      en skøn Dag, thi Himmelen er rød;
  3.  og om Morgenen: Det bliver Storm i Dag, thi Himmelen er rød og
      mørk.  Om Himmelens Udseende vide I at dømme, men om Tidernes
      Tegn kunne I det, ikke.
  4.  En ond og utro Slægt forlanger Tegn; men der skal intet Tegn
      gives den uden Jonas's Tegn." Og han forlod dem og gik bort.

  5.  Og da hans Disciple kom over til hin Side, havde de glemt at
      tage Brød med.
  6.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "Ser til, og tager eder i Vare for
      Farisæernes og Saddukæernes Surdejg!"
  7.  Men de tænkte ved sig selv og sagde: "Det er, fordi vi ikke toge
      Brød med."
  8.  Men da Jesus mærkede dette, sagde han: "I lidettroende! hvorfor
      tænke I ved eder selv på, at I ikke have taget Brød med?
  9.  Forstå I ikke endnu? Komme I heller ikke i Hu de fem Brød til de
      fem Tusinde, og hvor mange Kurve I da toge op?
 10.  Ikke heller de syv Brød til de fire Tusinde, og hvor mange Kurve
      I da toge op?
 11.  Hvorledes forstå I da ikke, at det ej var om Brød, jeg sagde det
      til eder? Men tager eder i Vare for Farisæernes og Saddukæernes
      Surdejg."
 12.  Da forstode de, at han havde ikke sagt, at de skulde tage sig i
      Vare for Surdejgen i Brød, men for Farisæernes og Saddukæernes
      Lære.

 13.  Men da Jesus var kommen til Egnen ved Kæsarea Filippi, spurgte
      han sine Disciple og sagde: "Hvem sige Folk, at Menneskesønnen
      er?"
 14.  Men de sagde: "Nogle sige Johannes Døberen; andre Elias; andre
      Jeremias eller en af Profeterne."
 15.  Han siger til dem: "Men I, hvem sige I, at jeg er?"
 16.  Da svarede Simon Peter og sagde: "Du er Kristus, den levende
      Guds Søn."
 17.  Og Jesus svarede og sagde til ham: "Salig er du, Simon Jonas's
      Søn!  thi Kød og Blod har ikke åbenbaret dig det, men min Fader,
      som er i Himlene.
 18.  Så siger jeg også dig, at du er Petrus, og på denne Klippe vil
      jeg bygge min Menighed, og Dødsrigets Porte skulle ikke få
      Overhånd over den.
 19.  Og jeg vil give dig Himmeriges Riges Nøgler, og hvad du binder
      på Jorden, det skal være bundet i Himlene, og hvad du løser på
      Jorden, det skal være løst i Himlene."
 20.  Da bød han sine Disciple, at de måtte ikke sige til nogen at han
      var Kristus.

 21.  Fra den Tid begyndte Jesus at give sine Disciple til Kende, at
      han skulde gå til Jerusalem og lide meget af de Ældste og
      Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge og ihjelslås og oprejses på
      den tredje Dag.
 22.  Og Peter tog ham til Side, begyndte at sætte ham i Rette og
      sagde: "Gud bevare dig, Herre; dette skal ingenlunde ske dig!"
 23.  Men han vendte sig og sagde til Peter: "Vig bag mig, Satan! du
      er mig en Forargelse; thi du sanser ikke, hvad Guds er, men hvad
      Menneskers er."

 24.  Da sagde Jesus til sine Disciple: "Vil nogen komme efter mig,
      han fornægte sig selv og tage sit Kors op og følge mig!
 25.  Thi den, som vil frelse sit.Liv, skal miste det; men den, som
      mister sit Liv for min Skyld, skal bjærge det.
 26.  Thi hvad gavner det et Menneske, om han vinder den hele Verden,
      men må bøde med sin Sjæl? Eller hvad kan et Menneske give til
      Vederlag for sin Sjæl?
 27.  Thi Menneskesønnen skal komme i sin Faders Herlighed med sine
      Engle; og da skal han betale enhver efter hans Gerning.
 28.  Sandelig siger jeg eder, der er nogle af dem, som stå her, der
      ingenlunde skulle smage Døden, førend de se Menneskesønnen komme
      i sit Rige."

Matt. 17

  1.  Og seks Dage derefter tager Jesus Peter og Jakob og hans Broder
      Johannes med sig og fører dem afsides op på et højt Bjerg.
  2.  Og han blev forvandlet for deres Øjne, og hans Åsyn skinnede som
      Solen, men hans Klæder bleve hvide som Lyset.
  3.  Og se, Moses og Elias viste sig for dem og samtalede med ham.
  4.  Da tog Peter til Orde og sagde til Jesus: "Herre! det er godt,
      at vi ere her; vil du, da lader os gøre tre Hytter her, dig en
      og Moses en og Elias en."
  5.  Medens han endnu talte, se, da overskyggede en lysende Sky dem;
      og se, der kom fra Skyen en Røst. som sagde: "Denne er min
      Søn. den elskede, i hvem jeg har Velbehag; hører ham!"
  6.  Og da Disciplene hørte det, faldt de på deres Ansigt og frygtede
      såre.
  7.  Og Jesus trådte hen og rørte ved dem og sagde: "Står op, og
      frygter ikke!"
  8.  Men da de opløftede deres Øjne, så de ingen uden Jesus alene.
  9.  Og da de gik ned fra Bjerget, bød Jesus dem og sagde: "Taler
      ikke til nogen om dette Syn, førend Menneskesønnen er oprejst
      fra de døde."

 10.  Og hans Disciple spurgte ham og sagde: "Hvad er det da, de
      skriftkloge sige, at Elias bør først komme?"
 11.  Og han svarede og sagde: "Vel kommer Elias og skal genoprette
      alting.
 12.  Men jeg siger eder, at Elias er allerede kommen, og de erkendte
      ham ikke, men gjorde med ham alt, hvad de vilde; således skal
      også Menneskesønnen lide ondt af dem."
 13.  Da forstode Disciplene, at han havde talt til dem om Johannes
      Døberen.

 14.  Og da de kom til Folkeskaren, kom en Mand til ham og faldt på
      Knæ for ham og sagde:
 15.  "Herre! forbarm dig over min Søn, thi han er månesyg og lidende;
      thi han falder ofte i Ild og ofte i Vand;
 16.  og jeg bragte ham til dine Disciple, og de kunde ikke helbrede
      ham."
 17.  Og Jesus svarede og sagde: "O du vantro og forvendte Slægt! hvor
      længe skal jeg være hos eder, hvor længe skal jeg tåle eder?
      Bringer mig ham hid!"
 18.  Og Jesus talte ham hårdt til, og den onde Ånd for ud af ham, og
      Drengen blev helbredt fra samme Time.
 19.  Da gik Disciplene til Jesus afsides og sagde: "Hvorfor kunde vi
      ikke uddrive den?"
 20.  Og han siger til dem: "For eders Vantros Skyld; thi sandelig,
      siger jeg eder, dersom I have Tro som et Sennepskorn, da kunne I
      sige til dette Bjerg: Flyt dig herfra derhen, så skal det flytte
      sig, og intet skal være eder umuligt.
 21.  Men denne Slags farer ikke ud uden ved Bøn og Faste."

 22.  Og medens de vandrede sammen i Galilæa, sagde Jesus til dem:
      "Menneskesønnen skal overgives i Menneskers Hænder;
 23.  og de skulle slå ham ihjel, og på den tredje Dag skal han
      oprejses." Og de bleve såre bedrøvede.

 24.  Men da de kom til Kapernaum, kom de, som opkrævede
      Tempelskatten, til Peter og sagde: "Betaler eders Mester ikke
      Skatten?"
 25.  Han sagde: "Jo." Og da han kom ind i Huset, kom Jesus ham i
      Forkøbet og sagde: "Hvad tykkes dig, Simon? Af hvem tage Jordens
      Konger Told eller Skat, af deres egne Sønner eller af de
      fremmede?"
 26.  Og da han sagde: "Af de fremmede," sagde Jesus til ham: "Så ere
      jo Sønnerne fri.
 27.  Men for at vi ikke skulle forarge dem, så gå hen til Søen, kast
      en Krog ud, og tag den første Fisk, som kommer op; og når du
      åbner dens Mund, skal du finde en Stater; tag denne, og giv dem
      den for mig og dig!"

Matt. 18

  1.  I den samme Stund kom Disciplene hen til Jesus og sagde: "Hvem
      er da den største i Himmeriges Rige?"
  2.  Og han kaldte et lille Barn til sig og stillede det midt iblandt
      dem
  3.  og sagde: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, uden I omvende eder og
      blive som Børn, komme I ingenlunde ind i Himmeriges Rige.
  4.  Derfor, den, som fornedrer sig selv som dette Barn, han er den
      største i Himmeriges Rige.
  5.  Og den, som modtager et eneste sådant Barn for mit Navns Skyld,
      modtager mig.

  6.  Men den, som forarger een af disse små, som tro på mig, ham var
      det bedre, at der var hængt en Møllesten om hans Hals, og han
      var sænket i Havets Dyb.
  7.  Ve Verden for Forargelserne! Thi vel er det nødvendigt, at
      Forargelserne komme; dog ve det Menneske, ved hvem Forargelsen
      kommer!
  8.  Men dersom din Hånd eller din Fod forarger dig, da hug den af,
      og kast den fra dig! Det er bedre for dig at gå lam eller som en
      Krøbling ind til Livet end at have to Hænder og to Fødder og
      blive kastet i den evige Ild.
  9.  Og dersom dit Øje forarger dig, da riv det ud, og kast det fra
      dig!  Det er bedre for dig at gå enøjet ind til Livet end at
      have to Øjne og blive kastet i Helvedes Ild.

 10.  Ser til, at I ikke foragte en eneste af disse små; thi jeg siger
      eder: Deres Engle i Himlene se altid min Faders Ansigt, som er i
      Himlene.
 11.  Thi Menneskesønnen er kommen for at frelse det fortabte.
 12.  Hvad tykkes eder? Om et Menneske har hundrede Får, og eet af dem
      farer vild, forlader han da ikke de ni og halvfemsindstyve og
      går ud i Bjergene og leder efter det vildfarne?
 13.  Og hænder det sig, at han finder det, sandelig, siger jeg eder,
      han glæder sig mere over det end over de ni og halvfemsindstyve,
      som ikke ere farne vild.
 14.  Således er det ikke eders himmelske Faders Villie, at en eneste
      af disse små skal fortabes.

 15.  Men om din Broder synder imod dig, da gå hen og revs ham mellem
      dig og ham alene; hører han dig, da har du vundet din Broder.
 16.  Men hører han dig ikke, da tag endnu een eller to med dig, for
      at "hver Sag må stå fast efter to eller tre Vidners Mund."
 17.  Men er han dem overhørig, da sig det til Menigheden; men er han
      også Menigheden overhørig, da skal han være for dig ligesom en
      Hedning og en Tolder.
 18.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, hvad som helst I binde på Jorden, skal
      være bundet i Himmelen; og hvad som helst I løse på Jorden, skal
      være løst i Himmelen.
 19.  Atter siger jeg eder, at dersom to af eder blive enige på Jorden
      om hvilken som helst Sag, hvorom de ville bede, da skal det
      blive dem til Del fra min Fader, som er i Himlene.
 20.  Thi hvor to eller tre ere forsamlede om mit Navn, der er jeg
      midt iblandt dem."

 21.  Da trådte Peter frem og sagde til ham: "Herre! hvor ofte skal
      jeg tilgive min Broder, når han synder imod mig? mon indtil syv
      Gange?"
 22.  Jesus siger til ham: "Jeg siger dig: ikke indtil syv Gange, men
      indtil halvfjerdsindstyve Gange syv Gange.
 23.  Derfor lignes Himmeriges Rige ved en Konge, som vilde holde
      Regnskab med sine Tjenere.
 24.  Men da han begyndte at holde Regnskab, blev en, som var ti
      Tusinde Talenter skyldig, ført frem for ham.
 25.  Og da han intet havde at betale med, bød hans Herre, at han og
      hans Hustru og Børn og alt det, han havde, skulde sælges, og
      Gælden betales.
 26.  Da faldt Tjeneren ned for ham, bønfaldt ham og sagde: Herre, vær
      langmodig med mig, så vil jeg betale dig det alt sammen.
 27.  Da ynkedes samme Tjeners Herre inderligt over ham og lod ham løs
      og eftergav ham Gælden.
 28.  Men den samme Tjener gik ud og traf en af sine Medtjenere, som
      var ham hundrede Denarer skyldig; og han greb fat på ham og var
      ved at kvæle ham og sagde: Betal, hvad du er skyldig!
 29.  Da faldt hans Medtjener ned for ham og bad ham og sagde: Vær
      langmodig med mig, så vil jeg betale dig.
 30.  Men han vilde ikke, men gik hen og kastede ham i Fængsel, indtil
      han betalte, hvad han var skyldig.
 31.  Da nu hans Medtjenere så det, som skete, bleve de såre bedrøvede
      og kom og forklarede for deres Herre alt, hvad der var sket.
 32.  Da kalder hans Herre ham for sig og siger til ham: Du onde
      Tjener!  al den Gæld eftergav jeg dig, fordi du bad mig.
 33.  Burde ikke også du forbarme dig over din Medtjener, ligesom jeg
      har forbarmet mig over dig.
 34.  Og hans Herre blev vred og overgav ham til Bødlerne, indtil han
      kunde få betalt alt det, han var ham skyldig.
 35.  Således skal også min himmelske Fader gøre mod eder, om I ikke
      af Hjertet tilgive, enhver sin Broder."

Matt. 19

  1.  Og det skete, da Jesus havde fuldendt disse Ord, drog han bort
      fra Galilæa og kom til Judæas Egne, hinsides Jordan.
  2.  Og store Skarer fulgte ham, og han helbredte dem der.

  3.  Og Farisæerne kom til ham, fristede ham og sagde: "Er det
      tilladt at skille sig fra sin Hustru af hvilken som helst
      Grund?"
  4.  Men han svarede og sagde: "Have I ikke læst, at Skaberen fra
      Begyndelsen skabte dem som Mand og Kvinde
  5.  og sagde: Derfor skal en Mand forlade sin Fader og sin Moder og
      holde sig til sin Hustru, og de to skulle blive til eet Kød?
  6.  Således ere de ikke længer to, men eet Kød. Derfor, hvad Gud har
      sammenføjet, må et Menneske ikke adskille."
  7.  De sige til ham: "Hvorfor bød da Moses at give et Skilsmissebrev
      og skille sig fra hende?"
  8.  Han siger til dem: "Moses tilstedte eder at skille eder fra
      eders Hustruer for eders Hjerters Hårdheds Skyld; men fra
      Begyndelsen har det ikke været således.
  9.  Men jeg siger eder, at den, som skiller sig fra sin Hustru, når
      det ikke er for Hors Skyld, og tager en anden til Ægte, han
      bedriver Hor; og den, som tager en fraskilt Hustru til Ægte, han
      bedriver Hor."
 10.  Hans Disciple sige til ham: "Står Mandens Sag med Hustruen
      således, da er det ikke godt at gifte sig."
 11.  Men han sagde til dem: "Ikke alle rummer dette Ord, men de, hvem
      det er givet:
 12.  Thi der er Gildinger, som ere fødte således fra Moders Liv; og
      der er Gildinger, som ere gildede af Mennesker; og der er
      Gildinger, som have gildet sig selv for Himmeriges Riges
      Skyld. Den, som kan rumme det, han rumme det!"

 13.  Da blev der båret små Børn til ham, for at han skulde lægge
      Hænderne på dem og bede; men Disciplene truede dem.
 14.  Da sagde Jesus: "Lader de små Børn komme, og formener dem ikke
      at komme til mig; thi Himmeriges Rige hører sådanne til."
 15.  Og han lagde Hænderne på dem, og han drog derfra.

 16.  Og se, en kom til ham og sagde: "Mester! hvad godt skal jeg
      gøre, for at jeg kan få et evigt Liv?"
 17.  Men han sagde til ham: "Hvorfor spørger du mig om det gode? Een
      er den gode. Men vil du indgå til Livet, da hold Budene!"
 18.  Han siger til ham: "Hvilke?" Men Jesus sagde: "Dette: Du må ikke
      slå ihjel; du må ikke bedrive Hor; du må ikke stjæle; du må ikke
      sige falsk Vidnesbyrd;
 19.  ær din Fader og din Moder, og: Du skal elske din Næste som dig
      selv."
 20.  Den unge Mand siger til ham: "Det har jeg holdt alt sammen; hvad
      fattes mig endnu?"
 21.  Jesus sagde til ham: "Vil du være fuldkommen, da gå bort, sælg,
      hvad du ejer, og giv det til fattige, så skal du have en Skat i
      Himmelen; og kom så og følg mig!"
 22.  Men da den unge Mand hørte det Ord, gik han bedrøvet bort; thi
      han havde meget Gods.
 23.  Men Jesus sagde til sine Disciple: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder: En
      rig Kommer vanskeligt ind i Himmeriges Rige.
 24.  Atter siger jeg eder: Det er lettere for en Kamel at gå igennem
      et Nåleøje end for en rig at gå ind i Guds Rige."
 25.  Men da Disciplene hørte dette, forfærdedes de såre og sagde:
      "Hvem kan da blive frelst?"
 26.  Men Jesus så på dem og sagde: "For Mennesker er dette umuligt,
      men for Gud ere alle Ting mulige."

 27.  Da svarede Peter og sagde til ham: "Se, vi have forladt alle
      Ting og fulgt dig; hvad skulle da vi have?"
 28.  Men Jesus sagde til dem: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, at i
      Igenfødelsen, når Menneskesønnen sidder på sin Herligheds Trone,
      skulle også I, som have fulgt mig, sidde på tolv Troner og dømme
      Israels tolv Stammer.
 29.  Og hver, som har forladt Hus eller Brødre eller Søstre eller
      Fader eller Moder eller Hustru eller Børn eller Marker for mit
      Navns Skyld, skal få det mange Fold igen og arve et evigt Liv.
 30.  Men mange af de første skulle blive de sidste, og af de sidste
      de første.

Matt. 20

  1.  Thi Himmeriges Rige ligner en Husbond, som gik ud tidligt om
      Morgenen for at leje Arbejdere til sin Vingård.
  2.  Og da han var bleven enig med Arbejderne om en Denar om Dagen,
      sendte han dem til sin Vingård.
  3.  Og han gik ud ved den tredje Time og så andre stå ledige på
      Torvet,
  4.  og han sagde til dem: Går også I hen i Vingården, og jeg vil
      give eder, hvad som ret er. Og de gik derhen.
  5.  Han gik atter ud ved den sjette og niende Time og gjorde ligeså.
  6.  Og ved den ellevte Time gik han ud og fandt andre stående der,
      og han siger til dem: Hvorfor stå I her ledige hele Dagen?
  7.  De sige til ham: Fordi ingen lejede os. Han siger til dem: Går
      også I hen i Vingården!
  8.  Men da det var blevet Aften, siger Vingårdens Herre til sin
      Foged: Kald på Arbejderne, og betal dem deres Løn, idet du
      begynder med de sidste og ender med de første!
  9.  Og de, som vare lejede ved den ellevte Time, kom og fik hver en
      Denar.
 10.  Men da de første kom, mente de, at de skulde få mere; og også de
      fik hver en Denar.
 11.  Men da de fik den, knurrede de imod Husbonden og sagde:
 12.  Disse sidste have kun arbejdet een Time, og du har gjort dem
      lige med os, som have båret Dagens Byrde og Hede.
 13.  Men han svarede og sagde til en af dem: Ven! jeg gør dig ikke
      Uret; er du ikke bleven enig med mig om en Denar?
 14.  Tag dit og gå! Men jeg vil give denne sidste ligesom dig.
 15.  Eller har jeg ikke Lov at gøre med mit, hvad jeg vil? Eller er
      dit Øje ondt, fordi jeg er god?
 16.  Således skulle de sidste blive de første, og de første de
      sidste; thi mange ere kaldede, men få ere udvalgte."

 17.  Og da Jesus drog op til Jerusalem, tog han de tolv Disciple til
      Side og sagde til dem på Vejen:
 18.  "Se, vi drage op til Jerusalem, og Menneskesønnen skal overgives
      til Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge; og de skulle dømme ham
      til Døden
 19.  og overgive ham til Hedningerne til at spottes og hudstryges og
      korsfæstes; og på den tredje Dag skal han opstå."

 20.  Da gik Zebedæus's Sønners Moder til ham med sine Sønner og faldt
      ned for ham og vilde bede ham om noget.
 21.  Men han sagde til hende: "Hvad vil du?" Hun siger til ham: "Sig,
      at disse mine to Sønner skulle i dit Rige sidde den ene ved din
      højre, den anden ved din venstre Side."
 22.  Men Jesus svarede og sagde: "I vide ikke, hvad I bede om. Kunne
      I drikke den Kalk, som jeg skal drikke?" De sige til ham: "Det
      kunne vi."
 23.  Han siger til dem: "Min Kalk skulle I vel drikke; men det at
      sidde ved min højre og ved min venstre Side tilkommer det ikke
      mig at give; men det gives til dem, hvem det er beredt af min
      Fader."
 24.  Og da de ti hørte dette, bleve de vrede på de to Brødre.
 25.  Men Jesus kaldte dem til sig og sagde: "I vide, at Folkenes
      Fyrster herske over dem, og de store bruge Myndighed over dem.
 26.  Således skal det ikke være iblandt eder; men den, som vil blive
      stor iblandt eder, han skal være eders Tjener;
 27.  og den, som vil være den ypperste iblandt eder, han skal være
      eders Træl.
 28.  Ligesom Menneskesønnen ikke er kommen for at lade sig tjene, men
      for at tjene og give sit Liv til en Genløsning for mange."


 29.  Og da de gik ud af Jeriko, fulgte en stor Folkeskare ham.
 30.  Og se, to blinde sade ved Vejen, og da de hørte, at Jesus gik
      forbi, råbte de og sagde: "Herre, forbarm dig over os, du Davids
      Søn!"
 31.  Men Skaren truede dem, at de skulde tie; men de råbte endnu
      stærkere og sagde: "Herre, forbarm dig over os, du Davids Søn!"
 32.  Og Jesus stod stille og kaldte på dem og sagde: "Hvad ville I,
      at jeg skal gøre for eder?"
 33.  De sige til ham: "Herre! at vore Øjne måtte oplades."
 34.  Og Jesus ynkedes inderligt og rørte ved deres Øjne. Og straks
      bleve de seende, og de fulgte ham.

Matt. 21

  1.  Og da de nærmede sig Jerusalem og kom til Bethfage ved
      Oliebjerget, da udsendte Jesus to Disciple og sagde til dem:
  2.  "Går hen i den Landsby, som ligger lige for eder; og straks
      skulle I finde en Aseninde bunden og et Føl hos hende; løser dem
      og fører dem til mig!
  3.  Og dersom nogen siger noget til eder, da siger, at Herren har
      Brug for dem, så skal han straks sende dem."
  4.  Men dette er sket, for at det skulde opfyldes, der er talt ved
      Profeten, som siger:
  5.  "Siger til Zions Datter: Se, din Konge kommer til dig, sagtmodig
      og ridende på et Asen og på et Trældyrs Føl."
  6.  Men Disciplene gik hen og gjorde, som Jesus befalede dem;
  7.  og de hentede Aseninden og Føllet og lagde deres Klæder på dem,
      og han satte sig derpå.
  8.  Men de fleste af Folkeskaren bredte deres Klæder på Vejen, andre
      huggede Grene af Træerne og strøede dem på Vejen.
  9.  Men Skarerne, som gik foran ham og fulgte efter, råbte og sagde:
      "Hosanna Davids Søn! velsignet være den, som kommer, i Herrens
      Navn!  Hosanna i det højeste!"
 10.  Og da han drog ind i Jerusalem, kom hele Staden i Bevægelse og
      sagde: "Hvem er denne?"
 11.  Men Skarerne sagde: "Det er Profeten Jesus fra Nazareth i
      Galilæa."

 12.  Og Jesus gik ind i Guds Helligdom og uddrev alle dem, som solgte
      og købte i Helligdommen, og han væltede Vekselerernes Borde og
      Duekræmmernes Stole.
 13.  Og han siger til dem: "Der er skrevet: Mit Hus skal kaldes et
      Bedehus; men I gøre det til en Røverkule."
 14.  Og der kom blinde og lamme til ham i Helligdommen, og han
      helbredte dem.
 15.  Men da Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge så de Undergerninger,
      som han gjorde, og Børnene, som råbte i Helligdommen og sagde:
      "Hosanna Davids Søn!" bleve de vrede og sagde til ham:
 16.  "Hører du, hvad disse sige?" Men Jesus siger til dem: "Ja! have
      I aldrig læst: Af umyndiges og diendes Mund har du beredt dig
      Lovsang?"
 17.  Og han forlod dem og gik uden for Staden til Bethania og
      overnattede der.

 18.  Men da han om Morgenen igen gik ind til Staden, blev hen
      hungrig.
 19.  Og han så et Figentræ ved Vejen og gik hen til det, og han fandt
      intet derpå uden Blade alene. Og han siger til det: "Aldrig i
      Evighed skal der vokse Frugt mere på dig!" Og Figentræet visnede
      straks.
 20.  Og da Disciplene så det, forundrede de sig og sagde: "Hvorledes
      kunde Figentræet straks visne?"
 21.  Men Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder,
      dersom I have Tro og ikke tvivle, da skulle I ikke alene kunne
      gøre det med Figentræet, men dersom I endog sige til dette
      Bjerg: Løft dig op og kast dig i Havet, da skal det ske.
 22.  Og alt, hvad I begære i Bønnen troende, det skulle I få."

 23.  Og da han kom ind i Helligdommen, kom Ypperstepræsterne og
      Folkets Ældste hen til ham, medens han lærte, og de sagde: "Af
      hvad Magt gør du disse Ting, og hvem har givet dig denne Magt?"
 24.  Men Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Også jeg vil spørge eder om
      een Ting, og dersom I sige mig det, vil også jeg sige eder, af
      hvad Magt jeg gør disse Ting.
 25.  Johannes's Dåb, hvorfra var den? Fra Himmelen eller fra
      Mennesker?" Men de tænkte ved sig selv og sagde: "Sige vi: Fra
      Himmelen, da vil han sige til os: Hvorfor troede I ham da ikke?
 26.  Men sige vi: Fra Mennesker, frygte vi for Mængden; thi de holde
      alle Johannes for en Profet."
 27.  Og de svarede Jesus og sagde: "Det vide vi ikke." Da sagde også
      han til dem: "Så siger ikke heller jeg eder, af hvad Magt jeg
      gør disse Ting.

 28.  Men hvad tykkes eder? En Mand havde to Børn; og han gik til den
      første og sagde: Barn! gå hen, arbejd i Dag i min Vingård!
 29.  Men han svarede og sagde: Nej, jeg vil ikke; men bagefter
      fortrød han det og gik derhen.
 30.  Og han gik til den anden og sagde ligeså. Men han svarede og
      sagde: Ja, Herre! og gik ikke derhen.
 31.  Hvem af de to gjorde Faderens Villie?" De sige: "Den første."
      Jesus siger til dem: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, at Toldere og
      Skøger gå forud for eder ind i Guds Rige.
 32.  Thi Johannes kom til eder på Retfærdigheds Vej, og I troede ham
      ikke, men Toldere og Skøger troede ham; men endskønt I så det,
      fortrøde I det alligevel ikke bagefter, så I troede ham.

 33.  Hører en anden Lignelse: Der var en Husbond, som plantede en
      Vingård og satte et Gærde omkring den og gravede en Perse i den
      og byggede et Tårn; og han lejede den ud til Vingårdsmænd og
      drog udenlands.
 34.  Men da Frugttiden nærmede sig, sendte han sine Tjenere til
      Vingårdsmændene for at få dens Frugter.
 35.  Og Vingårdsmændene grebe hans Tjenere, og en sloge de, en dræbte
      de, og en stenede de.
 36.  Atter sendte han andre Tjenere hen, flere end de første; og de
      gjorde ligeså med dem.
 37.  Men til sidst sendte han sin Søn til dem og sagde: De ville
      undse sig for min Søn.
 38.  Men da Vingårdsmændene så Sønnen, sagde de til hverandre: Det er
      Arvingen; kommer lader os slå ham ihjel og få hans Arv!
 39.  Og de grebe ham og kastede ham ud af Vingården og sloge ham
      ihjel.
 40.  Når da Vingårdens Herre kommer, hvad vil han så gøre med disse
      Vingårdsmænd?"
 41.  De sige til ham: "Ilde vil han ødelægge de onde og leje sin
      Vingård ud til andre Vingårdsmænd, som ville give ham Frugterne
      i deres Tid."
 42.  Jesus siger til dem: "Have I aldrig læst i Skrifterne: Den Sten,
      som Bygningsmændene forkastede, den er bleven til en
      Hovedhjørnesten; fra Herren er dette kommet, og det er underligt
      for vore Øjne.
 43.  Derfor siger jeg eder, at Guds Rige skal tages fra eder og gives
      til et Folk, som bærer dets Frugter.
 44.  Og den, som falder på denne Sten, skal slå sig sønder; men hvem
      den falder på, ham skal den knuse."
 45.  Og da Ypperstepræsterne og Farisæerne hørte hans Lignelser,
      forstode de, at han talte om dem.
 46.  Og de søgte at gribe ham, men frygtede for Skarerne; thi de
      holdt ham for en Profet.

Matt. 22

  1.  Og Jesus tog til Orde og talte atter i Lignelser til dem og
      sagde:
  2.  "Himmeriges Rige lignes ved en Konge, som gjorde Bryllup for sin
      Søn.
  3.  Og han udsendte sine Tjenere for at kalde de budne til
      Brylluppet; og de vilde ikke komme.
  4.  Han udsendte atter andre Tjenere og sagde: Siger til de budne:
      Se, jeg har beredt mit Måltid, mine Okser og Fedekvæget er
      slagtet, og alting er rede; kommer til Brylluppet!
  5.  Men de brøde sig ikke derom og gik hen, den ene på sin Mark, den
      anden til sit Købmandsskab;
  6.  og de øvrige grebe hans Tjenere, forhånede og ihjelsloge dem.
  7.  Men Kongen blev vred og sendte sine Hære ud og slog disse
      Manddrabere ihjel og satte Ild på deres Stad.
  8.  Da siger han til sine Tjenere: Brylluppet er beredt, men de
      budne vare det ikke værd.
  9.  Går derfor ud på Skillevejene og byder til Brylluppet så mange,
      som I finde!
 10.  Og de Tjenere gik ud på Vejene og samlede alle dem, de fandt,
      både onde og gode; og Bryllupshuset blev fuldt af Gæster.
 11.  Da nu Kongen gik ind for at se Gæsterne, så han der et Menneske,
      som ikke var iført Bryllupsklædning.
 12.  Og han siger til ham: Ven! hvorledes er du kommen herind og har
      ingen Bryllupsklædning på? Men han tav.
 13.  Da sagde Kongen til Tjenerne: Binder Fødder og Hænder på ham, og
      kaster ham ud i Mørket udenfor; der skal der være Gråd og
      Tænders Gnidsel.
 14.  Thi mange ere kaldede, men få ere udvalgte."

 15.  Da gik Farisæerne hen og holdt Råd om, hvorledes de kunde fange
      ham i Ord.
 16.  Og de sende deres Disciple til ham tillige med Herodianerne og
      sige: "Mester! vi vide, at du er sanddru og lærer Guds Vej i
      Sandhed og ikke bryder dig om nogen; thi du ser ikke på
      Menneskers Person.
 17.  Sig os derfor: Hvad tykkes dig? Er det tilladt at give Kejseren
      Skat eller ej?"
 18.  Men da Jesus mærkede deres Ondskab, sagde han: "I Hyklere,
      hvorfor friste I mig?
 19.  Viser mig Skattens Mønt!" Og de bragte ham en Denar".
 20.  Og han siger til dem: "Hvis Billede og Overskrift er dette?"
 21.  De sige til ham: "Kejserens." Da siger han til dem: "Så giver
      Kejseren, hvad Kejserens er, og Gud, hvad Guds er!"
 22.  Og da de hørte det,undrede de sig, og de forlode ham og gik
      bort.

 23.  Samme Dag kom der Saddukæere til ham, hvilke sige, at der ingen
      Opstandelse er, og de spurgte ham og, sagde:
 24.  "Mester! Moses har sagt: Når nogen dør og ikke har Børn, skal
      hans Broder for Svogerskabets Skyld tage hans Hustru til Ægte og
      oprejse sin Broder Afkom.
 25.  Men nu var der hos os syv Brødre; og den første giftede sig og
      døde; og efterdi han ikke havde Afkom, efterlod han sin Hustru
      til sin Broder.
 26.  Ligeså også den anden og den tredje, indtil den syvende;
 27.  men sidst af alle døde Hustruen.
 28.  Hvem af disse syv skal nu have hende til Hustru i Opstandelsen?
      thi de have alle haft hende."
 29.  Men Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "I fare vild, idet I ikke
      kende Skrifterne, ej heller Guds Kraft.
 30.  Thi i Opstandelsen tage de hverken til Ægte eller bortgiftes,
      men de ere ligesom Guds Engle i Himmelen.
 31.  Men hvad de dødes Opstandelse angår, have I da ikke læst, hvad
      der er talt til eder af Gud, når han siger:
 32.  Jeg er Abrahams Gud og Isaks Gud og Jakobs Gud. Han er ikke
      dødes, men levendes Gud."
 33.  Og da Skarerne hørte dette, bleve de slagne af Forundring over
      hans Lære.

 34.  Men da Farisæerne hørte, at han havde stoppet Munden på
      Saddukæerne, forsamlede de sig.
 35.  Og en af dem, en lovkyndig, spurgte og fristede ham og sagde:
 36.  "Mester, hvilket er det store Bud i Loven?"
 37.  Men han sagde til ham: "Du skal elske Herren din Gud med hele
      dit Hjerte og med hele din Sjæl og med hele dit Sind.
 38.  Dette er det store og første Bud.
 39.  Men et andet er dette ligt: Du skal elske din Næste som dig
      selv.
 40.  Af disse to Bud afhænger hele Loven og Profeterne."

 41.  Men da Farisæerne vare forsamlede, spurgte Jesus dem og sagde:
 42.  "Hvad tykkes eder om Kristus? Hvis Søn er han?" De sige til ham:
      "Davids."
 43.  Han siger til dem: "Hvorledes kan da David i Ånden kalde ham
      Herre, idet han siger:
 44.  Herren sagde til min Herre: Sæt dig ved min højre Hånd, indtil
      jeg får lagt dine Fjender under dine Fødder.
 45.  Når nu David kalder ham Herre, hvorledes er han da hans Søn?"
 46.  Og ingen kunde svare ham et Ord, og ingen vovede mere at rette
      Spørgsmål til ham efter den Dag.

Matt. 23

  1.  Da talte Jesus til Skarerne og til sine Disciple og sagde:
  2.  På Mose Stol sidde de skriftkloge og Farisæerne.
  3.  Gører og holder derfor alt, hvad de sige eder; men gører ikke
      efter deres Gerninger; thi de sige det vel, men gøre det ikke.
  4.  Men de binde svare Byrder, vanskelige at bære, og lægge dem på
      Menneskenes Skuldre;men selv ville de ikke bevæge dem med en
      Finger.
  5.  Men de gøre alle deres Gerninger for at beskues af Menneskene;
      thi de gøre deres Bederemme brede og Kvasterne på deres Klæder
      store.
  6.  Og de ville gerne sidde øverst til Bords ved Måltiderne og på de
      fornemste Pladser i Synagogerne
  7.  og lade sig hilse på Torvene og kaldes Rabbi af Menneskene.
  8.  Men I skulle ikke lade eder kalde Rabbi; thi een er eders
      Mester, men I ere alle Brødre.
  9.  Og I skulle ikke kalde nogen på Jorden eders Fader; thi een er
      eders Fader, han, som er i Himlene.
 10.  Ej heller skulle I lade eder kalde Vejledere; thi een er eders
      Vejleder, Kristus.
 11.  Men den største iblandt eder skal være eders Tjener.
 12.  Men den, som ophøjer sig selv, skal fornedres, og den, som
      fornedrer sig selv, skal ophøjes.
 13.  Men ve eder, I skriftkloge og Farisæere, I Hyklere! thi I
      tillukke Himmeriges Rige for Menneskene; thi I gå ikke derind,
      og dem, som ville gå ind, tillade I det ikke.
 14.  Ve eder, I skriftkloge og Farisæere, I Hyklere! thi I opæde
      Enkers Huse og bede på Skrømt længe; derfor skulle I få des
      hårdere Dom.
 15.  Ve eder, I skriftkloge og Farisæere, I Hyklere! thi I drage om
      til Vands og til Lands for at vinde en eneste Tilhænger; og når
      han er bleven det, gøre I ham til et Helvedes Barn, dobbelt så
      slemt, som I selv ere.
 16.  Ve eder, I blinde Vejledere! I, som sige: Den, som sværger ved
      Templet, det er intet; men den, som sværger ved Guldet i
      Templet, han er forpligtet.
 17.  I Dårer og blinde! hvilket er da størst? Guldet eller Templet,
      som helliger Guldet?
 18.  Fremdeles: Den, som sværger ved Alteret, det er intet; men den,
      som sværger ved Gaven derpå, han er forpligtet.
 19.  I Dårer og blinde! hvilket er da størst? Gaven eller Alteret,
      som helliger Gaven?
 20.  Derfor, den, som sværger ved Alteret, sværger ved det og ved alt
      det, som er derpå.
 21.  Og den, som sværger ved Templet, sværger ved det og ved ham, som
      bor deri.
 22.  Og den, som sværger ved Himmelen, sværger ved Guds Trone og ved
      ham, som sidder på den.
 23.  Ve eder, I skriftkloge og Farisæere, I Hyklere! thi I give
      Tiende af Mynte og Dild og Kommen og have forsømt de Ting i
      Loven, der have større Vægt, Retten og Barmhjertigheden og
      Troskaben. Disse Ting burde man gøre og ikke forsømme hine.
 24.  I blinde Vejledere, I, som si Myggen af, men nedsluge Kamelen!
 25.  Ve eder, I skriftkloge og Farisæere, I Hyklere! thi I rense det
      udvendige af Bægeret og Fadet; men indvendigt ere de fulde af
      Rov og Umættelighed.
 26.  Du blinde Farisæer! rens først det indvendige af Bægeret og
      Fadet, for at også det udvendige af dem kan blive rent.
 27.  Ve eder, I skriftkloge og Farisæere, I Hyklere! thi I ere
      ligesom kalkede Grave, der jo synes dejlige udvendigt,men
      indvendigt ere fulde af døde Ben og al Urenhed.
 28.  Således synes også I vel udvortes retfærdige for Menneskene; men
      indvortes ere I fulde af Hykleri og Lovløshed.
 29.  Ve eder, I skriftkloge og Farisæere, I Hyklere! thi I bygge
      Profeternes Grave og pryde de retfærdiges Gravsteder og sige:
 30.  Havde vi været til i vore Fædres Dage, da havde vi ikke været
      delagtige med dem i Profeternes Blod.
 31.  Altså give I eder selv det Vidnesbyrd, at I ere Sønner af dem,
      som have ihjelslået Profeterne.
 32.  Så gører da også I eders Fædres Mål fuldt!
 33.  I Slanger! I Øgleunger! hvorledes kunne I undfly Helvedes Dom?

 34.  Derfor se, jeg sender til eder Profeter og vise og skriftkloge;
      nogle af dem skulle I slå ihjel og korsfæste, og nogle af dem
      skulle I hudstryge i, eders Synagoger og forfølge fra Stad til
      Stad,
 35.  for at alt det retfærdige Blod skal komme over eder, som er
      udgydt på Jorden, fra den retfærdige Abels Blod indtil
      Sakarias's, Barakias's Søns,Blod, hvem I sloge ihjel imellem
      Templet og Alteret.
 36.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, alt dette skal komme over denne Slægt.
 37.  Jerusalem! Jerusalem! som ihjelslår Profeterne og stener dem,
      som ere sendte til dig, hvor ofte vilde jeg samle dine Børn,
      ligesom en Høne samler sine Kyllinger under Vingerne! Og I vilde
      ikke.
 38.  Se, eders Hus lades eder øde!
 39.  Thi jeg siger eder: I skulle ingenlunde se mig fra nu af, indtil
      I sige: Velsignet være den, som kommer, i Herrens Navn!"

Matt. 24

  1.  Og Jesus gik ud, bort fra Helligdommen, og hans Disciple kom til
      ham for at vise ham Helligdommens Bygninger.
  2.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Se I ikke alt dette?
      Sandelig, siger jeg eder, her skal ikke lades Sten på Sten, som
      jo skal nedbrydes."
  3.  Men da han sad på Oliebjerget, kom hans Disciple til ham afsides
      og sagde: "Sig os, når skal dette ske? Og hvad er Tegnet på din
      Tilkommelse og Verdens Ende?"
  4.  Og Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Ser til, at ingen forfører
      eder!
  5.  Thi mange skulle på mit Navn komme og sige: Jeg er Kristus; og
      de skulle forføre mange.
  6.  Men I skulle få at høre om Krige og Krigsrygter. Ser til, lader
      eder ikke forskrække; thi det må ske; men Enden er ikke endda.
  7.  Thi Folk skal rejse sig mod Folk, og Rige mod Rige, og der skal
      være Hungersnød og Jordskælv her og der.
  8.  Men alt dette er Veernes Begyndelse.
  9.  Da skulle de overgive eder til Trængsel og slå eder ihjel, og I
      skulle hades af alle Folkeslagene for mit Navns Skyld.
 10.  Og da skulle mange forarges og forråde hverandre og hade
      hverandre.
 11.  Og mange falske Profeter skulle fremstå og forføre mange.
 12.  Og fordi Lovløsheden bliver mangfoldig, vil Kærligheden blive
      kold hos de fleste.
 13.  Men den, som holder ud indtil Enden, han skal frelses.
 14.  Og dette Rigets Evangelium skal prædikes i hele Verden til et
      Vidnesbyrd for alle Folkeslagene; og da skal Enden komme.
 15.  Når I da se Ødelæggelsens Vederstyggelighed, hvorom der er talt
      ved Profeten Daniel, stå på hellig Grund, (den, som læser det,
      han give Agt!)
 16.  da skulle de, som ere i Judæa, fly ud på Bjergene;
 17.  den, som er på Taget, stige ikke ned for at hente, hvad der er i
      hans Hus;
 18.  og den, som er på Marken, vende ikke tilbage før at hente sine
      Klæder!
 19.  Men ve de frugtsommelige og dem, som give Die, i de Dage!
 20.  Og beder om, at eders Flugt ikke skal ske om Vinteren, ej heller
      på en Sabbat;
 21.  thi der skal da være en Trængsel så stor, som der ikke har været
      fra Verdens Begyndelse indtil nu og heller ikke skal komme.
 22.  Og dersom disse Dage ikke bleve afkortede, da blev intet Kød
      frelst; men for de udvalgtes Skyld skulle disse Dage afkortes.
 23.  Dersom nogen da siger til eder: Se, her er Kristus, eller der!
      da skulle I ikke tro det.
 24.  Thi falske Krister og falske Profeter skulle fremstå og gøre
      store Tegn og Undergerninger, så at også de udvalgte skulde
      blive forførte, om det var muligt.
 25.  Se, jeg har sagt eder det forud.
 26.  Derfor, om de sige til eder: Se, han er i Ørkenen, da går ikke
      derud; se. han er i Kamrene, da tror det ikke!
 27.  Thi ligesom Lynet udgår fra Østen og lyser indtil Vesten,
      således skal Menneskesønnens Tilkommelse være.
 28.  Hvor Ådselet er, der ville Ørnene samle sig.
 29.  Men straks efter de Dages Trængsel skal Solen formørkes og Månen
      ikke give sit Skin og Stjernerne falde ned fra Himmelen, og
      Himmelens Kræfter skulle rystes.
 30.  Og da skal Menneskesønnens Tegn vise sig på Himmelen; og da
      skulle alle Jordens Stammer jamre sig, og de skulle se
      Menneskesønnen komme på Himmelens Skyer med Kraft og megen
      Herlighed.
 31.  Og han skal udsende sine Engle med stærktlydende Basun, og de
      skulle samle hans udvalgte fra de fire Vinde, fra den ene Ende
      af Himmelen til den anden.
 32.  Men lærer Lignelsen af Figentræet: Når dets Gren allerede er
      bleven blød,og Bladene skyde frem, da skønne I, at Sommeren er
      nær.
 33.  Således skulle også I, når I se alt dette, skønne, at han er nær
      for Døren.
 34.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, denne Slægt skal ingenlunde forgå,
      førend alle disse Ting ere skete.
 35.  Himmelen og Jorden skulle forgå, men mine Ord skulle ingenlunde
      forgå.
 36.  Men om den Dag og Time ved ingen, end ikke Himmelens Engle,
      heller ikke Sønnen, men kun Faderen alene.
 37.  Og ligesom Noas dage vare, således skal Menneskesønnens
      Tilkommelse være.
 38.  Thi ligesom de i Dagene før Syndfloden åde og drak, toge til
      Ægte og bortgiftede, indtil den Dag, da Noa gik ind i Arken,
 39.  og ikke agtede det, førend Syndfloden kom og tog dem alle bort,
      således skal også Menneskesønnens Tilkommelse være.
 40.  Da skulle to Mænd være på Marken; den ene tages med, og den
      anden lades tilbage.
 41.  To Kvinder skulle male på Kværnen; den ene tages med, og den
      anden lades tilbage.

 42.  Våger derfor, thi I vide ikke, på hvilken Dag eders Herre
      kommer.
 43.  Men dette skulle I vide, at dersom Husbonden vidste. i hvilken
      Nattevagt Tyven vilde komme, da vågede han og tillod ikke, at
      der skete Indbrud i hans Hus.
 44.  Derfor vorder også I rede; thi Menneskesønnen kommer i den Time,
      som I ikke mene.
 45.  Hvem er så den tro og forstandige Tjener, som hans Herre har sat
      over sit Tyende til at give dem deres Mad i rette Tid?
 46.  Salig er den Tjener, hvem hans Herre, når han kommer, finder
      handlende således.
 47.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, han skal sætte ham over alt, hvad han
      ejer.
 48.  Men dersom den onde Tjener siger i sit Hjerte: Min Herre tøver,
 49.  og så begynder at slå sine Medtjenere og spiser og drikker med
      Drankerne,
 50.  da skal den Tjeners Herre komme på den Dag, han ikke venter, og
      i den Time, han ikke ved,
 51.  og hugge ham sønder og give ham hans Lod sammen med Hyklerne;
      der skal der være Gråd og Tænders Gnidsel.

Matt. 25

  1.  Da skal Himmeriges Rige lignes ved ti Jomfruer, som toge deres
      Lamper og gik Brudgommen i Møde.
  2.  Men fem af dem vare Dårer, og fem kloge.
  3.  Dårerne toge nemlig deres Lamper, men toge ikke Olie med sig.
  4.  Men de kloge toge Olie i deres Kar tillige med deres Lamper.
  5.  Og da Brudgommen tøvede, slumrede de alle ind og sov.
  6.  Men ved Midnat lød der et Råb: Se, Brudgommen kommer, går ham i
      Møde!
  7.  Da vågnede alle Jomfruerne og gjorde deres Lamper i Stand.
  8.  Men Dårerne sagde til de kloge: Giver os af eders Olie; thi vore
      Lamper slukkes.
  9.  Men de kloge svarede og sagde: Der vilde vist ikke blive nok til
      os og til eder; går hellere hen til Købmændene og køber til eder
      selv!
 10.  Men medens de gik bort for at købe, kom Brudgommen, og de, som
      vare rede, gik ind med ham til Brylluppet; og Døren blev lukket.
 11.  Men senere komme også de andre Jomfruer og sige: Herre, Herre,
      luk op for os!
 12.  Men han svarede og sagde: Sandelig, siger jeg eder, jeg kender
      eder ikke.
 13.  Våger derfor, thi I vide ikke Dagen, ej heller Timen.

 14.  Thi det er ligesom en Mand, der drog udenlands og kaldte på sine
      Tjenere og overgav dem sin Ejendom;
 15.  og en gav han fem Talenter, en anden to, og en tredje en, hver
      efter hans Evne; og straks derefter drog han udenlands.
 16.  Men den, som havde fået de fem Talenter, gik hen og købslog med
      dem og vandt andre fem Talenter
 17.  Ligeså vandt også den, som havde fået de to Talenter,andre to.
 18.  Men den, som havde fået den ene, gik bort og gravede i Jorden og
      skjulte sin Herres Penge.
 19.  Men lang Tid derefter kommer disse Tjeneres Herre og holder
      Regnskab med dem.
 20.  Og den, som havde fået de fem Talenter, kom frem og bragte andre
      fem Talenter og sagde: Herre! du overgav mig fem Talenter; se,
      jeg har vundet fem andre Talenter.
 21.  Hans Herre sagde til ham: Vel, du gode og tro Tjener! du var tro
      over lidet, jeg vil sætte dig over meget; gå ind til din Herres
      Glæde!
 22.  Da kom også han frem, som havde fået de to Talenter, og sagde:
      Herre! du overgav mig to Talenter; se, jeg har vundet to andre
      Talenter.
 23.  Hans Herre sagde til ham: Vel, du gode og tro Tjener! du var tro
      over lidet, jeg vil sætte dig over meget; gå ind til din Herres
      glæde!
 24.  Men også han, som havde fået den ene Talent, kom frem og sagde:
      Herre! jeg kendte dig, at du er en hård Mand, som høster, hvor
      du ikke såede, og samler, hvor du ikke spredte;
 25.  og jeg frygtede og gik hen og skjulte din Talent i Jorden; se,
      her har du, hvad dit er.
 26.  Men hans Herre svarede og sagde til ham: Du onde og lade Tjener!
      du vidste, at jeg høster, hvor jeg ikke såede, og samler, hvor
      jeg ikke spredte;
 27.  derfor burde du have overgivet Vekselererne mine Penge; og når
      jeg kom, da havde jeg fået mit igen med Rente.
 28.  Tager derfor den Talent fra ham, og giver den til ham, som har
      de ti Talenter.
 29.  Thi enhver, som har, ham skal der gives, og han skal få
      Overflod; men den, som ikke har, fra ham skal endog det tages,
      som han har.
 30.  Og kaster den unyttige Tjener ud i Mørket udenfor; der skal der
      være Gråd og Tænders Gnidsel.

 31.  Men når Menneskesønnen kommer i sin Herlighed og alle Englene
      med ham, da skal han sidde på sin Herligheds Trone.
 32.  Og alle Folkeslagene skulle samles foran ham, og han skal skille
      dem fra hverandre, ligesom Hyrden skiller Fårene fra Bukkene.
 33.  Og han skal stille Fårene ved sin højre Side og Bukkene ved den
      venstre.
 34.  Da skal Kongen sige til dem ved sin højre Side: Kommer hid. I
      min Faders velsignede! arver det Rige, som har været eder beredt
      fra Verdens Grundlæggelse.
 35.  Thi jeg var hungrig, og I gave mig at spise; jeg var tørstig, og
      I gave mig at drikke; jeg var fremmed, og I toge mig hjem til
      eder;
 36.  jeg var nøgen, og I klædte mig; jeg var syg, og I besøgte mig;
      jeg var i Fængsel, og I kom til mig.
 37.  Da skulle de retfærdige svare ham og sige: Herre! når så vi dig
      hungrig og gave dig Mad, eller tørstig og gave dig at drikke?
 38.  Når så vi dig fremmed og toge dig hjem til os, eller nøgen og
      klædte dig?
 39.  Når så vi dig syg eller i Fængsel og kom til dig?
 40.  Og Kongen skal svare og sige til dem: Sandelig, siger jeg eder:
      Hvad I have gjort imod een af disse mine mindste Brødre, have I
      gjort imod mig.
 41.  Da skal han også sige til dem ved den venstre Side: Går bort fra
      mig, I forbandede! til den evige Ild, som er beredt Djævelen og
      hans Engle.
 42.  Thi jeg var hungrig, og I gave mig ikke at spise; jeg var
      tørstig, og I gave mig ikke at drikke;
 43.  jeg var fremmed, og I toge mig ikke hjem til eder; jeg var
      nøgen, og I klædte mig ikke; jeg var syg og i Fængsel, og I
      besøgte mig ikke.
 44.  Da skulle også de svare og sige: Herre! når så vi dig hungrig
      eller tørstig eller fremmed eller nøgen eller syg eller i
      Fængsel og tjente dig ikke?
 45.  Da skal han svare dem og sige: Sandelig, siger jeg eder: Hvad I
      ikke have gjort imod een af disse mindste, have I heller ikke
      gjort imod mig.
 46.  Og disse skulle gå bort til evig Straf, men de retfærdige til
      evigt Liv."

Matt. 26

  1.  Og det skete, da Jesus havde fuldendt alle disse Ord, sagde han
      til sine Disciple:
  2.  "I vide, at om to Dage er det Påske; så forrådes Menneskesønnen
      til at korsfæstes."

  3.  Da forsamledes Ypperstepræsterne og Folkets Ældste i
      Ypperstepræstens Gård; han hed Kajfas.
  4.  Og de rådsloge om at gribe Jesus med List og ihjelslå ham.
  5.  Men de sagde: "Ikke på Højtiden, for at der ikke skal blive
      Oprør iblandt Folket."

  6.  Men da Jesus var kommen til Bethania, i Simon den spedalskes
      Hus,
  7.  kom der en Kvinde til ham, som havde en Alabastkrukke med såre
      kostbar Salve, og hun udgød den på hans Hoved, medens han sad
      til Bords.
  8.  Men da Disciplene så det, bleve de vrede og sagde: "Hvortil
      denne Spilde?
  9.  Dette kunde jo være solgt til en høj Pris og være givet til
      fattige."
 10.  Men da Jesus mærkede det, sagde han til dem: "Hvorfor volde I
      Kvinden Fortrædeligheder? Hun har jo gjort en god Gerning imod
      mig.
 11.  Thi de fattige have I altid hos eder; men mig have I ikke altid.
 12.  Thi da hun udgød denne Salve over mit Legeme, gjorde hun det for
      at berede mig til at begraves.
 13.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, hvor som helst i hele Verden dette
      Evangelium bliver prædiket, skal også det, som hun har gjort,
      omtales til hendes Ihukommelse."

 14.  Da gik en af de tolv, han, som hed Judas Iskariot, hen til
      Ypperstepræsterne
 15.  og sagde: "Hvad ville I give mig, så skal jeg forråde ham til
      eder?" Men de betalte ham tredive Sølvpenge".
 16.  Og fra den Stund søgte han Lejlighed til at forråde ham.

 17.  Men på den første Dag af de usyrede Brøds Højtid kom Disciplene
      til Jesus og sagde: "Hvor vil du, at vi skulle træffe
      Forberedelse for dig til at spise Påskelammet?"
 18.  Men han sagde: "Går ind i Staden til den og den Mand, og siger
      til ham: Mesteren siger: Min Time er nær; hos dig holder jeg
      Påske med mine Disciple."
 19.  Og Disciplene gjorde, som Jesus befalede dem, og beredte
      Påskelammet.
 20.  Men da det var blevet Aften, sad han til Bords med de tolv.
 21.  Og medens de spiste, sagde han: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, en af
      eder vil forråde mig."
 22.  Og de bleve såre bedrøvede og begyndte hver især at sige til
      ham: "Det er dog vel ikke mig, Herre?"
 23.  Men han svarede og sagde: "Den, som dyppede Hånden tillige med
      mig i Fadet, han vil forråde mig.
 24.  Menneskesønnen går vel bort, som der er skrevet om ham; men ve
      det Menneske, ved hvem Menneskesønnen bliver forrådt! Det var
      godt for det Menneske, om han ikke var født."
 25.  Men Judas, som forrådte ham, svarede og sagde: "Det er dog vel
      ikke mig, Rabbi?" Han siger til ham: "Du har sagt det."

 26.  Men medens de spiste, tog Jesus Brød, og han velsignede og brød
      det og gav Disciplene det og sagde: "Tager, æder; dette er mit
      Legeme."
 27.  Og han tog en Kalk og takkede. gav dem den og sagde: "Drikker
      alle deraf;
 28.  thi dette er mit Blod, Pagtens, hvilket udgydes for mange til
      Syndernes Forladelse.
 29.  Men jeg siger eder, fra nu af skal jeg ingenlunde drikke af
      denne Vintræets Frugt indtil den Dag, da jeg skal drikke den ny
      med eder i min Faders Rige."

 30.  Og da de havde sunget Lovsangen, gik de ud til Oliebjerget.
 31.  Da siger Jesus til dem: "I skulle alle forarges på mig i denne
      Nat; thi der er skrevet: Jeg vil slå Hyrden, og Hjordens Får
      skulle adspredes.
 32.  Men efter at jeg er bleven oprejst, vil jeg gå forud for eder
      til Galilæa."
 33.  Men Peter svarede og sagde til ham: "Om end alle ville forarges
      på dig, så vil jeg dog aldrig forarges."
 34.  Jesus sagde til ham: "Sandelig, siger jeg dig, i denne Nat,
      førend Hanen galer, skal du fornægte mig tre Gange."
 35.  Peter siger til ham: "Om jeg end skulde dø med dig, vil jeg
      ingenlunde fornægte dig." Ligeså sagde også alle Disciplene.

 36.  Da kommer Jesus med dem til en Gård, som kaldes Gethsemane, og
      han siger til Disciplene: "Sætter eder her, medens jeg går
      derhen og beder."
 37.  Og han tog Peter og Zebedæus's to Sønner med sig, og han
      begyndte at bedrøves og svarlig at ængstes.
 38.  Da siger han til dem: "Min Sjæl er dybt bedrøvet indtil Døden;
      bliver her og våger med mig!"
 39.  Og han gik lidt frem, faldt på sit Ansigt, bad og sagde: "Min
      Fader! er det muligt, da gå denne Kalk mig forbi; dog ikke som
      jeg vil, men som du vil."
 40.  Og han kommer til Disciplene og finder dem sovende, og han siger
      til Peter: "Så kunde I da ikke våge een Time med mig!
 41.  Våger og beder, for at I ikke skulle falde i Fristelse! Ånden er
      vel redebon, men Kødet er skrøbeligt."
 42.  Han gik atter anden Gang hen, bad og sagde: "Min Fader! hvis
      denne Kalk ikke kan gå mig forbi, uden jeg drikker den, da ske
      din Villie!"
 43.  Og han kom og fandt dem atter sovende, thi deres Øjne vare
      betyngede.
 44.  Og han forlod dem og gik atter hen og bad tredje Gang og sagde
      atter det samme Ord.
 45.  Da kommer han til Disciplene og siger til dem: "Sove I fremdeles
      og Hvile eder? Se, Timen er nær, og Menneskesønnen forrådes i
      Synderes Hænder.
 46.  Står op, lader os gå; se, han, som forråder mig, er nær."

 47.  Og medens han endnu talte, se, da kom Judas, en af de tolv, og
      med ham en stor Skare, med Sværd og Knipler, fra
      Ypperstepræsterne og Folkets Ældste.
 48.  Men han, som forrådte ham, havde givet dem et Tegn og sagt:
      "Den, som jeg kysser, ham er det; griber ham!"
 49.  Og han trådte straks hen til Jesus og sagde: "Hil være dig,
      Rabbi!" og kyssede ham.
 50.  Men Jesus sagde til ham: "Ven, hvorfor kommer du her?" Da trådte
      de til og lagde Hånd på Jesus og grebe ham.
 51.  Og se, en af dem, som vare med Jesus, rakte Hånden ud og drog
      sit Sværd og slog Ypperstepræstens Tjener og huggede hans Øre
      af.
 52.  Da siger Jesus til ham: "Stik dit Sværd igen på dets Sted; thi
      alle de, som tage Sværd, skulle omkomme ved Sværd.
 53.  Eller mener du, at jeg ikke kan bede min Fader, så han nu
      tilskikker mig mere end tolv Legioner Engle?
 54.  Hvorledes skulde da Skrifterne opfyldes, at det bør gå således
      til?"
 55.  I den samme Time sagde Jesus til Skarerne: "I ere gåede ud
      ligesom imod en Røver med Sværd og Knipler for at fange
      mig. Daglig sad jeg i Helligdommen og lærte, og I grebe mig
      ikke.
 56.  Men det er alt sammen sket, for at Profeternes Skrifter skulde
      opfyldes." Da forlode alle Disciplene ham og flyede.

 57.  Men de, som havde grebet Jesus, førte ham hen til
      Ypperstepræsten Kajfas, hvor de skriftkloge og de Ældste vare
      forsamlede.
 58.  Men Peter fulgte ham i Frastand indtil Ypperstepræstens Gård, og
      han gik indenfor og satte sig hos Svendene for at se, hvad
      Udgang det vilde få.
 59.  Men Ypperstepræsterne og hele Rådet søgte falsk Vidnesbyrd imod
      Jesus, for at de kunde aflive ham.
 60.  Og de fandt intet, endskønt der trådte mange falske Vidner frem.
      Men til sidst trådte to frem og sagde:
 61.  "Denne har sagt: Jeg kan nedbryde Guds Tempel og bygge det op i
      tre Dage."
 62.  Og Ypperstepræsten stod op og sagde til ham: "Svarer du intet
      på, hvad disse vidne imod dig?"
 63.  Men Jesus tav. Og Ypperstepræsten tog til Orde og sagde til ham:
      "Jeg besværger dig ved den levende Gud, at du siger os, om du er
      Kristus, Guds Søn."
 64.  Jesus siger til ham: "Du har sagt det; dog jeg siger eder: Fra
      nu af skulle I se Menneskesønnen sidde ved Kraftens højre Hånd
      og komme på Himmelens Skyer."
 65.  Da sønderrev Ypperstepræsten sine Klæder og sagde: "Han har talt
      bespotteligt; hvad have vi længere Vidner nødig? se, nu have I
      hørt Bespottelsen.
 66.  Hvad tykkes eder?" Og de svarede og sagde: "Han er skyldig til
      Døden."
 67.  Da spyttede de ham i Ansigtet og gave ham Næveslag; andre sloge
      ham på Kinden
 68.  og sagde: "Profeter os, Kristus, hvem var det, der slog dig?"

 69.  Men Peter sad udenfor i Gården; og en Pige kom hen til ham og
      sagde: "Også du var med Jesus Galilæeren."
 70.  Men han nægtede det i alles Påhør og sagde: "Jeg forstår ikke,
      hvad du siger."
 71.  Men da han gik ud i Portrummet, så en anden Pige ham; og hun
      siger til dem, som vare der: "Denne var med Jesus af Nazareth."
 72.  Og han nægtede det atter med en Ed: "Jeg kender ikke det
      Menneske."
 73.  Men lidt efter kom de, som stode der, hen og sagde til Peter:
      "Sandelig, også du er en af dem. dit Mål røber dig jo også."
 74.  Da begyndte han at forbande sig og sværge: "Jeg kender ikke det
      Menneske." Og straks galede Hanen.
 75.  Og Peter kom Jesu Ord i Hu at han havde sagt: "Førend Hanen
      galer, skal du fornægte mig tre Gange." Og han gik udenfor og
      græd bitterligt.

Matt. 27

  1.  Men da det var blevet Morgen, holdt alle Ypperstepræsterne og
      Folkets Ældste Råd imod Jesus for at aflive ham.
  2.  Og de bandt ham og førte ham bort og overgave ham til
      Landshøvdingen Pontius Pilatus.

  3.  Da nu Judas, som forrådte ham, så, at han var bleven domfældt,
      fortrød han det og bragte de tredive Sølvpenge tilbage til
      Ypperstepræsterne og de Ældste og sagde:
  4.  "Jeg har syndet, idet jeg forrådte uskyldigt Blod." Men de
      sagde: "Hvad kommer det os ved? se du dertil."
  5.  Og han kastede Sølvpengene ind i Templet, veg bort og gik hen og
      hængte sig.
  6.  Men Ypperstepræsterne toge Sølvpengene og sagde: "Det er ikke
      tilladt at lægge dem til Tempelskatten; thi det er Blodpenge."
  7.  Men efter at have holdt Råd købte de Pottemagermarken derfor til
      Gravsted for de fremmede.
  8.  Derfor blev den Mark kaldt Blodmarken indtil den Dag i Dag.
  9.  Da opfyldtes det, som er talt ved Profeten Jeremias, som siger:
      "Og de toge de tredive Sølvpenge, Prisen for den vurderede, hvem
      de vurderede for Israels Børn,
 10.  og de gav dem for Pottemagermarken, som Herren befalede mig."

 11.  Men Jesus blev stillet for Landshøvdingen, og Landshøvdingen
      spurgte ham og sagde: "Er du Jødernes Konge?" Men Jesus sagde
      til ham: "Du siger det."
 12.  Og da han blev anklaget af Ypperstepræsterne og de Ældste,
      svarede han intet.
 13.  Da siger Pilatus til ham: "Hører du ikke, hvor meget de vidne
      imod dig?"
 14.  Og han svarede ham end ikke på et eneste Ord, så at
      Landshøvdingen undrede sig såre.
 15.  Men på Højtiden plejede Landshøvdingen at løslade Mængden een
      Fange, hvilken de vilde.
 16.  Og de havde dengang en berygtet Fange, som hed Barabbas.
 17.  Da de vare forsamlede, sagde Pilatus derfor til dem: "Hvem ville
      I, at jeg skal løslade eder: Barabbas eller Jesus, som kaldes
      Kristus?"
 18.  Thi han vidste, at det var af Avind, de havde overgivet ham.
 19.  Men medens han sad på Dommersædet, sendte hans Hustru Bud til
      ham og sagde: "Befat dig ikke med denne retfærdige; thi jeg har
      lidt meget i Dag i en Drøm før hans Skyld."
 20.  Men Ypperstepræsterne og de Ældste overtalte Skarerne til, at de
      skulde begære Barabbas, men ihjelslå Jesus.
 21.  Og Landshøvdingen svarede og sagde til dem: "Hvilken af de to
      ville I, at jeg skal løslade eder?" Men de sagde: "Barabas."
 22.  Pilatus siger til dem: "Hvad skal jeg da gøre med Jesus, som
      kaldes Kristus?" De sige alle: "Lad ham blive korsfæstet!"
 23.  Men Landshøvdingen sagde: "Hvad ondt har han da gjort?" Men de
      råbte end mere og sagde: "Lad ham blive korsfæstet!"
 24.  Men da Pilatus så, at han intet udrettede, men at der blev
      større Larm, tog han Vand og toede sine Hænder i Mængdens Påsyn
      og sagde: "Jeg er uskyldig i denne retfærdiges Blod; ser I
      dertil!"
 25.  Og hele Folket svarede og sagde: "Hans Blod komme over os og
      over vore Børn!"
 26.  Da løslod han dem Barabbas; men Jesus lod han hudstryge og gav
      ham hen til at korsfæstes.

 27.  Da toge Landshøvdingens Stridsmænd Jesus med sig ind i Borgen og
      samlede hele Vagtafdelingen omkring ham.
 28.  Og de afklædte ham og kastede en Skarlagens Kappe om ham.
 29.  Og de flettede en Krone af Torne og satte den på hans Hoved og
      gave ham et Rør i hans højre Hånd; og de faldt på Knæ for ham og
      spottede ham og sagde: "Hil være dig, du Jødernes Konge!"
 30.  Og de spyttede på ham og toge Røret og sloge ham på Hovedet.
 31.  Og da de havde spottet ham, toge de Kappen af ham og iførte ham
      hans egne Klæder og førte ham hen for at korsfæste ham.

 32.  Men medens de gik derud, traf de en Mand fra Kyrene, ved Navn
      Simon; ham tvang de til at bære hans Kors.
 33.  Og da de kom til et Sted, som kaldes Golgatha, det er udlagt:
      "Hovedskalsted",
 34.  gave de ham Eddike at drikke blandet med Galde og da han smagte
      det, vilde han ikke drikke.
 35.  Men da de havde korsfæstet ham, delte de hans Klæder imellem sig
      ved Lodkastning, for at det skulde opfyldes, som er sagt af
      Profeten: "De delte mine Klæder imellem sig og kastede Lod om
      mit Klædebon."
 36.  Og de sade der og holdt Vagt over ham.
 37.  Og oven over hans Hoved satte de Beskyldningen imod ham skreven
      således: "Dette er Jesus, Jødernes Konge."
 38.  Da bliver der korsfæstet to Røvere sammen med ham, en ved den
      højre og en ved den venstre Side,
 39.  Og de, som gik forbi, spottede ham, idet de rystede på deres
      Hoveder og sagde:
 40.  "Du, som nedbryder Templet og bygger det op i tre Dage, frels
      dig selv; er du Guds Søn, da stig ned af Korset!"
 41.  "Ligeså spottede Ypperstepræsterne tillige med de skriftkloge og
      de Ældste og sagde:
 42.  "Andre har han frelst, sig selv kan han ikke frelse; er han
      Israels Konge, så lad ham nu stige ned af Korset, så ville vi
      tro på ham.
 43.  Han har sat sin Lid til Gud;han fri ham nu, om han har Behag i
      ham; thi han har sagt: Jeg er Guds Søn."
 44.  Og på samme Måde hånede også Røverne ham, som vare korsfæstede
      med ham.
 45.  Men fra den sjette Time blev der Mørke over hele Landet indtil
      den niende Time.
 46.  Og ved den niende Time råbte Jesus med høj Røst og sagde: "Eli!
      Eli! Lama Sabaktani?" det er: "Min Gud! min Gud! hvorfor har du
      forladt mig?"
 47.  Men nogle af dem, som stode der og hørte det, sagde: "Han kalder
      på Elias."
 48.  Og straks løb en af dem hen og tog en Svamp og fyldte den med
      Eddike og stak den på et Rør og gav ham at drikke.
 49.  Men de andre sagde: "Holdt! lader os se, om Elias kommer for at
      frelse ham."
 50.  Men Jesus råbte atter med høj Røst og opgav Ånden.
 51.  Og se, Forhænget i Templet splittedes i to Stykker, fra øverst
      til nederst; og Jorden skjalv, og Klipperne revnede,
 52.  og Gravene åbnedes; og mange af de hensovede helliges legemer
      bleve oprejste,
 53.  og de gik ud af Gravene efter hans Opstandelse og kom ind i den
      hellige Stad og viste sig for mange.
 54.  Men da Høvedsmanden og de, som tillige med, ham holdt Vagt over
      Jesus, så Jordskælvet, og hvad der skete, frygtede de såre og
      sagde: "Sandelig, denne var Guds Søn."
 55.  Men der var mange Kvinder der, som så til i Frastand, hvilke
      havde fulgt Jesus fra Galilæa og tjent ham.
 56.  Iblandt dem vare Maria Magdalene og Maria, Jakobs og Josefs
      Moder, og Zebedæus's Sønners Moder.

 57.  Men da det var blevet Aften, kom en rig Mand fra Arimathæa, ved
      Navn Josef, som også selv var bleven Jesu Discipel.
 58.  Han gik til Pilatus og bad om Jesu Legeme. Da befalede Pilatus,
      at det skulde udleveres.
 59.  Og Josef tog Legemet og svøbte det i et rent, fint Linklæde
 60.  og lagde det i sin nye Grav, som han havde ladet hugge i
      Klippen, og væltede en stor Sten for Indgangen til Graven og gik
      bort.
 61.  Men Maria Magdalene og den anden Maria vare der, og de sade lige
      over for Graven.

 62.  Men den næste Dag, som var Dagen efter Beredelsesdagen,
      forsamlede Ypperstepræsterne og Farisæerne sig hos Pilatus
 63.  og sagde: "Herre! vi ere komne i Hu, at denne Forfører sagde,
      medens han endnu levede: Tre Dage efter bliver jeg oprejst.
 64.  Befal derfor, at Graven skal sikkert bevogtes indtil den tredje
      Dag, for at ikke hans Disciple skulle komme og stjæle ham og
      sige til Folket: "Han er oprejst fra de døde; og da vil den
      sidste Forførelse blive værre end den første,"
 65.  Pilatus sagde til dem: "Der have I en Vagt; går hen og bevogter
      den sikkert, som I bedst vide!"
 66.  Og de gik hen og bevogtede Graven sikkert med Vagten efter at
      have sat Segl for Stenen.

Matt. 28

  1.  Men efter Sabbaten, da det gryede ad den første Dag i Ugen, kom
      Maria Magdalene og den anden Maria for at se til Graven.
  2.  Og se, der skete et stort Jordskælv; thi en Herrens Engel for
      ned fra Himmelen og trådte til og væltede Stenen bort og satte
      sig på den.
  3.  Men hans Udseende var ligesom et Lyn og hans Klædebon hvidt som
      Sne.
  4.  Men de, som holdt Vagt, skælvede af Frygt for ham og bleve som
      døde.
  5.  Men Engelen tog til Orde og sagde til Kvinderne: "I skulle ikke
      frygte! thi jeg ved, at I lede efter Jesus den korsfæstede.
  6.  Han er ikke her; thi han er opstanden, som han har sagt. Kommer
      hid, ser Stedet, hvor Herren lå!
  7.  Og går hastigt hen og siger hans Disciple, at han er opstanden
      fra de døde; og se, han går forud for eder til Galilæa; der
      skulle I se ham. Se, jeg har sagt eder det."
  8.  Og de gik hastig bort fra Graven med Frygt og stor Glæde og løb
      hen for at forkynde hans Disciple det.
  9.  Men medens de gik for at forkynde hans Disciple det, se, da
      mødte Jesus dem og sagde: "Hil være eder!" Men de trådte til og
      omfavnede hans Fødder og tilbade ham.
 10.  Da siger Jesus til dem: "Frygter ikke! går hen og forkynder mine
      Brødre, at de skulle gå bort til Galilæa, og der skulle de se
      mig."

 11.  Men medens de gik derhen, se da kom nogle af Vagten ind i Staden
      og meldte Ypperstepræsterne alt det, som var sket.
 12.  Og de samledes med de Ældste og holdt Råd og gave Stridsmændene
      rigelige Penge
 13.  og sagde: "Siger: Hans Disciple kom om Natten og stjal ham,
      medens vi sov.
 14.  Og dersom Landshøvdingen får det at høre, ville vi stille ham
      tilfreds og holde eder angerløse."
 15.  Men de toge Pengene og gjorde, som det var lært dem. Og dette
      Ord blev udspredt iblandt Jøderne indtil den Dag i Dag.

 16.  Men de elleve Disciple gik til Galilæa, til det Bjerg, hvor
      Jesus havde sat dem Stævne.
 17.  Og da de så ham tilbade de ham; men nogle tvivlede.
 18.  Og Jesus trådte frem, talte til dem og sagde: "Mig er given al
      Magt i Himmelen og på Jorden.
 19.  Går derfor hen og gører alle Folkeslagene til mine Disciple,
      idet I døbe dem til Faderens og Sønnens og den Helligånds Navn,
 20.  og idet I lære dem at holde alt det, som jeg har befalet
      eder. Og se, jeg er med eder alle Dage indtil Verdens Ende."


Markus

Markus 1

  1.  Jesu Kristi, Guds Søns, Evangeliums Begyndelse er således,
  2.  som der er skrevet hos Profeten Esajas: "Se, jeg sender min
      Engel for dit Ansigt, han skal berede din Vej.
  3.  Der er en Røst af en, som råber i Ørkenen: Bereder Herrens Vej,
      gører hans Stier jævne!"
  4.  Johannes kom, han, som døbte i Ørkenen og prædikede
      Omvendelses-Dåb til Syndernes Forladelse.
  5.  Og hele Judæas Land og alle i Jerusalem gik ud og bleve døbt, af
      ham i Floden Jordan, idet de bekendte deres Synder
  6.  Og Johannes var klædt i Kamelhår og havde et Læderbælte om sin
      Lænd og spiste Græshopper og vild Honning.
  7.  Og han prædikede og sagde: "Efter mig kommer den, som er
      stærkere end jeg, hvis Skotvinge jeg ikke er værdig at bøje mig
      ned og løse.
  8.  Jeg har døbt eder med Vand, men han skal døbe eder med den
      Helligånd."

  9.  Og det skete i de dage, at Jesus kom fra Nazareth i Galilæa og
      blev døbt af Johannes i Jordan.
 10.  Og straks da han steg op af Vandet, så han Himlene skilles ad og
      Ånden ligesom en Due dale ned over ham;
 11.  og der kom en Røst fra Himlene: "Du er min Søn, den elskede, i
      dig har jeg Velbehag."

 12.  Og straks driver Ånden ham ud i Ørkenen.
 13.  Og han var i Ørkenen fyrretyve Dage, medens han fristedes af
      Satan, og han var blandt Dyrene; og Englene tjente ham.

 14.  Men efter at Johannes var kastet i Fængsel, kom Jesus til
      Galilæa og prædikede Guds Evangelium
 15.  og sagde: "Tiden er fuldkommet, og Guds Rige er kommet nær;
      omvender eder og tror på Evangeliet!"

 16.  Og medens han gik langs Galilæas Sø, så han Simon og Simons
      Broder Andreas i Færd med at kaste Garn i Søen; thi de vare
      Fiskere.
 17.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "Følger efter mig, så vil jeg gøre eder
      til Menneskefiskere."
 18.  Og de forlode straks Garnene og fulgte ham.
 19.  Og da han gik lidt videre frem, så han, Jakob, Zebedæus's Søn,
      og hans Broder Johannes, som også vare i Færd med at bøde deres
      Garn i Skibet;
 20.  og han kaldte straks på dem, og de forlode deres Fader Zebedæus
      i Skibet med Lejesvendene og gik efter ham.

 21.  Og de gå ind i Kapernaum. Og straks på Sabbaten gik han ind i
      Synagogen og lærte,
 22.  og de bleve slagne af Forundring over hans Lære; thi han lærte
      dem som en, der havde Myndighed, og ikke som de skriftkloge.
 23.  Og der var i deres Synagoge et Menneske med en uren Ånd, og han
      råbte højt
 24.  og sagde: "Hvad have vi med dig at gøre, Jesus af Nazareth? Er
      du kommen for at ødelægge os; jeg kender dig, hvem du er, du
      Guds hellige."
 25.  Og Jesus truede ham og sagde: "Ti, og far ud af ham!"
 26.  Og den urene Ånd sled i ham og råbte med høj Røst og for ud af
      ham.
 27.  Og de bleve alle forfærdede, så at de spurgte hverandre og
      sagde: "Hvad er dette? en ny Lære med Myndighed; også over de
      urene Ånder byder han, og de lyde ham."
 28.  Og Rygtet om ham kom straks ud alle Vegne i hele det omliggende
      Land i Galilæa.

 29.  Og straks, da de vare gåede ud af Synagogen, kom de ind i Simons
      og Andreas's Hus med Jakob og Johannes.
 30.  Men Simons Svigermoder lå og havde Feber, og straks tale de til
      ham om hende;
 31.  og han gik hen til hende, tog hende ved Hånden og rejste hende
      op, og Feberen forlod hende, og hun vartede dem op.
 32.  Men da det var blevet Aften, og Solen var gået ned, førte de til
      ham alle de syge og besatte,
 33.  og hele Byen var forsamlet foran Døren.
 34.  Og han helbredte mange, som lede af mange Hånde Sygdomme, og han
      uddrev mange onde Ånder; og han tillod ikke de onde Ånder at
      tale, fordi de kendte ham.

 35.  Og om Morgenen længe før Dag stod han op og gik ud og gik hen
      til et øde Sted, og der bad han:
 36.  Og Simon og de, som vare med ham, skyndte sig efter ham.
 37.  Og de fandt ham, og de sige til ham: "Alle lede efter dig."
 38.  Og han siger til dem: "Lader os gå andetsteds hen til de
      nærmeste Småbyer, for at jeg kan prædike også der; thi dertil er
      jeg udgået."
 39.  Og han kom og prædikede i deres Synagoger i hele Galilæa og
      uddrev de onde Ånder.

 40.  Og en spedalsk kommer til ham, beder ham og falder på Knæ for
      ham og siger til ham: "Om du vil, så kan du rense mig."
 41.  Og han ynkedes inderligt og udrakte Hånden og rørte ved ham og
      siger til ham: "Jeg vil; bliv ren!"
 42.  Og straks forlod Spedalskheden ham, og han blev renset.
 43.  Og han drev ham straks bort, idet han bød ham strengt
 44.  og sagde til ham: "Se til, at du ikke siger noget til nogen
      herom; men gå hen, fremstil dig selv for Præsten, og offer for
      din Renselse det, som Moses har befalet, til Vidnesbyrd for
      dem!"
 45.  Men da han kom ud, begyndte han at fortælle meget og udsprede
      Rygtet derom, så at han ikke mere kunde gå åbenlyst ind i en By;
      men han var udenfor på øde Steder, og de kom til ham alle Vegne
      fra.

Markus 2

  1.  Og da han nogle Dage derefter atter gik ind i Kapernaum,
      spurgtes det, at han var hjemme.
  2.  Og der samledes mange, så at der ikke mere var Plads, end ikke
      foran Døren; og han talte Ordet til dem.
  3.  Og de komme og bringe til ham en værkbruden, der blev båren af
      fire.
  4.  Og da de ikke kunde komme nær til ham for Folkeskaren, toge de
      Taget af, hvor han var; og da de havde brudt Hul, firede de
      Sengen ned, hvorpå den værkbrudne lå.
  5.  Og da Jesus så deres Tro, siger han til den værkbrudne: "Søn!
      dine Synder ere forladte."
  6.  Men nogle af de skriftkloge sade der og tænkte i deres Hjerter:
  7.  "Hvorfor taler denne således.? Han taler bespotteligt. Hvem kan
      forlade Synder uden een, nemlig Gud?"
  8.  Og Jesus kendte straks i sin Ånd, at de tænkte således ved sig
      selv, og sagde til dem: "Hvorfor tænke I dette i eders Hjerter?
  9.  Hvilket er lettest, at sige til den værkbrudne: Dine Synder ere
      forladte, eller at sige: Stå op, og tag din Seng, og gå?
 10.  Men for at I skulle vide, at Menneskesønnen har Magt på Jorden
      til at forlade Synder," siger han til den værkbrudne:
 11.  "Jeg siger dig: Stå op, tag din Seng, og gå til dit Hus!"
 12.  Og han stod op og tog straks Sengen og gik ud for alles Øjne, så
      de alle bleve forfærdede og priste Gud og sagde: "Aldrig have vi
      set noget sådant."

 13.  Og han gik atter ud langs Søen, og hele Skaren kom til ham, og
      han lærte dem.
 14.  Og da han gik forbi, så han Levi, Alfæus's Søn sidde ved
      Toldboden, og han siger til ham: "Følg mig!" Og han stod op og
      fulgte ham.
 15.  Og det skete, at han sad til Bords i hans Hus, og mange Toldere
      og Syndere sade til Bords med Jesus, og hans Disciple; thi de
      vare mange. Og der fulgte også
 16.  nogle skriftkloge af Farisæerne med ham, og da de så, at han
      spiste med Toldere og Syndere, sagde de til hans Disciple: "Han
      spiser og drikker med Toldere og Syndere!"
 17.  Og da Jesus hørte det, siger han til dem: "De raske trænge ikke
      til Læge, men de syge. Jeg er ikke kommen for at kalde
      retfærdige, men Syndere."

 18.  Og Johannes's Disciple og Farisæerne fastede, og de komme og
      sige til ham: "Hvorfor faste Johannes's Disciple og Farisæernes
      Disciple, men dine Disciple faste ikke?"
 19.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "Kunne Brudesvendene faste, medens
      Brudgommen er hos dem? Så længe de have Brudgommen hos sig kunne
      de ikke faste.
 20.  Men der skal komme Dage, da Brudgommen bliver tagen fra dem, da
      skulle de faste på den Dag.
 21.  Ingen syr en Lap af uvalket Klæde på et gammelt Klædebon; ellers
      river den nye Lap på det gamle Klædebon dette itu, og der bliver
      et værre Hul.
 22.  Og ingen kommer ung Vin på gamle Læderflasker; ellers sprænger
      Vinen Læderflaskerne, og Vinen ødelægges såvel som
      Læderflaskerne; men kom ung Vin på nye Læderflasker!"

 23.  Og det skete, at han vandrede på Sabbaten igennem en Sædemark,
      og hans Disciple begyndte, imedens de gik, at plukke Aks.
 24.  Og Farisæerne sagde til ham: "Se, hvorfor gøre de på Sabbaten,
      hvad der ikke er tilladt?"
 25.  Og han siger til dem "Have I aldrig læst, hvad David gjorde, da
      han kom i Nød og blev hungrig, han selv og de, som vare med ham?
 26.  Hvorledes han gik ind i Guds Hus, da Abiathar var Ypperstepræst,
      og spiste Skuebrødene, som det ikke er nogen tilladt at spise
      uden Præsterne, og gav også dem, som vare med ham?"
 27.  Og han sagde til dem: "Sabbaten blev til for Menneskets Skyld og
      ikke Mennesket for Sabbatens Skyld.
 28.  Derfor er Menneskesønnen Herre også over Sabbaten."

Markus 3

  1.  Og han, gik atter ind i en Synagoge, og der var der en Mand, som
      havde en vissen Hånd.
  2.  Og de toge Vare på ham, om han vilde helbrede ham på Sabbaten,
      for at de kunde anklage ham.
  3.  Og han siger til Manden, som havde den visne Hånd!"Træd frem her
      i Midten!"
  4.  Og han siger til dem: "Er det tilladt at gøre godt på Sabbaten
      eller at gøre ondt, at frelse Liv eller at slå ihjel?" Men de
      tav.
  5.  Og han så omkring på dem med Vrede, bedrøvet over deres Hjertes
      Forhærdelse, og siger til Manden: "Ræk din Hånd ud!" og han
      rakte den ud, og hans Hånd blev sund igen.
  6.  Og Farisæerne gik straks ud og holdt Råd med Herodianerne imod
      ham, hvorledes de kunde slå ham ihjel.

  7.  Og Jesus drog med sine Disciple bort til Søen, og en stor Mængde
      fulgte med fra Galilæa; og fra Judæa
  8.  og fra Jerusalem og fra Idumæa og Landet hinsides Jordan og fra
      Egnen om Tyrus og Sidon kom de til ham i stor Mængde, da de
      hørte, hvor store Gerninger han gjorde.
  9.  Og han sagde til sine Disciple, at en Båd skulde være til Rede
      til ham for Skarens Skyld, for at de ikke skulde trænge ham.
 10.  Thi han helbredte mange, så at alle, som havde Plager, styrtede
      ind på ham for at røre ved ham.
 11.  Og når de urene Ånder så ham, faldt de ned for ham og råbte og
      sagde: "Du er Guds Søn."
 12.  Og han truede dem meget, at de ikke måtte gøre ham kendt.

 13.  Og han stiger op på Bjerget og hidkalder, hvem han selv vilde;
      og de gik hen til ham.
 14.  Og han beskikkede tolv, til at de skulde være hos ham, og til at
      han kunde udsende dem til at prædike
 15.  og at have Magt til at uddrive de onde Ånder.
 16.  Og han beskikkede de tolv, og han tillagde Simon Navnet Peter;
 17.  fremdeles Jakob, Zebedæus's Søn, og Johannes, Jakobs Broder, og
      han tillagde dem Navnet Boanerges, det er Tordensønner;
 18.  og Andreas og Filip og Bartholomæus og Matthæus og Thomas og
      Jakob, Alfæus's Søn, og Thaddæus og Simon Kananæeren
 19.  og Judas Iskariot, han, som forrådte ham.

 20.  Og han kommer hjem, og der samles atter en Skare, så at de end
      ikke kunne få Mad.
 21.  Og da hans nærmeste hørte det, gik de ud for at drage ham til
      sig thi de sagde: "Han er ude af sig selv."
 22.  Og de skriftkloge, som vare komne ned fra Jerusalem, sagde: "Han
      har Beelzebul, og ved de onde Ånders Fyrste uddriver han de onde
      Ånder:"
 23.  Og han kaldte dem til sig og sagde til dem i Lignelser:
      "Hvorledes kan Satan uddrive Satan?
 24.  Og dersom et Rige er kommet i Splid med sig selv, kan samme Rige
      ikke bestå.
 25.  Og dersom et Hus er kommet i Splid med sig selv, vil samme Hus
      ikke kunne bestå.
 26.  Og dersom Satan har sat sig op imod sig selv og er kommen i
      Splid med sig selv, kan han ikke bestå, men det er ude med ham.
 27.  Men ingen kan gå ind i den stærkes Hus og røve hans Ejendele,
      uden han først binder den stærke, og da kan han plyndre hans
      Hus.
 28.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, alle Ting skulle forlades Menneskenes
      Børn, Synder og Bespottelser, hvor store Bespottelser de end
      tale;
 29.  men den. som taler bespotteligt imod den Helligånd, har
      evindeligt ingen Forladelse, men skal være skyldig i en evig
      Synd."
 30.  De sagde nemlig: "Han har en uren Ånd."

 31.  Og hans Moder,og hans Brødre komme, og de stode udenfor og
      sendte Bud ind til ham og lode ham kalde.
 32.  Og en Skare sad omkring ham; og de sige til ham: "Se; din Moder
      og dine; Brødre og dine Søstre ere udenfor og spørge efter dig."
 33.  Og han svarer dem og siger: "Hvem er min Moder og mine Brødre?"
 34.  Og han så omkring på dem, som sade rundt om ham, og sagde: "Se,
      her er min Moder og mine Brødre!
 35.  Thi den, som gør Guds Villie, det er min Broder og Søster og
      Moder."

Markus 4

  1.  Og han begyndte atter at lære ved søen. Og en meget stor Skare
      samles om ham, så at han måtte gå om Bord og sætte sig i et Skib
      på Søen; og hele Skaren var på Land ved Søen.
  2.  Og han lærte dem meget i Lignelser og sagde til dem i sin
      Undervisning:
  3.  "Hører til: Se, en Sædemand gik ud at så.
  4.  Og det skete, idet han såede, at noget faldt ved Vejen, og
      Fuglene kom og åde det op.
  5.  Og noget faldt på Stengrund, hvor det ikke havde megen Jord; og
      det voksede straks op, fordi det ikke havde dyb Jord.
  6.  Og da Solen kom op, blev det svedet af, og fordi det ikke havde
      Rod, visnede det.
  7.  Og noget faldt iblandt Torne, og Tornene voksede op og kvalte
      det, og det bar ikke Frugt.
  8.  Og noget faldt i god Jord og bar Frugt, som skød frem og
      voksede, og det bar tredive og tresindstyve og hundrede Fold."
  9.  Og han sagde: "Den som har Øren at høre med, han høre!"

 10.  Og da han blev ene, spurgte de, som vare om ham, tillige med de
      tolv ham om Lignelserne.
 11.  Og han sagde til dem: "Eder er Guds Riges Hemmelighed givet; men
      dem, som ere udenfor, meddeles alt ved Lignelser,
 12.  for at de, skønt seende, skulle se og ikke indse og, skønt
      hørende, skulle høre og ikke forstå, for at de ikke skulle
      omvende sig og få Forladelse "

 13.  Og han siger til dem: "Fatte I ikke denne Lignelse? Hvorledes
      ville I da forstå alle de andre Lignelser?
 14.  Sædemanden sår Ordet.
 15.  Men de ved Vejen, det er dem, hvor Ordet bliver sået, og når de
      høre det, kommer straks Satan og borttager Ordet,som er sået i
      dem.
 16.  Og ligeledes de, som blive såede på Stengrunden, det er dem,
      som, når de høre Ordet, straks modtage det med Glæde;
 17.  og de have ikke Rod i sig, men holde kun ud til en Tid;
      derefter, når der kommer Trængsel eller forfølgelse for Ordets
      Skyld, forarges de straks.
 18.  Og andre ere de, som blive såede blandt Torne; det er dem, som
      have hørt Ordet
 19.  og denne Verdens Bekymringer og Rigdommens Forførelse og
      Begæringerne efter de andre Ting komme ind og kvæle Ordet, så
      det bliver uden Frugt.
 20.  Og de, der bleve såede i god Jord, det er dem, som høre Ordet og
      modtage det og bære Frugt,tredive og tresindstyve og hundrede
      Fold."

 21.  Og han sagde til dem: "Mon Lyset kommer ind for at sættes under
      Skæppen eller under, Bænken? Mon ikke for at sættes på
      Lysestagen?
 22.  Thi ikke er noget skjult uden for at åbenbares; ej heller er det
      blevet lønligt uden for at komme for Lyset.
 23.  Dersom nogen har Øren at høre med, han høre!"
 24.  Og han sagde til dem: "Agter på, hvad I høre! Med hvad Mål I
      måle, skal der tilmåles eder, og der skal gives eder end mere.
 25.  Thi den, som har, ham skal der gives; og den, som ikke har, fra
      ham skal endog det tages, som han har."

 26.  Og han sagde: "Med Guds Rige er det således, som når en Mand har
      lagt Sæden i Jorden
 27.  og sover og står op Nat og Dag, og Sæden spirer og bliver høj,
      han ved ej selv hvorledes.
 28.  Af sig selv bærer Jorden Frugt, først Strå, derefter Aks,
      derefter fuld Kærne i Akset;
 29.  men når Frugten er tjenlig, sender han straks Seglen ud; thi
      Høsten er for Hånden."

 30.  Og han sagde: "Hvormed skulle vi ligne Guds Rige, eller under
      hvilken Lignelse skulle vi fremstille det?
 31.  Det er som et Sennepskorn, som, når det sås i Jorden, er mindre
      end alt andet Frø på Jorden,
 32.  og når det er sået, vokser det op og bliver større end alle
      Urterne og skyder store Grene, så at Himmelens Fugle kunne bygge
      Rede i dets Skygge."
 33.  Og i mange sådanne Lignelser talte han Ordet til dem, efter som
      de kunde fatte det.
 34.  Men uden Lignelse talte han ikke til dem; men i Enerum udlagde
      han det alt sammen for sine Disciple.

 35.  Og på den Dag, da det var blevet Aften, siger han til dem:
      "Lader os fare over til hin Side!"
 36.  Og de forlade Folkeskaren og tage ham med, som ham sad i Skibet;
      men der var også andre Skibe med ham.
 37.  Og der kommer en stærk Stormvind, og Bølgerne sloge ind i
      Skibet, så at Skibet allerede var ved at fyldes.
 38.  Og han var i Bagstavnen og sov på en Hovedpude, og de vække ham
      og sige til ham: "Mester! bryder du dig ikke om, at vi forgå?"
 39.  Og han stod op og truede Vinden og sagde til Søen: "Ti, vær
      stille!" og Vinden lagde sig, og det blev ganske blikstille.
 40.  Og han sagde til dem: "Hvorfor ere I så bange? Hvorfor have I
      ikke Tro?"
 41.  Og de frygtede såre og sagde til hverandre: "Hvem er dog denne
      siden både Vinden og Søen ere ham lydige?"

Markus 5

  1.  Og de kom over til hin Side af Søen til Gerasenernes Land.
  2.  Og da han trådte ud af Skibet, kom der ham straks i Møde ud fra
      Gravene en Mand med en uren Ånd.
  3.  Han havde sin Bolig i Gravene, og ingen kunde længer binde ham,
      end ikke med Lænker.
  4.  Thi han havde ofte været bunden med Bøjer og Lænker, og Lænkerne
      vare sprængte af ham og Bøjerne sønderslidte, og ingen kunde
      tæmme ham.
  5.  Og han var altid Nat og Dag i Gravene og på Bjergene, skreg og
      slog sig selv med Sten.
  6.  Men da han så Jesus. Langt borte, løb han hen og kastede sig ned
      for ham
  7.  og råbte med høj Røst og sagde: "Hvad har jeg med dig at gøre,
      Jesus, den højeste Guds Søn? Jeg besvæger dig ved Gud, at du
      ikke piner mig."
  8.  Thi han sagde til ham: "Far ud af Manden, du urene Ånd!"
  9.  Og han spurgte ham: "Hvad er dit Navn?" Og han siger til ham:
      "Legion er mit Navn; thi vi ere mange."
 10.  Og han bad ham meget om ikke at drive dem ud af Landet.
 11.  Men der var der ved Bjerget en stor Hjord Svin, som græssede;
 12.  og de bade ham og sagde: "Send os i Svinene, så vi må fare i
      dem."
 13.  Og han tilstedte dem det. Og de urene Ånder fore ud og fore i
      Svinene; og Hjorden styrtede sig ned over Brinken ud i Søen,
      omtrent to Tusinde, og de druknede i Søen
 14.  Og deres Hyrder flyede og forkyndte det i Byen og på Landet; og
      de kom for at se, hvad det var, som var sket.
 15.  Og de komme til Jesus og se den besatte, ham, som havde haft
      Legionen, sidde påklædt og ved Samling, og de frygtede.
 16.  Men de, som havde set det, fortalte dem, hvorledes det var gået
      den besatte, og om Svinene.
 17.  Og de begyndte at bede ham om, at han vilde gå bort fra deres
      Egn.
 18.  Og da han gik om Bord i Skibet, bad den, som havde været besat,
      ham om, at han måtte være hos ham.
 19.  Og han tilstedte ham det ikke, men siger til ham: "Gå til dit
      Hus, til dine egne, og forkynd dem, hvor store Ting Herren har
      gjort imod dig, og at han har forbarmet sig over dig."
 20.  Og han gik bort og begyndte at kundgøre i Bekapolis, hvor store
      Ting Jesus havde gjort imod ham; og alle undrede sig.

 21.  Og da Jesus igen i Skibet var faren over til hin Side, samledes
      der en stor Skare om ham, og han var ved Søen.
 22.  Og der kommer en af Synagogeforstanderne ved Navn Jairus, og da
      han ser ham, falder han ned for hans Fødder.
 23.  Og han beder ham meget og siger: "Min lille Datter er på sit
      yderste; o! at du vilde komme og lægge Hænderne på hende, for at
      hun må frelses og leve!"
 24.  Og han gik bort med ham, og en stor Skare fulgte ham, og de
      trængte ham.
 25.  Og der var en Kvinde, som havde haft Blodflod i tolv År,
 26.  og hun havde døjet meget af mange Læger og havde tilsat alt,
      hvad hun ejede, og hun var ikke bleven hjulpen, men tværtimod,
      det var blevet værre med hende.
 27.  Da hun havde hørt om Jesus, kom hun bagfra i Skaren og rørte ved
      hans Klædebon.
 28.  Thi hun sagde: "Dersom jeg rører blot ved hans Klæder, bliver
      jeg frelst."
 29.  Og straks tørredes hendes Blods Kilde, og hun mærkede i sit
      Legeme, at hun var bleven helbredt fra sin Plage.
 30.  Og straks da Jesus mærkede på sig selv, at den Kraft var udgået
      fra ham, vendte han sig om i Skaren og sagde: "Hvem rørte ved
      mine Klæder?"
 31.  Og hans Disciple sagde til ham: "Du ser, at Skaren trænger dig,
      og du siger: Hvem rørte ved mig?"
 32.  Og han så sig om for at se hende, som havde gjort dette.
 33.  Men da Kvinden vidste, hvad der var sket hende, kom hun
      frygtende og bævende og faldt ned for ham og sagde ham hele
      Sandheden.
 34.  Men han sagde til hende: "Datter! din Tro har frelst dig; gå
      bort med Fred, og vær helbredt fra din Plage!"
 35.  Endnu medens han talte, komme nogle fra Synagogeforstanderens
      Hus og sige: "Din Datter er død, hvorfor umager du Mesteren
      længere?"
 36.  Men Jesus hørte det Ord, som blev sagt, og han siger til
      Synagogeforstanderen: "Frygt ikke, tro blot!"
 37.  Og han tilstedte ingen at følge med sig uden Peter og Jakob og
      Johannes, Jakobs Broder.
 38.  Og de komme ind i Synagogeforstanderens Hus, og han ser en
      larmende Hob, der græd og hylede meget.
 39.  Og han går ind og siger til dem: "Hvorfor larme og græde I?
      Barnet er ikke død, men det sover."
 40.  Og de lo ad ham; men han drev dem alle ud, og han tager Barnets
      Fader og Moder og sine Ledsagere med sig og går ind, hvor Barnet
      var.
 41.  Og han tager Barnet ved Hånden og siger til hende: "Talitha
      kumi!" hvilket er udlagt: "Pige, jeg siger dig, stå op!"
 42.  Og straks stod Pigen op og gik omkring; thi hun var tolv År
      gammel. Og de bleve straks overmåde forfærdede
 43.  Og han bød dem meget, at ingen måtte få dette at vide; og han
      sagde, at de skulde give hende noget at spise.

Markus 6

  1.  Og han gik bort derfra Og han kommer til sin Fædreneby, og hans
      Disciple følge ham.
  2.  Og da det blev Sabbat, begyndte han at lære i Synagogen, og de
      mange, som hørte ham, bleve slagne af Forundring og sagde:
      "Hvorfra har han dog dette, og hvad er det for en Visdom, som er
      given ham,og hvilke kraftige Gerninger der dog sker ved hans
      Hænder!
  3.  Er denne ikke Tømmermanden, Marias Søn og Jakobs og Joses's og
      Judas's og Simons Broder? Og ere ikke hans Søstre her hos os?"
      Og de forargedes på ham.
  4.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "En Profet er ikke foragtet uden i sit
      eget Fædreland og iblandt sine Slægtninge og i sit Hus."
  5.  Og han kunde ikke gøre nogen kraftig Gerning der; kun lagde han
      Hænderne på nogle få syge og helbredte dem
  6.  Og han forundrede sig over deres Vantro. Og han gik om i
      Landsbyerne der omkring og lærte.

  7.  Og han hidkalder de tolv, og han begyndte at udsende dem, to og
      to, og gav dem Magt over de urene Ånder.
  8.  Og han bød dem, at de skulde intet tage med på Vejen uden en
      Stav alene, ikke Brød, ikke Taske, ikke Kobber i Bæltet,
  9.  men have Sko på og: "Ifører eder ikke to Kjortler!"
 10.  Og han sagde til dem: "Hvor I komme ind i et Hus, der skulle I
      blive, indtil I drage bort fra Stedet.
 11.  Og hvor man ikke vil modtage eder og ikke vil høre eder, der
      skulle I gå bort fra og afryste Støvet under eders Fødder til
      Vidnesbyrd imod dem."
 12.  Og de gik ud og prædikede, at man skulde omvende sig.
 13.  Og de dreve onde Ånder ud og salvede mange syge med Olie og
      helbredte dem.

 14.  Og Kong Herodes hørte det (thi hans Navn var blevet bekendt), og
      han sagde: "Johannes Døberen er oprejst fra de døde, og derfor
      virke Kræfterne i ham."
 15.  Andre sagde: "Det er Elias; " men andre sagde: "Det er en Profet
      ligesom en af Profeterne."
 16.  Men da Herodes hørte det, sagde han: "Johannes, som jeg har
      ladet halshugge, han er oprejst."
 17.  Thi Herodes havde selv sendt Bud og ladet Johannes gribe og
      kaste i Fængsel for sin Broder Filips Hustru, Herodias's Skyld;
      thi han havde taget hende til Ægte.
 18.  Johannes sagde nemlig til Herodes: "Det er dig ikke tilladt at
      have din Broders Hustru."
 19.  Men Herodias bar Nag til ham og vilde gerne slå ham ihjel, og
      hun kunde det ikke.
 20.  Thi Herodes frygtede for Johannes, fordi han vidste, at han var
      en retfærdig og hellig Mand, og han holdt sin Hånd over ham; og
      når han hørte ham, var han tvivlrådig om mange Ting, og han
      hørte ham gerne.
 21.  Og da der kom en belejlig Dag, da Herodes på sin Fødselsdag
      gjorde et Gæstebud for sine Stormænd og Krigsøversterne og de
      ypperste i Galilæa,
 22.  og da selve Herodias's Datter kom ind og dansede, behagede hun
      Herodes og Gæsterne. Og Kongen sagde til Pigen: "Bed mig, om
      hvad som helst du vil, så vil jeg give dig det."
 23.  Og han svor hende til og sagde: "Hvad som helst du beder om, vil
      jeg give dig, indtil Halvdelen af mit Rige."
 24.  Og hun gik ud og sagde til sin Moder: "Hvad skal jeg bede om?"
      Men hun sagde: "Om Johannes Døberens Hoved."
 25.  Og hun gik straks skyndsomt ind til Kongen, bad og sagde: "Jeg
      vil, at du straks giver mig Johannes Døberens Hoved på et Fad."
 26.  Om end Kongen blev meget bedrøvet, vilde han dog for Edernes og
      Gæsternes Skyld ikke afvise hende:
 27.  Og Kongen sendte straks en at Vagten og befalede at bringe hans
      Hoved
 28.  Og denne gik hen og halshuggede ham i Fængselet; og han bragte
      hans Hoved på et Fad og gav det til Pigen, og Pigen gav det til
      sin Moder.
 29.  Og da hans Disciple hørte det, kom de og toge hans Lig og lagde
      det i en Grav.

 30.  Og Apostlene samle sig om Jesus, og de forkyndte ham alt, hvad
      de havde gjort, og hvad de havde lært.
 31.  Og han siger til dem: "Kommer nu I med afsides til et øde Sted
      og hviler eder lidt;" thi der var mange, som gik til og fra, og
      de havde ikke engang Ro til at spise.
 32.  Og de droge bort i Skibet til et øde Sted afsides.
 33.  Og man så dem drage bort, og mange kendte dem, og til Fods
      strømmede de sammen derhen fra alle Byerne og kom før end de.
 34.  Og da han gik i Land, så han en stor Skare, og han ynkedes
      inderligt over dem; thi de vare som Får, der ikke have Hyrde; og
      han begyndte at lære dem meget.
 35.  Og da Tiden allerede var fremrykket, kom hans Disciple til ham
      og sagde: "Stedet er øde, og Tiden er allerede fremrykket.
 36.  Lad dem gå bort, for at de kunne gå hen i de omliggende Gårde og
      Landsbyer og købe sig noget at spise."
 37.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Giver I dem at spise!" Og de
      sige til ham: "Skulle vi gå hen og købe Brød for to Hundrede
      Denarer og give dem at spise?"
 38.  Men han siger til dem: "Hvor mange Brød have I? Går hen og ser
      efter!" Og da de havde fået det at vide, sige de: "Fem, og to
      Fisk."
 39.  Og han bød dem at lade dem alle sætte sig ned i små Flokke i det
      grønne Græs.
 40.  Og de satte sig ned, Hob ved Hob, somme på hundrede og somme på
      halvtredsindstyve.
 41.  Og han tog de fem Brød og de to Fisk, så op til Himmelen og
      velsignede; og han brød Brødene og gav sine Disciple dem at
      lægge for dem, og han delte de to Fisk til dem alle.
 42.  Og de spiste alle og bleve mætte.
 43.  Og de optoge tolv Kurve fulde af Stykker, også af Fiskene.
 44.  Og de, som spiste Brødene, vare fem Tusinde Mænd.

 45.  Og straks nødte han sine Disciple til at gå om Bord i Skibet og
      i Forvejen sætte over til hin Side, til Bethsajda, medens han
      selv lod Skaren gå bort.
 46.  Og da han havde taget Afsked med dem, gik han op på Bjerget for
      at bede.
 47.  Og da det var blevet silde, var Skibet midt på Søen og han alene
      på Landjorden.
 48.  Og da han så, at de havde deres Nød med at ro (thi Vinden var
      dem imod); kommer han ved den fjerde Nattevagt til dem vandrende
      på Søen. Og han vilde gå dem forbi.
 49.  Men da de så ham vandre på Søen, mente de, at det var et
      Spøgelse, og de skrege.
 50.  Thi de så ham alle og bleve forfærdede. Men han talte straks med
      dem og sagde til dem: "Værer frimodige, det er mig, frygter
      ikke!"
 51.  Og han steg op i Skibet til dem, og Vinden lagde sig, og de
      forfærdedes over al Måde ved sig selv.
 52.  Thi de havde ikke fået Forstand af det, som var sket med
      Brødene; men deres Hjerte var forhærdet

 53.  Og da de vare farne over til Landet, kom de til Genezareth og
      lagde til der.
 54.  Og da de trådte ud af Skibet, kendte man ham straks.
 55.  Og de løb om i hele den Egn og begyndte at bringe de syge på
      deres Senge omkring, hvor de hørte, at han var.
 56.  Og hvor som helst han gik ind i Landsbyer eller Byer eller
      Gårde, lagde de de syge på Torvene og bade ham om, at de måtte
      røre blot ved Fligen af hans Klædebon; og alle de, som rørte ved
      ham, bleve helbredte.

Markus 7

  1.  Og Farisæerne og nogle af de skriftkloge, som vare komne fra
      Jerusalem, samle sig om ham.
  2.  Og da de så nogle af hans Disciple holde Måltid med vanhellige,
      det er utoede, Hænder
  3.  thi Farisæerne og alle Jøderne spise ikke uden at to Hænderne
      omhyggeligt, idet de fastholde de gamles Overlevering;
  4.  og når de komme fra Torvet, spise de ikke uden først at tvætte
      sig; og der er mange andre Ting, som de have vedtaget at holde,
      Tvætninger af Bægere og Krus og Kobberkar og Bænke,
  5.  så spurgte Farisæerne og de skriftkloge ham ad: "Hvorfor vandre
      dine Disciple ikke efter de gamles Overlevering, men holde
      Måltid med vanhellige Hænder?"
  6.  Men han sagde til dem: "Rettelig profeterede Esajas om eder, I
      Hyklere! som der er skrevet: "Dette Folk ærer mig med Læberne,
      men deres Hjerte er langt borte fra mig.
  7.  Men de dyrke mig forgæves, idet de lære Lærdomme, som ere
      Menneskers Bud."
  8.  I forlade Guds Bud og holde Menneskers Overlevering."
  9.  Og han sagde til dem: "Smukt ophæve I Guds Bud, for at I kunne
      holde eders Overlevering.
 10.  Thi Moses har sagt: "Ær din Fader og din Moder"; og:"Den, som
      hader Fader eller Moder, skal visselig dø".
 11.  Men I sige: Når en Mand siger til sin Fader eller sin Moder:
      "Det, hvormed du skulde være hjulpen af mig, skal være Korban
      (det er: Tempelgave),"
 12.  da tilstede I ham ikke mere at gøre noget for sin Fader eller
      Moder,
 13.  idet I ophæve Guds Ord ved eders Overlevering, som I have
      overleveret; og mange lignende Ting gøre I."
 14.  Og han kaldte atter Folkeskaren til sig og sagde til dem: "Hører
      mig alle, og forstår!
 15.  Der er intet uden for Mennesket, som, når det går ind i ham, kan
      gøre ham uren; men hvad der går ud af Mennesket, det er det, som
      gør Mennesket urent.
 16.  Dersom nogen har Øren at høre med, han høre!"
 17.  Og da han var gået ind i Huset og var borte fra Skaren, spurgte
      hans Disciple ham om Lignelsen.
 18.  Og han siger til dem: "Ere også I så uforstandige? Forstå I
      ikke, at intet, som udefra går ind i Mennesket, kan gøre ham
      uren?
 19.  Thi det går ikke ind i hans Hjerte men i hans Bug og går ud ad
      den naturlige Vej, og således renses al Maden."
 20.  Men han sagde: "Det, som går ud af Mennesket, dette gør
      Mennesket urent.
 21.  Thi indvortes fra, fra Menneskenes Hjerte, udgå de onde Tanker,
      Utugt, Tyveri, Mord,
 22.  Hor, Havesyge, Ondskab, Svig, Uterlighed, et ondt Øje,
      Forhånelse, Hovmod, Fremfusenhed;
 23.  alle disse onde Ting udgå indvortes fra og gøre Mennesket
      urent."

 24.  Og han stod op og gik bort derfra til Tyrus's og Sidons Egne. Og
      han gik ind i et Hus og vilde ikke, at nogen skulde vide det. Og
      han kunde dog ikke være skjult;
 25.  men en Kvinde, hvis lille Datter havde en uren Ånd, havde hørt
      om ham og kom straks ind og faldt ned for hans Fødder;
 26.  (men Kvinden var græsk, af Herkomst en Syrofønikerinde), og hun
      bad ham om, at han vilde uddrive den onde Ånd af hendes Datter.
 27.  Og han sagde til hende: "Lad først Børnene mættes; thi det er
      ikke smukt at tage Børnenes Brød og kaste det for de små Hunde."
 28.  Men hun svarede og siger til ham: "Jo, Herre! også de små Hunde
      æde under Bordet af Børnenes Smuler."
 29.  Og han sagde til hende: "For dette Ords Skyld gå bort; den onde
      Ånd er udfaren af din Datter"
 30.  Og hun gik bort til sit Hus og fandt Barnet liggende på Sengen
      og den onde Ånd udfaren.

 31.  Og da han gik bort igen fra Tyrus's Egne, kom han over Sidon
      midt igennem Dekapolis's Egne til Galilæas Sø.
 32.  Og de bringe ham en døv, som også vanskeligt kunde tale, og bede
      ham om, at han vilde lægge Hånden på ham.
 33.  Og han tog ham afsides fra Skaren og lagde sine Fingre i hans
      Øren og spyttede og rørte ved hans Tunge
 34.  og så op til Himmelen, sukkede og sagde til ham: "Effata!" det
      er: lad dig op!
 35.  Og hans Øren åbnedes, og straks løstes hans Tunges Bånd, og han
      talte ret.
 36.  Og han bød dem, at de ikke måtte sige det til nogen; men jo mere
      han bød dem, desto mere kundgjorde de det.
 37.  Og de bleve over al Måde slagne af Forundring og sagde: "Han har
      gjort alle Ting vel; både gør han, at de døve høre, og at
      målløse tale."

Markus 8

  1.  I de Dage da der atter var en stor Skare, og de intet havde at
      spise, kaldte han sine Disciple til sig og siger til dem:
  2.  "Jeg ynkes inderligt over Skaren; thi de have allerede tøvet hos
      mig i tre Dage og have intet at spise.
  3.  Og dersom jeg lader dem gå fastende hjem, ville de vansmægte på
      Vejen, og nogle af dem ere komne langvejsfra."
  4.  Og hans Disciple svarede ham: "Hvorfra skal nogen kunne mætte
      disse med Brød her i en Ørken?"
  5.  Og han spurgte dem: "Hvor mange Brød have I?" Og de sagde:"Syv."
  6.  Og han byder Skaren af sætte sig ned på Jorden; og han tog de
      syv Brød, takkede, brød, dem og gav sine Disciple dem, at de
      skulde lægge dem for; og de lagde dem for Skaren.
  7.  Og de havde nogle få Småfisk; og han velsignede dem og sagde, af
      også disse skulde lægges for.
  8.  Og de spiste og bleve mætte; og de opsamlede af tiloversblevne
      Stykker syv Kurve.
  9.  Men de vare omtrent fire Tusinde; og han lod dem gå bort.

 10.  Og straks gik han om Bord i Skibet med sine Disciple og kom til
      Dalmanuthas Egne.
 11.  Og Farisæerne gik ud og begyndte at strides med ham og forlangte
      af ham et Tegn fra Himmelen for at friste ham.
 12.  Og han sukkede dybt i sin Ånd og siger: "Hvorfor forlanger denne
      Slægt et Tegn? Sandelig, siger jeg eder, der skal ikke gives
      denne Slægt noget Tegn!"
 13.  Og han forlod dem og gik atter om Bord og for over til hin Side.

 14.  Og de havde glemt at tage Brød med og havde kun eet Brød med sig
      i Skibet.
 15.  Og han bød dem og sagde: "Ser til, tager eder i Vare for
      Farisæernes Surdejg og Herodes's Surdejg!"
 16.  Og de tænkte med hverandre: "Det er, fordi vi ikke have Brød."
 17.  Og da han mærkede dette, siger han til dem: "Hvorfor tænke I på,
      at I ikke have Brød? Skønne I ikke endnu, og forstå I ikke? Er
      eders Hjerte forhærdet?
 18.  Have I Øjne og se ikke? Og have I Øren og høre ikke? Og komme I
      ikke i Hu?
 19.  Da jeg brød de fem Brød til de fem Tusinde, hvor mange Kurve
      fulde af Stykker toge I da op?" De sige til ham: "Tolv."
 20.  "Og da jeg brød de syv til de fire Tusinde, hvor mange Kurve
      fulde af Stykker toge I da op?" Og de sige til ham: "Syv."
 21.  Og han sagde til dem "Hvorledes forstå I da ikke?"

 22.  Og de komme til Bethsajda. Og man fører en blind til ham og
      beder ham om, at han vil røre ved ham.
 23.  Og han tog den blinde ved Hånden og førte ham uden for Landsbyen
      og spyttede på hans Øjne og lagde Hænderne på ham og spurgte
      ham, om han så noget.
 24.  Og han så op og sagde: "Jeg ser Menneskene; thi jeg ser noget
      ligesom Træer gå omkring."
 25.  Derefter lagde han atter Hænderne på hans Øjne, og han blev
      klarsynet og var helbredt og kunde se alle Ting tydeligt.
 26.  Og han sendte ham hjem og sagde: "Du må ikke gå ind i Landsbyen,
      ej heller sige det til nogen i Landsbyen."

 27.  Og Jesus og hans Disciple gik ud til Landsbyerne ved Kæsarea
      Filippi; og på Vejen spurgte han sine Disciple og sagde til dem:
      "Hvem sige Menneskene, at jeg er?"
 28.  Og de sagde til ham: "Johannes Døberen; og andre: Elias; men
      andre: en af Profeterne."
 29.  Og han spurgte dem: "Men I, hvem sige I, at jeg er?" Peter
      svarede og siger til ham: "Du er Kristus."
 30.  Og han bød dem strengt,at de ikke måtte sige nogen dette om ham.

 31.  Og han begyndte at lære dem, at Menneskesønnen skulde lide meget
      og forkastes af de Ældste og Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge
      og ihjelslås og opstå efter tre Dage.
 32.  Og han talte dette frit ud. Og Peter tog ham til Side og
      begyndte at sætte ham i Rette.
 33.  Men han vendte sig og så på sine Disciple og irettesatte Peter
      og siger: "Vig bag mig, Satan! thi du sanser ikke, hvad Guds er,
      men hvad Menneskers er."

 34.  Og han kaldte Skaren tillige med sine Disciple til sig og sagde
      til dem: "Den, som vil følge efter mig, han fornægte sig selv og
      tage sit Kors op og følge mig!
 35.  Thi den, som vil frelse sit Liv, skal miste det; men den, som
      mister sit Liv for min og Evangeliets Skyld, han skal frelse
      det.
 36.  Thi hvad gavner det et Menneske at vinde den hele Verden og at
      bøde med sin Sjæl?
 37.  Thi hvad kunde et Menneske give til Vederlag for sin Sjæl?
 38.  Thi den, som skammer sig ved mig og mine Ord i denne utro og
      syndige Slægt, ved ham skal også Menneskesønnen skamme sig, når
      han kommer i sin Faders Herlighed med de hellige Engle."
      (Kap. 9.) 1 Og han sagde til dem: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, der
      er nogle af dem, som stå her, der ingenlunde skulle smage Døden,
      førend de se Guds Rige være kommet med Kraft."

Markus 9
  2.  Og seks Dage derefter tager Jesus Peter og Jakob og Johannes med
      sig og fører dem alene afsides op på et højt Bjerg, og han blev
      forvandlet for deres Øjne.
  3.  Og hans Klæder bleve skinnende, meget hvide, så at ingen
      Blegemand på Jorden kan gøre Klæder så hvide.
  4.  Og Elias tillige med Moses viste sig for dem, og de samtalede
      med Jesus.
  5.  Og Peter tog til Orde og siger til Jesus: "Rabbi! det er godt,
      at vi ere her, og lader os gøre tre Hytter, dig en og Moses en
      og Elias en."
  6.  Thi han vidste ikke, hvad han skulde sige; thi de vare blevne
      helt forfærdede.
  7.  Og der kom en Sky, som overskyggede dem; og en Røst kom fra
      Skyen: "Denne er min Søn, den elskede, hører ham!"
  8.  Og pludseligt, da de så sig om, så de ingen mere uden Jesus
      alene hos dem.
  9.  Og da de gik ned fra Bjerget, bød han dem, at de ikke måtte
      fortælle nogen, hvad de havde set, førend Menneskesønnen var
      opstanden fra de døde.
 10.  Og de fastholdt dette Ord hos sig selv og spurgte hverandre,
      hvad det er at opstå fra de døde.

 11.  Og de spurgte ham og sagde: "De skriftkloge sige jo, at Elias
      bør først komme?"
 12.  Men han sagde til dem: "Elias kommer først og genopretter
      alting; og hvorledes er der skrevet om Menneskesønnen? At han
      skal lide meget og foragtes.
 13.  Men jeg siger eder, at både er Elias kommen, og de gjorde ved
      ham alt, hvad de vilde, efter som der er skrevet om ham."

 14.  Og da de kom til Disciplene, så de en stor Skare omkring dem og
      skriftkloge, som tvistedes med dem.
 15.  Og straks studsede hele Skaren, da de så ham, og de løb hen og
      hilsede ham.
 16.  Og han spurgte dem: "Hvorom tvistes I med dem?"
 17.  Og en af Skaren svarede ham: "Mester! jeg har bragt min Søn til
      dig; han har en målløs Ånd.
 18.  Og hvor som helst den griber ham, slider den i ham, og han
      fråder og skærer Tænder, og han visner hen; og jeg har sagt til
      dine Disciple, at de skulde uddrive den, og de kunde ikke."
 19.  Men han svarede dem og sagde: "O du vantro Slægt! hvor længe
      skal jeg være hos eder, hvor længe skal jeg tåle eder? Bringer
      ham til mig!"
 20.  Og de ledte ham frem til ham; og da han så ham, sled Ånden
      straks i ham, og han faldt om på Jorden og væltede sig og
      fraadede.
 21.  Og han spurgte hans Fader: "Hvor længe er det siden, at dette er
      kommet over ham?" Men han sagde: "Fra Barndommen af;
 22.  og den har ofte kastet ham både i Ild og i Vand for at ødelægge
      ham; men om du formår noget, da forbarm dig over os, og hjælp
      os!"
 23.  Men Jesus sagde til ham: "Om du formår! Alle Ting ere mulige for
      den, som tror."
 24.  Straks råbte Barnets Fader og sagde med Tårer: "Jeg tror, hjælp
      min Vantro!"
 25.  Men da Jesus så, at Skaren stimlede sammen, truede han den urene
      Ånd og sagde til den: "Du målløse og døve Ånd! jeg byder dig,
      far ud af ham, og far ikke mere ind i ham!"
 26.  Da skreg og sled den meget i ham og for ud, og han blev ligesom
      død, så at de fleste sagde: "Han er død."
 27.  Men Jesus tog ham ved Hånden og rejste ham op; og han stod op.
 28.  Og da han var kommen ind i et Hus, spurgte hans Disciple ham i
      Enrum: "Hvorfor kunde vi ikke uddrive den?"
 29.  Og han sagde til dem: "Denne Slags kan ikke fare ud ved noget,
      uden ved Bøn og Faste."

 30.  Og da de gik ud derfra, vandrede de igennem Galilæa; og han
      vilde ikke, at nogen skulde vide det.
 31.  Thi han lærte sine Disciple og sagde til dem: "Menneskesønnen
      overgives i Menneskers Hænder, og de skulle slå ham ihjel; og
      når han er ihjelslået, skal han opstå tre Dage efter."
 32.  Men de forstode ikke det Ord og frygtede for at spørge ham.

 33.  Og de kom til Kapernaum, og da han var kommen ind i Huset,
      spurgte han dem: "Hvad var det, I overvejede med hverandre på
      Vejen?"
 34.  Men de tav; thi de havde talt med hverandre på Vejen om, hvem
      der var den største.
 35.  Og han satte sig og kaldte på de tolv og siger til dem: "Dersom
      nogen vil være den første, han skal være den sidste af alle og
      alles Tjener."
 36.  Og han tog et lille Barn og stillede det midt iblandt dem og tog
      det i Favn og sagde til dem:
 37.  "Den, som modtager eet af disse små Børn for mit Navns Skyld,
      modtager mig; og den, som modtager mig, modtager ikke mig, men
      den, som udsendte mig."

 38.  Johannes sagde til ham: "Mester! vi så en, som ikke følger os,
      uddrive onde Ånder i dit Navn; og vi forbød ham det, fordi han
      ikke følger os."
 39.  Men Jesus sagde: "Forbyder ham det ikke; thi der er ingen, som
      gør en kraftig Gerning i mit Navn og snart efter kan tale ilde
      om mig.
 40.  Thi den, som ikke er imod os, er for os.
 41.  Thi den, som giver eder et Bæger Vand at drikke i mit Navn,
      fordi I høre Kristus til, sandelig, siger jeg eder, han skal
      ingenlunde miste sin Løn

 42.  Og den, som forarger en af disse små, som tro, for ham var det
      bedre, at der lå en Møllesten om hans Hals, og han var kastet i
      Havet.
 43.  Og dersom din Hånd forarger dig, så hug den af; det er bedre for
      dig at gå som en Krøbling ind til Livet end at have to Hænder og
      fare til Helvede til den uudslukkelige Ild,
 44.  hvor deres Orm ikke dør, og Ilden ikke udslukkes.
 45.  Og dersom din Fod forarger dig, så hug den af; det er bedre for
      dig at gå lam ind til Livet end at have to Fødder og blive
      kastet i Helvede,
 46.  hvor deres Orm ikke dør, og Ilden ikke udslukkes.
 47.  Og dersom dit Øje forarger dig, så riv det ud; det er bedre for
      dig at gå enøjet ind i Guds Rige end at have to Øjne og blive
      kastet i Helvede,
 48.  hvor deres Orm ikke dør, og Ilden ikke udslukkes.
 49.  Thi enhver skal saltes med Ild, og alt Offer skal saltes med
      Salt.)
 50.  Saltet er godt; men dersom Saltet bliver saltløst, hvormed ville
      I da give det sin Kraft igen? Haver Salt i eder selv, og holder
      Fred med hverandre!"

Markus 10

  1.  Og han bryder op derfra og kommer til Judæas Egne og Landet
      hinsides Jordan, og atter samler der sig Skarer om ham; og han
      lærte dem atter, som han plejede.
  2.  Og Farisæerne kom hen og spurgte ham for at friste ham: "Er det
      en Mand tilladt at skille sig fra sin Hustru?"
  3.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Hvad har Moses budt eder?"
  4.  Men de sagde: "Moses tilstedte at skrive et Skilsmissebrev og
      skille sig fra hende."
  5.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "For eders Hjerters Hårdheds Skyld skrev
      han eder dette Bud.
  6.  Men fra Skabningens Begyndelse skabte Gud dem som Mand og
      Kvinde.
  7.  Derfor skal en Mand forlade sin Fader og Moder, og holde fast
      ved sin Hustru;
  8.  og de to skulle blive til eet Kød. Således ere de ikke længer
      to, men eet Kød.
  9.  Derfor, hvad Gud har sammenføjet, må et Menneske ikke adskille.
 10.  Og i Huset spurgte Disciplene ham atter om dette.
 11.  Og han siger til dem: "Den, som skiller sig fra sin Hustru og
      tager en anden til Ægte, han bedriver Hor imod hende.
 12.  Og dersom hun efter at have skilt sig fra sin Mand ægter en
      anden, bedriver hun Hor."

 13.  Og de bare små Børn til ham, for at han skulde røre ved dem; men
      Disciplene truede dem, som bare dem frem.
 14.  Men da Jesus så det, blev han vred og sagde til dem: "Lader de
      små Børn komme til mig; formener dem det ikke, thi Guds Rige
      hører sådanne til.
 15.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, den, som ikke modtager Guds Rige
      ligesom et lille Barn, han skal ingenlunde komme ind i det."
 16.  Og han tog dem i Favn og lagde Hænderne på dem og velsignede
      dem.

 17.  Og da han gik ud på Vejen, løb en hen og faldt på Knæ for ham og
      spurgte ham: "Gode Mester! hvad skal jeg gøre, for at jeg kan
      arve et evigt Liv?"
 18.  Men Jesus sagde til ham: "Hvorfor kalder du mig god? Ingen er
      god, uden een, nemlig Gud.
 19.  Du kender Budene: Du må ikke bedrive Hor; du må ikke slå ihjel;
      du må ikke stjæle; du må ikke sige falsk Vidnesbyrd; du må ikke
      besvige; ær din Fader og din Moder."
 20.  Men han sagde til ham: "Mester! det har jeg holdt alt sammen fra
      min Ungdom af."
 21.  Men Jesus så på ham og fattede Kærlighed til ham og sagde til
      ham: "Een Ting fattes dig; gå bort, sælg alt, hvad du har, og
      giv det til de fattige, så skal du have en Skat i Himmelen; og
      kom så og følg mig!"
 22.  Men han blev ilde til Mode over den Tale og gik bedrøvet bort;
      thi han havde meget Gods.
 23.  Og Jesus så sig omkring og siger til sine Disciple: "Hvor
      vanskeligt komme de, som have Rigdom, ind i Guds Rige!"
 24.  Men Disciplene bleve forfærdede over hans Ord. Men Jesus tog
      atter, til Orde og siger til dem: "Børn, hvor vanskeligt er det,
      at de som forlade sig på Rigdom, kunne komme ind i Guds Rige!
 25.  Det er lettere for en Kamel at gå igennem et Nåleøje end for en
      rig at gå ind i Guds Rige."
 26.  Men de forfærdedes overmåde og sagde til hverandre: "Hvem kan da
      blive frelst?"
 27.  Jesus så på dem og siger: "For Mennesker er det umuligt, men
      ikke for Gud; thi alle Ting ere mulige for Gud."

 28.  Peter tog til Orde og sagde til ham: "Se, vi have forladt alle
      Ting og fulgt dig."
 29.  Jesus sagde: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, der er ingen, som har
      forladt Hus eller Brødre eller Søstre eller Moder eller Fader
      eller Børn eller Marker for min og for Evangeliets Skyld,
 30.  uden at han jo skal få hundrede Fold igen, nu i denne Tid Huse
      og Brødre og Søstre og Mødre og Børn og Marker tillige med
      Forfølgelser, og i den kommende Verden et evigt Liv.
 31.  Men mange af de første skulle blive de sidste, og af de sidste
      de første."

 32.  Men de vare på Vejen op til Jerusalem; og Jesus gik foran dem,
      og de vare forfærdede, og de, som fulgte med, vare bange. Og han
      tog atter de tolv til sig og begyndte at sige dem, hvad der
      skulde times ham
 33.  "Se, vi drage op til Jerusalem, og Menneskesønnen skal overgives
      til Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge, og de skulle dømme ham
      til Døden og overgive ham til Hedningerne;
 34.  og de skulle spotte ham og spytte på ham og hudstryge ham og
      ihjelslå ham, og tre Dage efter skal han opstå."

 35.  Og Jakob og Johannes, Zebedæus's Sønner, gå hen til ham og sige:
      "Mester! vi ønske, at du vil gøre for os det, vi ville bede dig
      om."
 36.  Og han sag,de til dem: "Hvad ønske I, at jeg skal gøre for
      eder?"
 37.  Men de sagde til ham: "Giv os, at vi må sidde, den ene ved din
      højre Side og den anden ved din venstre Side i din Herlighed."
 38.  Men Jesus sagde til dem: "I vide ikke, hvad I bede om. Kunne I
      drikke den Kalk, som jeg drikker, eller døbes med den Dåb, som
      jeg døbes med?"
 39.  Men de sagde til ham: "Det kunne vi." Men Jesus sagde til dem:
      "Den Kalk, som jeg drikker, skulle I drikke, og den Dåb, som jeg
      døbes med, skulle I døbes med;
 40.  men det at sidde ved min højre eller ved min venstre Side
      tilkommer det ikke mig at give; men det gives til dem, hvem det
      er beredt."
 41.  Og da de ti hørte det, begyndte de at blive, vrede på Jakob og
      Johannes.
 42.  Og Jesus kaldte dem til sig og siger til dem: "I vide, at de,
      der gælde for Folkenes Fyrster; herske over dem, og de store
      iblandt dem bruge Myndighed over dem.
 43.  Men således er det ikke iblandt eder; men den, som vil blive
      stor iblandt eder, skal være eders Tjener;
 44.  og den, som vil blive den første af eder, skal være alles
      Tjener;
 45.  thi også Menneskesønnen er ikke kommen for at lade sig tjene,
      men for at tjene og give sit Liv til en Genløsning for mange."

 46.  Og de komme til Jeriko; og da han gik ud af Jeriko tillige med
      sine, Disciple og en stor Skare, sad Timæus's Søn, Bartimæus, en
      blind Tigger, ved Vejen.
 47.  Og da han hørte, at det var Jesus af Nazareth, begyndte han at
      råbe og sige: "Du Davids Søn, Jesus, forbarm dig over mig!"
 48.  Og mange truede ham,for at han skulde tie; men han råbte meget
      stærkere: "Du Davids Søn, forbarm dig over mig!"
 49.  Og Jesus stod stille og sagde: "Kalder på ham!" Og de kalde på
      den blinde og sige til ham: "Vær frimodig, stå op! han kalder på
      dig."
 50.  Men han kastede sin Overkjortel af sig, sprang op og kom til
      Jesus.
 51.  Og Jesus tog til Orde og sagde til ham: "Hvad vil du, at jeg
      skal gøre for dig?" Men den blinde sagde til ham: "Rabbuni, at
      jeg kan blive seende!"
 52.  Og Jesus sagde til ham: "Gå bort, din Tro har frelst dig." Og
      straks blev han seende, og han fulgte ham på Vejen.

Markus 11

  1.  Og da de nærme sig Jerusalem til Bethfage og Betania ved
      Oliebjerget, udsender han to af sine Disciple og siger til dem:
  2.  "Går hen til den Landsby, som ligger lige for eder, og straks,
      når I komme ind i den, skulle I finde et Føl bundet, på hvilket
      der endnu aldrig har siddet noget Menneske; løser det og fører
      det hid!
  3.  Og dersom nogen siger til eder: Hvorfor gøre I dette? da siger:
      Herren har Brug for det, og han sender det straks herhen igen."
  4.  Og de gik hen og fandt Føllet bundet ved Døren udenfor ved
      Gyden, og de løse det.
  5.  Og nogle af dem, som stode der, sagde til dem: "Hvad gøre I, at
      I løse Føllet?"
  6.  Men de sagde til dem, ligesom Jesus havde sagt, og de tilstedte
      dem det.
  7.  Og de føre Føllet til Jesus og lægge deres Klæder på det, og han
      satte sig på det.
  8.  Og mange bredte deres Klæder på Vejen, andre Kviste, som de
      afskare på Markerne.
  9.  Og de, som gik foran, og de, som fulgte efter, råbte: "Hosanna!
      velsignet være den, som kommer, i Herrens Navn!
 10.  Velsignet være vor Fader Davids Rige, som kommer, Hosanna i det
      højeste!"
 11.  Og han gik ind i Jerusalem, i Helligdommen, og da han havde
      beset alt, gik han, da det allerede var Aftenstid, ud til
      Bethania med de tolv.

 12.  Og den følgende Dag; da de gik ud fra Bethania, blev han
      hungrig.
 13.  Og da han så et Figentræ langt borte, som havde Blade, gik han
      derhen, om han måske kunde finde noget derpå, og da han kom til
      det, fandt han intet uden Blade; thi det var ikke Figentid.
 14.  Og han tog til Orde og sagde til det: "Aldrig i Evighed skal
      nogen mere spise Frugt af dig!" Og hans Disciple hørte det.

 15.  Og de komme til Jerusalem; og han gik ind i Helligdommen og
      begyndte at uddrive dem, som solgte og købte i Helligdommen, og
      han væltede Vekselerernes Borde og Duekræmmernes Stole.
 16.  Og han tilstedte ikke, at nogen bar nogen Ting igennem
      Helligdommen.  17. Og han lærte og sagde til dem: "Er der ikke
      skrevet, at mit Hus skal kaldes et Bedehus for alle
      Folkeslagene? Men I have gjort det til en Røverkule."
 18.  Og Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge hørte det, og de søgte,
      hvorledes de kunde slå ham ihjel; thi de frygtede for ham,
      eftersom hele Skaren blev slagen af, Forundring over hans Lære.

 19.  Og da det blev Aften, gik han uden for Staden.
 20.  Og da de om Morgenen gik forbi, så de, at Figentræet var visnet
      fra Roden af.
 21.  Og Peter kom det i Hu og siger til ham; "Rabbi! se, Figentræet,
      som du forbandede, er visnet."
 22.  Og Jesus svarede og siger til dem: "Haver Tro til Gud!
 23.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, den, som siger til dette Bjerg: Løft
      dig op og; kast dig i Havet, og ikke tvivler i sit Hjerte, men
      tror, at det sker, som han siger, ham skal det ske.
 24.  Derfor siger jeg eder: Alt, hvad I bede om og begære, tror, at I
      have fået det, så skal det ske eder.
 25.  Og når I stå og bede, da forlader, dersom I have noget imod
      nogen, for at også eders Fader, som er i Himlene, må forlade
      eder eders Overtrædelser.
 26.  Men dersom I ikke forlade, skal eders Fader, som er i Himlene,
      ej heller forlade eders Overtrædelser"

 27.  Og de komme atter til Jerusalem; og medens han gik omkring i
      Helligdommen, komme Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge og de
      Ældste hen til ham.
 28.  Og de sagde til ham: "Af hvad Magt gør du disse Ting? eller hvem
      har givet dig denne Magt til at gøre disse Ting?"
 29.  Men Jesus sagde til dem: "Jeg vil spørge eder om een Ting, og
      svarer mig derpå, så vil jeg sige eder, af hvad Magt jeg gør
      disse Ting.
 30.  Johannes's Dåb, var den fra Himmelen eller fra Mennesker? Svarer
      mig!"
 31.  Og de tænkte ved sig selv og sagde: "Sige vi: Fra Himmelen, da
      vil han sige, hvorfor troede I ham da ikke?
 32.  Men sige vi: Fra Mennesker" så frygtede de for Folket; thi alle
      holdt for, at Johannes virkelig var en Profet.
 33.  Og de svare og sige til Jesus: "Vi vide det ikke." Og Jesus
      siger til dem: "Så siger jeg eder ikke heller, af hvad Magt jeg
      gør disse Ting."

Markus 12

  1.  Og han begyndte at tale til dem i Lignelser: "En Mand plantede
      en Vingård og satte et Gærde derom og gravede en Perse og
      byggede et Tårn, og han lejede den ud til Vingårdsmænd og drog
      udenlands.
  2.  Og da Tiden kom, sendte han en Tjener til Vingårdsmændene, for
      at han af Vingårdsmændene kunde få af Vingårdens Frugter.
  3.  Og de grebe ham og sloge ham og sendte ham tomhændet bort.
  4.  Og han sendte atter en anden Tjener til dem; og ham sloge de i
      Hovedet og vanærede.
  5.  Og han sendte en anden; og ham sloge de ihjel; og mange andre;
      nogle sloge de, og andre dræbte de.
  6.  Endnu een havde han, en elsket Søn; ham sendte han til sidst til
      dem, idet han sagde: "De ville undse sig for min Søn."
  7.  Men hine Vingårdsmænd sagde til hverandre: "Der er Arvingen;
      kommer lader os slå ham ihjel, så bliver Arven vor."
  8.  Og de grebe ham og sloge ham ihjel og kastede ham ud af
      Vingården.
  9.  Hvad vil da Vingårdens Herre gøre? Han vil komme og ødelægge
      Vingårdsmændene og give Vingården til andre.
 10.  Have I ikke også læst dette Skriftord: Den Sten, som
      Bygningsmændene forkastede, den er bleven til en
      Hovedhjørnesten?
 11.  Fra Herren er dette kommet, og det er underligt for vore Øjne."
 12.  Og de søgte at gribe ham, men de frygtede for Mængden; thi de
      forstode, at han sagde denne Lignelse imod dem; og de forlode
      ham og gik bort.

 13.  Og de sendte nogle til ham af Farisæerne og af Herodianerne, for
      at de skulde fange ham i Ord.
 14.  Og de kom og sagde til ham: "Mester! vi vide, at du er sanddru
      og ikke bryder dig om nogen; thi du ser ikke på Menneskers
      Person, men lærer Guds Vej i Sandhed. Er det tilladt at give
      Kejseren Skat eller ej? Skulle vi give eller ikke give?"
 15.  Men da han så deres Hykleri, sagde han til dem: "Hvorfor friste
      I mig? Bringer mig en Denar", for at jeg kan se den."
 16.  Men de bragte den. Og han siger til dem: "Hvis Billede og
      Overskrift er dette?" Men de sagde til ham: "Kejserens."
 17.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "Giver Kejseren, hvad Kejserens er, og
      Gud, hvad Guds er." Og de undrede sig over ham.

 18.  Og der kommer Saddukæere til ham, hvilke jo sige, at der ingen
      Opstandelse er, og de spurgte ham og sagde:
 19.  "Mester! Moses har foreskrevet os, at når nogens Broder dør og
      og efterlader, en Hustru og ikke efterlader noget Barn, da skal
      hans Broder tage hans Hustru og oprejse sin Broder Afkom.
 20.  Der var syv Brødre; og den første tog en Hustru, og da han døde,
      efterlod han ikke Afkom.
 21.  Og den anden tog hende og døde uden at efterlade Afkom, og den
      tredje ligeså.
 22.  Og alle syv, de efterlode ikke Afkom. Sidst af dem alle døde og
      så Hustruen.
 23.  I Opstandelsen, når de opstå, hvem af dem skal så have hende til
      Hustru? Thi de have alle syv haft hende til Hustru."
 24.  Jesus sagde til dem: "Er det ikke derfor, I fare vild, fordi I
      ikke kende Skrifterne, ej heller Guds Kraft?
 25.  Thi når de opstå fra de døde, da tage de hverken til Ægte eller
      bortgiftes, men de ere som Engle i Himlene.
 26.  Men hvad de døde angår, at de oprejses, have I da ikke læst i
      Mose Bog i Stedet om Tornebusken, hvorledes Gud talede til ham
      og sagde: Jeg er Abrahams Gud og Isaks Gud og Jakobs Gud?
 27.  Han er ikke dødes, men levendes Gud; I fare meget vild."

 28.  Og en af de skriftkloge, som havde hørt deres Ordskifte og set,
      at han svarede dem godt, kom til ham og spurgte ham: "Hvilket
      Bud er det første af alle?"
 29.  Jesus svarede: "Det første er: Hør Israel! Herren, vor Gud,
      Herren er een;
 30.  og du skal elske Herren, din Gud af hele dit Hjerte og af hele
      din Sjæl og af hele dit Sind og af hele din Styrke.
 31.  Et andet er dette: Du skal elske din Næste som dig selv. Større
      end disse er intet andet Bud."
 32.  Og den skriftkloge sagde til ham: "Rigtigt, Mester, og med
      Sandhed har du sagt, at han er een, og der er ingen anden
      foruden ham.
 33.  Og at elske ham af hele sit Hjerte og af hele sin Forstand og af
      hele sin Styrke og at elske sin Næste som sig selv, det er mere
      end alle Brændofrene og Slagtofrene."
 34.  Og da Jesus så, at han svarede forstandigt, sagde han til ham:
      "Du er ikke langt fra Guds Rige." Og ingen vovede mere at rette
      Spørgsmål til ham.

 35.  Og da Jesus lærte i Helligdommen, tog han til Orde og sagde:
      "Hvorledes sige de skriftkloge, at Kristus er Davids Søn?
 36.  David selv sagde ved den Helligånd: Herren sagde til min Herre:
      Sæt dig ved min, højre Hånd, indtil jeg får lagt dine Fjender
      som en Skammel for dine Fødder.
 37.  David selv kalder ham Herre; hvorledes er han da hans Søn?" Og
      den store Skare hørte ham gerne.

 38.  Og han sagde i sin Undervisning: "Tager eder i Vare for de
      skriftkloge, som gerne ville gå i lange Klæder og lade sig hilse
      på Torvene
 39.  og gerne ville have de fornemste Pladser i Synagogerne og sidde
      øverst til Bords ved Måltiderne;
 40.  de, som opæde Enkers Huse og på Skrømt bede længe, disse skulle
      få des hårdere Dom."

 41.  Og han satte sig lige over for Tempelblokken og så, hvorledes
      Mængden lagde Penge i Blokken, og mange rige lagde meget deri.
 42.  Og der kom en fattig Enke og lagde to Skærve i, hvilket er en
      Hvid".
 43.  Og han kaldte sine Disciple til sig og sagde til dem: "Sandelig,
      siger jeg eder, denne fattige Enke har lagt mere deri end alle
      de som lagde i Tempelblokken.
 44.  Thi de lagde alle af deres Overflod; men hun lagde af sin
      Fattigdom alt det, hun havde, sin hele Ejendom."

Markus 13

  1.  og da han gik ud af Helligdommen, siger en af hans Disciple til
      ham: "Mester, se, hvilke Sten og hvilke Bygninger!"
  2.  Og Jesus sagde til ham: "Ser du disse store Bygninger? der skal
      ikke lades Sten på Sten, som jo skal nedbrydes."
  3.  Og da han sad på Oliebjerget, lige over for Helligdommen,
      spurgte Peter og Jakob og Johannes og Andreas ham afsides:
  4.  "Sig os, når skal dette ske, og hvilket er Tegnet, når alt dette
      skal til at fuldbyrdes?"
  5.  Men Jesus begyndte at sige til dem: "Ser til, at ingen forfører
      eder!"
  6.  Mange skulle på mit Navn komme og sige: Det er mig; og de skulle
      forføre mange.
  7.  Men når I høre om Krige og Krigsrygter, da lader eder ikke
      forskrække, thi det må ske; men Enden er ikke endda.
  8.  Thi Folk skal rejse sig mod Folk, og Rige mod Rige, og der skal
      være Jordskælv her og der, og der skal være Hungersnød og
      Oprør. Dette er Veernes Begyndelse.
  9.  Men I, tager Vare på eder selv; de skulle overgive eder til
      Rådsforsamlinger og til Synagoger; I skulle piskes og stilles
      for Landshøvdinger og Konger for min Skyld, dem til et
      Vidnesbyrd.
 10.  Og Evangeliet bør først prædikes for alle Folkeslagene.
 11.  Og når de føre eder hen og overgive eder, da bekymrer eder ikke
      forud for, hvad I skulle tale; men hvad der bliver givet eder i
      den samme Time, det skulle I tale; thi I ere ikke de, som tale,
      men den Helligånd.
 12.  Og Broder skal overgive Broder til Døden, og Fader sit Barn og
      Børn skulle stå op mod Forældre og slå dem ihjel.
 13.  Og I skulle hades af alle for mit Navns Skyld; men den, som
      holder ud indtil Enden, han skal blive frelst.
 14.  Men når I se Ødelæggelsens Vederstyggelighed stå, hvor den ikke
      bør, (den, som læser det, han give Agt! ) da skulle de, som ere
      i Judæa, fly til Bjergene;
 15.  men den, som er på Taget, stige ikke ned eller gå ind for at
      hente noget fra sit Hus;
 16.  og den, som er på Marken, vende ikke tilbage for at hente sine
      Klæder!
 17.  Men ve de frugtsommelige og dem, som give Die, i de Dage!
 18.  Men beder om, at det ikke skal ske om Vinteren;
 19.  thi i de Dage skal der være en sådan Trængsel som der ikke har
      været fra Skabningens Begyndelse, da Gud skabte den, indtil nu,
      og som der heller ikke skal komme.
 20.  Og dersom Herren ikke afkortede de dage, da blev intet Kød
      frelst; men for de udvalgtes Skyld, som han har udvalgt, har han
      afkortet de Dage
 21.  Og dersom nogen da siger til eder: Se, her er Kristus, eller se
      der! da tror det ikke.
 22.  Thi falske Krister og falske Profeter skulle fremstå og gøre
      Tegn og Undergerninger for at forføre, om det var muligt, de
      udvalgte.
 23.  Men I, vogter eder; jeg har sagt eder alt forud.
 24.  Men i de dage, efter den Trængsel, skal Solen formørkes, og
      Månen ikke give sit Skin,
 25.  og Stjernerne skulle falde ned fra Himmelen, og de Kræfter, som
      ere i Himlene, skulle rystes.
 26.  Og da skulle de se Menneskesønnen komme i Skyerne med megen
      Kraft og Herlighed.
 27.  Og da skal han udsende sine Engle og samle sine udvalgte fra de
      fire Vinde, fra Jordens Ende indtil Himmelens Ende.
 28.  Men lærer Lignelsen af Figentræet: Når dets Gren allerede er
      bleven blød, og Bladene skyde frem, da skønne I, at Sommeren er
      nær.
 29.  Således skulle også I, når I se disse Ting, skønne, af han er
      nær for Døren.
 30.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, denne Slægt skal ingenlunde forgå,
      førend alle disse ting ere skete
 31.  Himmelen og Jorden skulle forgå, men mine Ord skulle ingenlunde
      forgå:
 32.  Men om den Dag og Time ved ingen, end ikke Englene i Himmelen,
      heller ikke Sønnen, men alene Faderen.

 33.  Ser til, våger og beder; thi I vide ikke, når Tiden er der.
 34.  Ligesom en Mand, der drog udenlands, forlod sit Hus og gav sine
      Tjenere Fuldmagt, hver sin Gerning, og bød Dørvogteren, at han
      skulde våge,
 35.  våger derfor; thi I vide ikke, når Husets Herre kommer, enten om
      Aftenen eller ved Midnat eller ved Hanegal eller om Morgenen;
 36.  for at han ikke, når han kommer pludseligt, skal finde eder
      sovende!
 37.  Men hvad jeg siger eder, det siger jeg alle: Våger!"

Markus 14

  1.  Men to Dage derefter var det Påske og de usyrede Brøds
      Højtid. Og Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge søgte, hvorledes
      de med List kunde gribe og ihjelslå ham.
  2.  Thi de sagde: "Ikke på Højtiden, for at der ikke skal blive
      Oprør iblandt Folket."

  3.  Og da han var i Bethania, i Simon den spedalskes Hus, kom der,
      medens han sad til Bords, en Kvinde, som havde en Alabastkrukke
      med ægte, såre kostbar Nardussalve; og hun sønderbrød
      Alabastkrukken og udgød den på hans Hoved.
  4.  Men der var nogle, som bleve vrede hos sig selv og sagde:
      "Hvortil er denne Spilde af Salven sket?
  5.  Denne Salve kunde jo være solgt for mere end tre Hundrede
      Denarer og være given til de fattige." Og de overfusede hende.
  6.  Men Jesus sagde: "Lader hende være, hvorfor volde I hende
      Fortrædeligheder? Hun har gjort en god Gerning imod mig.
  7.  De fattige have I jo altid hos eder, og når I ville, kunne I
      gøre vel imod dem; men mig have I ikke altid.
  8.  Hun gjorde, hvad hun kunde; hun salvede forud mit Legeme til
      Begravelsen.
  9.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, hvor som helst i hele Verden
      Evangeliet bliver prædiket, skal også det, som hun har gjort,
      omtales til hendes Ihukommelse."

 10.  Og Judas Iskariot, en af de tolv, gik hen til Ypperstepræsterne
      for at forråde ham til dem.
 11.  Men da de hørte det, bleve de glade, og de lovede at give ham
      Penge; og han søgte, hvorledes han kunde få Lejlighed til at
      forråde ham.

 12.  Og på de usyrede Brøds første Dag, da man slagtede Påskelammet,
      sige hans Disciple til ham: "Hvor vil du, at vi skulle gå hen og
      træffe Forberedelse til, at du kan spise Påskelammet?"
 13.  Og han sender to af sine Disciple og siger til dem: "Går ind i
      Staden, så skal der møde eder en Mand, som bærer en Vandkrukke;
      følger ham;
 14.  og hvor han går ind, der skulle I sige til Husbonden: Mesteren
      siger: Hvor er mit Herberge, hvor jeg kan spise Påskelammet med
      mine Disciple?
 15.  Og han skal vise eder en stor Sal, opdækket og rede; og der
      skulle I berede det for os."
 16.  Og hans Disciple gik bort og kom ind i Staden og fandt det,
      således som han havde sagt dem; og de beredte Påskelammet.
 17.  Og da det var blevet Aften, kommer han med de tolv.
 18.  Og medens de sade til Bords og spiste, sagde Jesus: "Sandelig,
      siger jeg eder, en af eder, som spiser med mig, vil forråde
      mig."
 19.  De begyndte at bedrøves og at sige til ham, en efter en: "Det er
      dog vel ikke mig?"
 20.  Men han sagde til dem: "En af de tolv, den, som dypper med mig i
      Fadet
 21.  Thi Menneskesønnen går vel bort, som der er skrevet om ham; men
      ve det, Menneske ved hvem Menneskesønnen bliver forrådt! Det var
      godt for det Menneske, om han ikke var født."

 22.  Og medens de spiste, tog han Brød, velsignede og brød det og gav
      dem det og sagde: "Tager det; dette er mit Legeme."
 23.  Og han tog en Kalk, takkede og gav dem den; og de drak alle
      deraf.
 24.  Og han sagde til dem: "Dette er mit Blod, Pagtens, hvilket
      udgydes for mange.
 25.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, at jeg skal ingen Sinde mere drikke af
      Vintræets Frugt indtil den Dag, da jeg skal drikke den ny i Guds
      Rige."

 26.  Og da de havde sunget Lovsangen, gik de ud til Oliebjerget
 27.  Og Jesus siger til dem: "I skulle alle forarges; thi der er
      skrevet: Jeg vil slå Hyrden, og Fårene skulle adspredes.
 28.  Men efter at jeg er bleven oprejst, vil jeg gå forud for eder
      til Galilæa."
 29.  Men Peter sagde til ham: "Dersom de endog alle forarges, vil jeg
      dog ikke forarges."
 30.  Og Jesus siger til ham: "Sandelig siger jeg dig, i Dag, i denne
      Nat, førend Hanen galer to Gange, skal du fornægte mig tre
      Gange."
 31.  Men han sagde end yderligere: "Om jeg end skulde dø med dig, vil
      jeg ingenlunde fornægte dig." Men ligeså sagde de også alle.

 32.  Og de komme til en Gård, hvis Navn var Gethsemane; og han siger
      til sine Disciple "Sætter eder her, imedens jeg beder."
 33.  Og han tager Peter og Jakob og Johannes med sig, og han begyndte
      at forfærdes og svarlig at ængstes.
 34.  Og han siger til dem: "Min Sjæl er dybt bedrøvet indtil Døden;
      bliver her og våger!"
 35.  Og han gik lidt frem, kastede sig ned på Jorden og bad om, at
      den Time måtte gå ham forbi, om det var muligt.
 36.  Og han sagde: "Abba Fader! alting er dig muligt; tag denne Kalk
      fra mig; dog ikke hvad jeg vil, men hvad du vil."
 37.  Og han kommer og finder dem sovende og siger til Peter: "Simon,
      sover du? Kunde du ikke våge een Time?
 38.  Våger, og beder, for at I ikke skulle falde i Fristelse; Ånden
      er vel redebon, men Kødet er skrøbeligt."
 39.  Og han gik atter hen og bad og sagde det samme Ord,
 40.  Og han vendte tilbage og fandt dem atter sovende; thi deres Øjne
      vare betyngede, og de vidste ikke, hvad de skulde svare ham.
 41.  Og han kommer tredje Gang og siger til dem: "Sove I fremdeles og
      hvile eder? Det er nok; Timen er kommen; se, Menneskesønnen
      forrådes i Synderes Hænder.
 42.  Står op, lader os gå; se, han, som forråder mig, er nær."

 43.  Og straks, medens han endnu talte, kommer Judas, en af de tolv,
      og med ham en stor Skare med Sværd og Knipler fra
      Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge og de Ældste.
 44.  Men han, som forrådte ham, havde givet dem et aftalt Tegn og
      sagt: "Den, som jeg kysser, ham er det; griber ham, og fører ham
      sikkert bort!"
 45.  Og da han kom, trådte han straks hen til ham og siger: "Rabbi!
      Rabbi!" og han kyssede ham.
 46.  Men de lagde Hånd på ham og grebe ham.
 47.  Men en af dem, som stode hos, drog Sværdet, slog
      Ypperstepræstens Tjener og afhuggede hans Øre.
 48.  Og Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "I ere gåede ud som imod en
      Røver, med Sværd og med Knipler for at fange mig.
 49.  Daglig var jeg hos eder i Helligdommen og lærte, og I grebe mig
      ikke; men dette sker, for af Skrifterne skulle opfyldes."
 50.  Og de forlode ham alle og flyede.
 51.  Og en enkelt, et ungt Menneske, som havde et Linklæde over det
      blotte Legeme, fulgte med ham; og de gribe ham;
 52.  men han slap Linklædet og flygtede nøgen.

 53.  Og de førte Jesus hen til Ypperstepræsten; og alle
      Ypperstepræsterne og de Ældste og de skriftkloge komme sammen
      hos ham.
 54.  Og Peter fulgte ham i Frastand til ind i Ypperstepræstens Gård,
      og han sad hos Svendene og varmede sig ved Ilden.
 55.  Men Ypperstepræsterne og hele Rådet søgte Vidnesbyrd imod Jesus,
      for at de kunde aflive ham; og de fandt intet.
 56.  Thi mange sagde falsk Vidnesbyrd imod ham, men Vidnesbyrdene
      stemte ikke overens.
 57.  Og nogle stode op og vidnede falsk imod ham og sagde:
 58.  "Vi have hørt ham sige: Jeg vil nedbryde dette Tempel, som er
      gjort med Hænder, og i tre Dage bygge et andet, som ikke er
      gjort med Hænder."
 59.  Og end ikke således stemte deres Vidnesbyrd overens.
 60.  Og Ypperstepræsten stod op midt iblandt dem og spurgte Jesus og
      sagde: "Svarer du slet intet på, hvad disse vidne imod dig?"
 61.  Men han tav og svarede intet. Atter spurgte Ypperstepræsten ham
      og siger til ham: "Er du Kristus, den Højlovedes Søn?"
 62.  Men Jesus sagde: "Jeg er det; og I skulle se Menneskesønnen
      sidde ved Kraftens højre Hånd og komme med Himmelens Skyer."
 63.  Men Ypperstepræsten sønderrev sine Klæder og sagde: "Hvad have
      vi længere Vidner nødig?
 64.  I have hørt Gudsbespottelsen; hvad tykkes eder?" Men de fældede
      alle den Dom over ham, at han var skyldig til Døden.
 65.  Og nogle begyndte af spytte på ham og tilhylle hans Ansigt og
      give ham Næveslag og sige til ham: "Profeter!" og Svendene
      modtoge ham med Slag på Kinden.

 66.  Og medens Peter var nedenfor i Gården, kommer en af
      Ypperstepræstens Piger,
 67.  og da hun ser Peter varme sig, ser hun på ham og siger: "Også du
      var med Nazaræeren, med Jesus."
 68.  Men han nægtede og sagde: "Jeg hverken ved eller forstår, hvad
      du siger;" og han gik ud i Forgården, og Hanen galede.
 69.  Og Pigen så ham og begyndte atter at sige til dem, som stode
      hos: "Denne er en af dem."
 70.  Men han nægtede det atter. Og lidt derefter sagde atter de, som
      stode hos, til Peter: "Sandelig, du er en af dem; du er jo også
      en Galilæer."
 71.  Men han begyndte at forbande sig og sværge: "Jeg kender ikke
      dette Menneske, om hvem I tale."
 72.  Og straks galede Hanen anden Gang. Og Peter kom det Ord i Hu,
      som Jesus sagde til ham: "Førend Hanen galer to Gange, skal du
      fornægte mig tre Gange." Og han brast i Gråd.

Markus 15

  1.  Og straks om Morgenen, da Ypperstepræsterne havde holdt Råd med
      de Ældste og de skriftkloge, hele Rådet, bandt de Jesus og førte
      ham bort og overgave ham til Pilatus.
  2.  Og Pilatus spurgte ham: "Er du Jødernes Konge?" Og han svarede
      og sagde til ham: "Du siger det."
  3.  Og Ypperstepræsterne anklagede ham meget.
  4.  Men Pilatus spurgte ham atter og sagde: "Svarer du slet intet?
      Se, hvor meget de anklage dig for!"
  5.  Men Jesus svarede ikke mere noget, så at Pilatus undrede sig.
  6.  Men på Højtiden plejede han at løslade dem een Fange, hvilken de
      forlangte.
  7.  Men der var en, som hed Barabbas, der var fangen tillige med de
      Oprørere, som under Oprøret havde begået Mord
  8.  Og Mængden gik op og begyndte at bede om, at han vilde gøre for
      dem, som han plejede.
  9.  Men Pilatus svarede dem og sagde: "Ville I, at jeg skal løslade
      eder Jødernes Konge?"
 10.  Thi han skønnede, at det var af Avind, at Ypperstepræsterne
      havde overgivet ham.
 11.  Men Ypperstepræsterne ophidsede Mængden til at bede om, at han
      hellere skulde løslade dem Barabbas.
 12.  Men Pilatus svarede atter og sagde til dem: "Hvad ville I da,
      jeg skal gøre med ham, som I kalde Jødernes Konge?"
 13.  Men de råbte atter: "Korsfæst ham!"
 14.  Men Pilatus sagde til dem: "Hvad ondt har han da gjort?" Men de
      råbte højlydt: "Korsfæst ham!"
 15.  Og da Pilatus vilde gøre Mængden tilpas, løslod han dem
      Barabbas; og Jesus lod han hudstryge og gav ham hen til at
      korsfæstes.

 16.  Men Stridsmændene førte ham ind i Gården, det vil sige Borgen,
      og de sammenkalde hele Vagtafdelingen.
 17.  Og de iføre ham en Purpurkappe og flette en Tornekrone og sætte
      den på ham.
 18.  Og de begyndte at hilse ham: "Hil være dig, du Jødernes Konge!"
 19.  Og de sloge ham på Hovedet med et Rør og spyttede på ham og
      faldt på Knæ og tilbade ham.
 20.  Og da de havde spottet ham, toge de Purpurkappen af ham og
      iførte ham hans egne Klæder. Og de føre ham ud for at korsfæste
      ham.

 21.  Og de tvinge en, som gik forbi, Simon fra Kyrene, som kom fra
      Marken, Aleksanders og Rufus's Fader, til af bære hans Kors.
 22.  Og de føre ham til det Sted Golgatha, det er udlagt:
      "Hovedskalsted"
 23.  Og de gave ham Vin at drikke med Myrra i; men han tog det ikke.
 24.  Og de korsfæste ham, og de dele hans Klæder ved at kaste Lod om
      dem, hvad enhver skulde tage.
 25.  Men det var den tredje Time, da de korsfæstede ham.
 26.  Og Overskriften med Beskyldningen imod ham var påskreven
      således: "Jødernes Konge".
 27.  Og de korsfæste to Røvere sammen med ham, en ved hans højre og
      en ved hans venstre Side.
 28.  Og Skriften blev opfyldt, som siger: "Og han blev regnet iblandt
      Overtrædere."
 29.  Og de, som gik forbi, spottede ham, idet de rystede på deres
      Hoveder og sagde: "Tvi dig! du som nedbryder Templet og bygger
      det op i tre Dage;
 30.  frels dig selv ved at stige ned af Korset!"
 31.  Ligeså spottede også Ypperstepræsterne indbyrdes tillige med de
      skriftkloge og sagde: "Andre har han frelst, sig selv kan han
      ikke frelse.
 32.  Kristus, Israels Konge - lad ham nu stige ned af Korset, for at
      vi kunne se det og, tro!" Også de, som vare korsfæstede med ham,
      hånede ham.
 33.  Og da den sjette Time var kommen, blev der Mørke over hele
      Landet indtil den niende Time.
 34.  Og ved den niende Time råbte Jesus med høj Røst og sagde: "Eloi!
      Eloi! Lama Sabaktani?" det er udlagt: "Min Gud! min Gud! hvorfor
      har du forladt mig?"
 35.  Og nogle af dem, som stode hos, sagde, da de hørte det: "Se; han
      kalder på Elias."
 36.  Men en løb hen og fyldte en Svamp med Eddike og stak den på et
      Rør og gav ham at drikke og sagde: "Holdt! lader os se, om Elias
      kommer for at tage ham ned."
 37.  Men Jesus råbte med høj Røst og udåndede.

 38.  Og Forhænget i Templet splittedes i to fra øverst til nederst.
 39.  Men da Høvedsmanden, som stod hos, lige over for ham, så, af han
      udåndede på denne Vis, sagde han: "Sandelig, dette Menneske var
      Guds Søn."
 40.  Men der var også Kvinder, som så til i Frastand, iblandt hvilke
      også vare Maria Magdalene og Maria, Jakob den Lilles og Joses's
      Moder, og Salome,
 41.  hvilke også fulgte ham og tjente ham, da han var i Galilæa, og
      mange andre Kvinder, som vare gåede op til Jerusalem med ham.

 42.  Og da det allerede var blevet Aften, (thi det var Beredelsesdag,
      det er Forsabbat,)
 43.  kom Josef fra Arimathæa, en anset Rådsherre, som også selv
      forventede Guds Rige; han tog Mod til sig og gik ind til Pilatus
      og bad om Jesu Legeme.
 44.  Men Pilatus forundrede sig over, at han allerede skulde være
      død,
 45.  og han hidkaldte Høvedsmanden og spurgte ham, om han allerede
      nogen Tid havde været død; og da han fik det at vide af
      Høvedsmanden, skænkede han Josef Liget.
 46.  Og denne købte et fint Linklæde, tog ham ned, svøbte ham i
      Linklædet og lagde ham i en Grav, som var udhugget i en Klippe,
      og han, væltede en Sten for Indgangen til Graven.
 47.  Men Maria Magdalene og Maria, Joses's Moder, så, hvor ham blev
      lagt.

Markus 16

  1.  Og da Sabbaten var forbi købte Maria Magdalene og Maria, Jakobs
      Moder, og Salome vellugtende Salver for at komme og Salve ham.
  2.  Og meget årle på den første Dag i Ugen komme de til Graven, da
      Solen var stået op.
  3.  Og de sagde til hverandre: "Hvem skal vælte os Stenen fra
      Indgangen til Graven?"
  4.  Og da de så op, bleve de var, at Stenen var væltet fra; (thi den
      var meget stor)
  5.  Og da de kom ind i Graven, så de en Yngling sidde ved den højre
      Side, iført et hvidt Klædebon, og de forfærdedes.
  6.  Men han siger til dem: "Forfærdes ikke! I lede efter Jesus at
      Nazareth, den korsfæstede; han er opstanden, han er ikke her,
      se, der er Stedet, hvor de lagde ham.
  7.  Men går bort, siger til hans Disciple og til Peter at han går
      forud for eder til Galilæa; der skulle I se ham, som han har
      sagt eder."
  8.  Og de gik ud og flyede fra Graven; thi Skælven og Forfærdelse
      betog dem; og de sagde ikke noget til nogen; thi de frygtede.

  9.  Men da han var opstanden årle den første Dag i Ugen, åbenbaredes
      han først for Maria Magdalene, af hvem han havde uddrevet syv
      onde Ånder.
 10.  Hun gik hen og forkyndte det for dem, der havde været med ham,
      og som sørgede og græd.
 11.  Og da disse hørte, at han levede og var set af hende, troede de
      det ikke.
 12.  Men derefter åbenbaredes han for to af dem på Vejen i en anden
      Skikkelse, medens de gik ud på Landet.
 13.  Og disse gik hen og forkyndte de andre det. Ikke heller dem
      troede de.
 14.  Siden åbenbaredes han for de elleve selv, medens de sade til
      Bords, og han bebrejdede dem deres Vantro og Hjerters Hårdhed,
      fordi de ikke havde troet dem, som havde set ham opstanden.
 15.  Og han sagde til dem: "Går ud i al Verden og prædiker Evangeliet
      for al Skabningen!
 16.  Den, som tror og bliver døbt, skal blive frelst; men den, som
      ikke tror, skal blive fordømt.
 17.  Men disse Tegn skulle følge dem, som tro: I mit Navn skulle de
      uddrive onde Ånder; de skulle tale med nye Tunger;
 18.  de skulle tage på Slanger, og dersom de drikke nogen Gift, skal
      det ikke skade dem; på syge skulle de lægge Hænder, og de skulle
      helbredes."

 19.  Så blev Herren efter at han havde talt med dem, optagen til
      Himmelen og satte sig ved Guds højre Hånd.
 20.  Men de gik ud og prædikede alle Vegne, idet Herren arbejdede med
      og stadfæstede Ordet ved de medfølgende Tegn.


Lukas

Lukas 1

  1.  Efterdi mange have taget sig for at forfatte en Beretning om de
      Ting, som ere fuldbyrdede iblandt os,
  2.  således som de, der fra Begyndelsen bleve Øjenvidner og Ordets
      Tjenere, have overleveret os:
  3.  så har også jeg besluttet, efter nøje at have gennemgået alt
      forfra, at nedskrive det for dig i Orden, mægtigste Theofilus!
  4.  for at du kan erkende Pålideligheden af de Ting, hvorom du er
      bleven mundtligt undervist.

  5.  I de Dage, da Herodes var Konge i Judæa, var der en Præst af
      Abias Skifte, ved Navn Sakarias; og han havde en Hustru af Arons
      Døtre, og hendes Navn var Elisabeth.
  6.  Men de vare begge retfærdige for Gud og vandrede udadlelige i
      alle Herrens Bud og Forskrifter.
  7.  Og de havde intet Barn, efterdi Elisabeth var ufrugtbar, og de
      vare begge fremrykkede i Alder.
  8.  Men det skete, medens han efter sit Skiftes Orden gjorde
      Præstetjeneste for Gud,
  9.  tilfaldt det ham efter Præstetjenestens Sædvane at gå ind i
      Herrens Tempel og bringe Røgelseofferet.
 10.  Og hele Folkets Mængde holdt Bøn udenfor i Røgelseofferets Time.
 11.  Men en Herrens Engel viste sig for ham, stående ved den højre
      Side af Røgelsesalteret.
 12.  Og da Sakarias så ham, forfærdedes han, og Frygt faldt over ham.
 13.  Men Engelen sagde til ham: "Frygt ikke, Sakarias! thi din Bøn er
      hørt, og din Hustru Elisabeth skal føde dig en Søn, og du skal
      kalde hans Navn Johannes.
 14.  Og han skal blive dig til Glæde og Fryd, og mange skulle glædes
      over hans Fødsel;
 15.  thi han skal være stor for Herren. Og Vin og stærk Drik skal han
      ej drikke, og han skal fyldes med den Helligånd alt fra Moders
      Liv,
 16.  og mange af Israels Børn skal han omvende til Herren deres Gud.
 17.  Og han skal gå foran for ham i Elias's Ånd og Kraft for at vende
      Fædres Hjerter til Børn og genstridige til retfærdiges Sind for
      at berede Herren et velskikket folk."
 18.  Og Sakarias sagde til Engelen: "Hvorpå skal jeg kende dette? thi
      jeg er gammel, og min Hustru er fremrykket i Alder."
 19.  Og Engelen svarede og sagde til ham: "Jeg er Gabriel, som står
      for Guds Åsyn, og jeg er udsendt for at tale til dig og for at
      forkynde dig dette Glædesbudskab.
 20.  Og se, du skal blive stum og ikke kunne tale indtil den Dag, da
      dette sker, fordi du ikke troede mine Ord, som dog skulle
      fuldbyrdes i deres Tid,"
 21.  Og folket biede efter Sakarias, og de undrede sig over, at han
      tøvede i Templet.
 22.  Og da han kom ud, kunde han ikke tale til dem, og de forstode,
      at han havde set et Syn i Templet; og han gjorde Tegn til dem og
      forblev stum.
 23.  Og det skete, da hans Tjenestes Dage vare fuldendte, gik han
      hjem til sit Hus.
 24.  Men efter disse Dage blev hans Hustru Elisabeth frugtsommelig,
      og hun skjulte sig fem Måneder og sagde:
 25.  "Således har Herren gjort imod mig i de Dage, da han så til mig
      for at borttage min Skam iblandt Mennesker:"

 26.  Men i den sjette Måned blev Engelen Gabriel sendt fra Gud til en
      By i Galilæa, som hedder Nazareth,
 27.  til en Jomfru, som var trolovet med en Mand ved Navn Josef, af
      Davids Hus; og Jomfruens Navn var Maria.
 28.  Og Engelen kom ind til hende og sagde: "Hil være dig, du
      benådede, Herren er med dig, du velsignede iblandt Kvinder!"
 29.  Men hun blev forfærdet over den Tale, og hun tænkte, hvad dette
      skulde være for en Hilsen.
 30.  Og Engelen sagde til hende: "Frygt ikke, Maria! thi du har
      fundet Nåde hos Gud.
 31.  Og se, du skal undfange og føde en Søn,og du skal kalde hans
      Navn Jesus.
 32.  Han skal være stor og kaldes den Højestes Søn; og Gud Herren
      skal give ham Davids, hans Faders Trone.
 33.  Og han skal være Konge over Jakobs Hus evindelig, og der skal
      ikke være Ende på hans Kongedømme."
 34.  Men Maria sagde til Engelen: "Hvorledes skal dette gå til,
      efterdi jeg ikke ved af nogen Mand?"
 35.  Og Engelen svarede og sagde til hende: Den Helligånd skal komme
      over dig, og den Højestes Kraft skal overskygge dig; derfor skal
      også det hellige, som fødes,. kaldes Guds Søn.
 36.  Og se, Elisabeth din Frænke, også hun har undfanget en Søn i sin
      Alderdom, og denne Måned er den sjette for hende, som kaldes
      ufrugtbar.
 37.  Thi intet vil være umuligt for Gud."
 38.  Men Maria sagde: "Se, jeg er Herrens Tjenerinde; mig ske efter
      dit Ord!" Og Engelen skiltes fra hende.

 39.  Men Maria stod op i de samme Dage og drog skyndsomt til
      Bjergegnen til en By i Juda.
 40.  Og hun kom ind i Sakarias's Hus og hilste Elisabeth.
 41.  Og det skete, da Elisabeth hørte Marias Hilsen, sprang Fosteret
      i hendes Liv. Og Elisabeth blev fyldt med den Helligånd
 42.  og råbte med høj Røst og sagde: "Velsignet er du iblandt
      Kvinder!  og velsignet er dit Livs Frugt!
 43.  Og hvorledes times dette mig, at min Herres Moder kommer til
      mig?
 44.  Thi se, da din Hilsens Røst nåede mine Øren, sprang Fosteret i
      mit Liv med Fryd.
 45.  Og salig er hun, som troede; thi det skal fuldkommes, hvad der
      er sagt hende af Herren,"
 46.  Og Maria sagde: "Min Sjæl ophøjer Herren;
 47.  og min Ånd fryder sig over Gud, min Frelser;
 48.  thi han har set til sin Tjenerindes Ringhed. Thi se, nu herefter
      skulle alle Slægter prise mig salig,
 49.  fordi den mægtige har gjort store Ting imod mig. Og hans Navn er
      helligt;
 50.  og hans Barmhjertighed varer fra Slægt til Slægt over dem, som
      frygte ham.
 51.  Han har øvet Vælde med sin Arm; han har adspredt dem, som ere
      hovmodige i deres Hjertes Tanke.
 52.  Han har nedstødt mægtige fra Troner og ophøjet ringe.
 53.  Hungrige har han mættet med gode Gaver, og rige har han sendt
      tomhændede bort.
 54.  Han har taget sig af sin Tjener Israel for at ihukomme
      Barmhjertighed
 55.  imod Abraham og hans Sæd til evig Tid, således som han talte til
      vore Fædre."
 56.  Og Maria blev hos hende omtrent tre Måneder, og hun drog til sit
      Hjem igen.

 57.  Men for Elisabeth fuldkommedes Tiden til, at hun skulde føde, og
      hun fødte en Søn.
 58.  Og hendes Naboer og Slægtninge hørte, at Herren havde gjort sin
      Barmhjertighed stor imod hende, og de glædede sig med hende.
 59.  Og det skete på den ottende Dag, da kom de for at omskære
      Barnet; og de vilde kalde det Sakarias efter Faderens Navn.
 60.  Og hans Moder svarede og sagde: "Nej, han skal kaldes Johannes."
 61.  Og de sagde til hende: "Der er ingen i din Slægt, som kaldes med
      dette Navn."
 62.  Men de gjorde Tegn til hans Fader om, hvad han vilde, det skulde
      kaldes.
 63.  Og han forlangte en Tavle og skrev disse Ord: "Johannes er hans
      Navn." Og de undrede sig alle.
 64.  Men straks oplodes hans Mund og hans Tunge, og han talte og
      priste Gud.
 65.  Og der kom en Frygt over alle, som boede omkring dem, og alt
      dette rygtedes over hele Judæas Bjergegn.
 66.  Og alle, som hørte det, lagde sig det på Hjerte og sagde: "Hvad
      mon der skal blive af dette Barn?" Thi Herrens Hånd var med ham.

 67.  Og Sakarias, hans Fader, blev fyldt med den Helligånd, og han
      profeterede og sagde:
 68.  "Lovet være Herren, Israels Gud! thi han har besøgt og forløst
      sit Folk
 69.  og har oprejst os et Frelsens Horn" i sin Tjener Davids Hus,
 70.  således som han talte ved sine hellige Profeters Mund fra
      fordums Tid,
 71.  en Frelse fra vore Fjender og fra alle deres Hånd, som hade os,
 72.  for at gøre Barmhjertighed imod vore Fædre og ihukomme sin
      hellige Pagt,
 73.  den Ed, som han svor vor Fader Abraham, at han vilde give os,
 74.  at vi, friede fra vore Fjenders Hånd, skulde tjene ham uden
      Frygt,
 75.  i Hellighed og Retfærdighed for hans Åsyn, alle vore Dage.
 76.  Men også du, Barnlille! skal kaldes den Højestes Profet; thi du
      skal gå foran for Herrens Åsyn for at berede hans Veje,
 77.  for at give hans Folk Erkendelse af Frelse ved deres Synders
      Forladelse,
 78.  for vor Guds inderlige Barmhjertigheds Skyld, ved hvilken Lyset
      fra det høje har besøgt os
 79.  for at skinne for dem, som sidde i Mørke og i Dødens Skygge, for
      at lede vore Fødder ind på Fredens Vej,"
 80.  Men Barnet voksede og blev styrket i Ånden; og han var i
      Ørkenerne indtil den Dag, da han trådte frem for Israel.

Lukas 2

  1.  Men det skete i de dage, at en Befaling udgik fra Kejser
      Augustus, at al Verden skulde skrives i Mandtal.
  2.  (Denne første Indskrivning skete, da Kvirinius var Landshøvding
      i Syrien,)
  3.  Og alle gik for at lade sig indskrive, hver til sin By.
  4.  Og også Josef gik op fra Galilæa, fra Byen Nazareth til Judæa
      til Davids By, som kaldes Bethlehem, fordi han var af Davids Hus
      og Slægt,
  5.  for at lade sig indskrive tillige med Maria, sin trolovede, som
      var frugtsommelig.
  6.  Men det skete, medens de vare der, blev Tiden fuldkommet til, at
      hun skulde føde.
  7.  Og hun fødte sin Søn, den førstefødte, og svøbte ham og lagde
      ham i en Krybbe; thi der var ikke Rum for dem i Herberget.

  8.  Og der var Hyrder i den samme Egn, som lå ude på Marken og holdt
      Nattevagt over deres Hjord.
  9.  Og se, en Herrens Engel stod for dem, og Herrens Herlighed
      skinnede om dem, og de frygtede såre
 10.  Og Engelen sagde til dem: "Frygter ikke; thi se, jeg forkynder
      eder en stor Glæde, som skal være for hele Folket.
 11.  Thi eder er i dag en Frelser født, som er den Herre Kristus i
      Davids By.
 12.  Og dette skulle I have til Tegn: I skulle finde et Barn svøbt,
      liggende i en Krybbe."
 13.  Og straks var der med Engelen en himmelsk Hærskares
      Mangfoldighed, som lovede Gud og sagde:
 14.  "Ære være Gud i det højeste! og Fred på Jorden! i Mennesker
      Velbehag!
 15.  Og det skete, da Englene vare farne fra dem til Himmelen, sagde
      Hyrderne til hverandre: "Lader os dog gå til Bethlehem og se
      dette, som er sket, hvilket Herren har kundgjort os."
 16.  Og de skyndte sig og kom og fandt både Maria og Josef, og Barnet
      liggende i Krybben.
 17.  Men da de så det, kundgjorde de, hvad der var talt til dem om
      dette Barn.
 18.  Og alle de, som hørte det, undrede sig over det, der blev talt
      til dem af Hyrderne.
 19.  Men Maria gemte alle disse Ord og overvejede dem i sit Hjerte.
 20.  Og Hyrderne vendte tilbage, idet de priste og lovede Gud for
      alt, hvad de havde hørt og set, således som der var talt til
      dem.

 21.  Og da otte Dage vare fuldkommede, så han skulde omskæres, da
      blev hans Navn kaldt Jesus, som det var kaldt af Engelen, før
      han blev undfangen i Moders Liv.

 22.  Og da deres Renselsesdage efter Mose Lov vare fuldkommede,
      bragte de ham op til Jerusalem for at fremstille ham for Herren,
 23.  som der er skrevet i Herrens Lov, at alt Mandkøn, som åbner
      Moders Liv, skal kaldes helligt for Herren,
 24.  og for at bringe Offer efter det, som er sagt i Herrens Lov, et
      Par Turtelduer eller to unge Duer.
 25.  Og se, der var en Mand i Jerusalem ved Navn Simeon, og denne
      Mand var retfærdig og gudfrygtig og forventede Israels Trøst, og
      den Helligånd var over ham.
 26.  Og det var varslet ham af den Helligånd, at han ikke skulde se
      Døden, førend han havde set Herrens Salvede.
 27.  Og han kom af Åndens Drift til Helligdommen; og idet Forældrene
      bragte Barnet Jesus ind for at gøre med ham efter Lovens Skik,
 28.  da tog han det på sine Arme og priste Gud og sagde:
 29.  "Herre! nu lader du din Tjener fare i Fred, efter dit Ord.
 30.  Thi mine Øjne have set din Frelse,
 31.  som du beredte for alle Folkeslagenes Åsyn,
 32.  et Lys til at oplyse Hedningerne og en Herlighed for dit Folk
      Israel."
 33.  Og hans Fader og hans Moder undrede sig over de Ting, som bleve
      sagte om ham.
 34.  Og Simeon velsignede dem og sagde til hans Moder Maria: "Se,
      denne er sat mange i Israel til Fald og Oprejsning og til et
      Tegn, som imodsiges,
 35.  ja, også din egen Sjæl skal et Sværd gennemtrænge! for at mange
      Hjerters Tanker skulle åbenbares."
 36.  Og der var en Profetinde Anna, Fanuels Datter, af Asers Stamme;
      hun var meget fremrykket i Alder, havde levet syv År med sin
      Mand efter sin Jomfrustand
 37.  og var nu en Enke ved fire og firsindstyve År, og hun veg ikke
      fra Helligdommen, tjenende Gud med Faste og Bønner Nat og Dag.
 38.  Og hun trådte til i den samme Stund og priste Gud og talte om
      ham til alle, som forventede Jerusalems Forløsning.
 39.  Og da de havde fuldbyrdet alle Ting efter Herrens Lov, vendte de
      tilbage til Galilæa til deres egen By Nazareth.
 40.  Men Barnet voksede og blev stærkt og blev fuldt af Visdom: og
      Guds Nåde var over det.

 41.  Og hans Forældre droge hvert År op til Jerusalem på
      Påskehøjtiden.
 42.  Og da han var bleven tolv År gammel, og de gik op efter
      Højtidens Sædvane
 43.  og havde tilendebragt de Dage, blev Barnet Jesus i Jerusalem,
      medens de droge hjem, og hans Forældre mærkede det ikke.
 44.  Men da de mente, at han var i Rejsefølget, kom de en Dags Rejse
      frem, og de ledte efter ham iblandt deres Slægtninge og
      Kyndinge.
 45.  Og da de ikke fandt ham, vendte de tilbage til Jerusalem og
      ledte efter ham.
 46.  Og det skete efter tre Dage, da fandt de ham i Helligdommen,
      hvor han sad midt iblandt Lærerne og både hørte på dem og
      adspurgte dem.
 47.  Men alle, som hørte ham, undrede sig såre over hans Forstand og
      Svar.
 48.  Og da de så ham, bleve de forfærdede; og hans Moder sagde til
      ham:"Barn! hvorfor gjorde du således imod os? Se, din Fader og
      jeg have ledt efter dig med Smerte."
 49.  Og han sagde til dem: "Hvorfor ledte I efter mig? Vidste I ikke,
      at jeg bør være i min Faders Gerning?"
 50.  Og de forstode ikke det Ord, som han talte til dem.
 51.  Og han drog ned med dem og kom til Nazareth og var dem lydig og
      hans Moder gemte alle de Ord i sit Hjerte.
 52.  Og Jesus forfremmedes i Visdom og Alder og yndest hos Gud og
      Mennesker.

Lukas 3

  1.  Men i Kejser Tiberius's femtende Regeringsår, da Pontius Pilatus
      var Landshøvding i Judæa, og Herodes var Fjerdingsfyrste i
      Galilæa, og hans Broder Filip var Fjerdingsfyrste i Ituræa og
      Trakonitis's Land og Lysanias Fjerdingsfyrste i Abilene,
  2.  medens Annas og Kajfas vare Ypperstepræster, kom Guds Ord til
      Johannes, Sakarias's Søn, i Ørkenen.
  3.  Og han gik ud i hele Omegnen om Jordan og prædikede
      Omvendelses-Dåb til Syndernes Forladelse,
  4.  som der er skrevet i Profeten Esajas's Talers Bog: "Der er en
      Røst af en, som råber i Ørkenen: Bereder Herrens Vej, gører hans
      Stier jævne;
  5.  hver Dal skal opfyldes, og hvert Bjerg og Høj skal nedtrykkes,
      og det krumme skal gøres lige, og de ujævne Veje skulle gøres
      jævne;
  6.  og alt Kød skal se Guds Frelse."
  7.  Han sagde altså til de Skarer, som gik ud for at døbes af ham:
      "I Øgleunger! hvem har lært eder at fly fra den kommende Vrede?
  8.  Bærer da Frugter, som ere Omvendelsen værdige, og begynder ikke
      at sige ved eder selv: Vi have Abraham til Fader; thi jeg siger
      eder, at Gud kan opvække Abraham Børn af disse Sten.
  9.  Men Øksen ligger også allerede ved Roden af Træerne; så bliver
      da hvert Træ, som ikke bærer god Frugt, omhugget og kastet i
      Ilden."
 10.  Og Skarerne spurgte ham og sagde: "Hvad skulle vi da gøre?"
 11.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Den, som har to Kjortler,
      dele med den, som ingen har; og den, som har Mad, gøre ligeså!"
 12.  Men også Toldere kom for at døbes, og de sagde til ham: "Mester!
      hvad skulle vi gøre?"
 13.  Men han sagde til dem: "Kræver intet ud over, hvad eder er
      forordnet."
 14.  Men også Krigsfolk spurgte ham og sagde: "Hvad skulle vi da
      gøre?" Og han sagde til dem: "Øver ikke Vold imod nogen, bruger
      ikke Underfundighed imod nogen, og lader eder nøje med eders
      Sold!"
 15.  Men da Folket var i Forventning, og alle tænkte i deres Hjerter
      om Johannes, om ikke han skulde være Kristus,
 16.  da svarede Johannes og sagde til alle: "Jeg døber eder med Vand;
      men den kommer, som er stærkere end jeg, og hvis Skotvinge jeg
      ikke er værdig at løse; han skal døbe eder med den Helligånd og
      Ild.
 17.  Hans Kasteskovl er i hans Hånd, for at han skal gennemrense sin
      Lo og sanke Hveden i sin Lade, men Avnerne skal han opbrænde med
      uslukkelig Ild."
 18.  Ligeså formanede han også Folket om mange andre Ting og
      forkyndte dem Evangeliet.
 19.  Men da Fjerdingsfyrsten Herodes blev revset af ham for hans
      Broders Hustru, Herodias's Skyld og for alt det onde, som
      Herodes gjorde,
 20.  så føjede han til alt det øvrige også dette, at han kastede
      Johannes i Fængsel.

 21.  Men medens hele Folket blev døbt, skete det, da også Jesus var
      bleven døbt og bad, at Himmelen åbnedes,
 22.  og at den Helligånd dalede ned over ham i legemlig Skikkelse som
      en Due, og at en Røst lød fra Himmelen: "Du er min Søn, den
      elskede, i dig har jeg Velbehag."

 23.  Og Jesus selv var omtrent tredive År, da han begyndte, og han
      var, som man holdt for, en Søn af Josef Elis Søn,
 24.  Matthats Søn, Levis Søn, Melkis Søn, Jannajs Søn, Josefs Søn,
 25.  Mattathias's Søn, Amos's Søn, Naums Søn, Eslis Søn, Naggajs Søn,
 26.  Måths Søn, Mattathias's Søn, Semeis Søn, Josefs Søn, Judas Søn,
 27.  Joanans Søn, Resas Søn, Zorobabels Søn; Salathiels Søn, Neris
      Søn.
 28.  Melkis Søn, Addis Søn, Kosams Søn, Elmadams Søn, Ers Søn,
 29.  Jesu Søn, Eliezers Søn, Jorims Søn, Matthats Søn, Levis Søn,
 30.  Simeons Søn, Judas Søn, Josets Søn, Jonams Søn, Eliakims Søn,
 31.  Meleas Søn, Mennas Søn, Mattathas Søn, Nathans Søn, Davids Søn,
 32.  Isajs Søn, Obeds Søn, Boos's Søn, Salmons Søn, Nassons Søn,

 37.  Methusalas Søn, Enoks Søn, Jareds Søn, Maleleels Søn, Kajnans
      Søn,
 38.  Enos's Søn, Seths Søn, Adams Søn, Guds Søn.

Lukas 4

  1.  Men Jesus vendte tilbage fra Jorden fuld af den Helligånd og
      blev ført af Ånden i Ørkenen
  2.  i fyrretyve Dage, medens han blev fristet af Djævelen. Og han
      spiste intet i de Dage; og da de havde Ende, blev han hungrig.
  3.  Og Djævelen sagde til ham: "Dersom du er Guds Søn, da sig til
      denne Sten, at den skal blive Brød."
  4.  Og Jesus svarede ham: "Der er skrevet: Mennesket skal ikke leve
      af Brød alene."
  5.  Og han førte ham op og viste ham alle Verdens Riger i et
      øjeblik.
  6.  Og Djævelen sagde til ham: "Dig vil jeg give hele denne Magt og
      deres Herlighed; thi den er mig overgiven, og jeg giver den, til
      hvem jeg vil.
  7.  Dersom du altså vil tilbede mig, skal den helt tilhøre dig."
  8.  Og Jesus svarede ham og sagde: "Der er skrevet: Du skal tilbede
      Herren din Gud og tjene ham alene."
  9.  Og han førte ham til Jerusalem og stillede ham på Helligdommens
      Tinde og sagde til ham: "Dersom du er Guds Søn, da kast dig ned
      herfra;
 10.  thi der er skrevet: Han skal give sine Engle Befaling om dig, at
      de skulle bevare dig,
 11.  og at de skulle bære dig på Hænderne, for at du ikke skal støde
      din Fod på nogen Sten."
 12.  Og Jesus svarede og sagde til ham: "Der er sagt: Du må ikke
      friste Herren din Gud."
 13.  Og da Djævelen havde endt al Fristelse, veg han fra ham til en
      Tid.

 14.  Og Jesus vendte i Åndens Kraft tilbage til Galilæa, og Rygtet om
      ham kom ud i hele det omliggende Land.
 15.  Og selv lærte han i deres Synagoger og blev prist af alle.
 16.  Og han kom til Nazareth, hvor han var opfødt, og gik efter sin
      Sædvane på Sabbatsdagen ind i Synagogen og stod op for at
      forelæse.
 17.  Og man gav ham Profeten Esajas's Bog, og da han slog Bogen op;
      fandt han det Sted, hvor der stod skrevet:
 18.  "Herrens Ånd er over mig, fordi han salvede mig til at forkynde
      Evangelium for fattige; han har sendt mig for at forkynde
      fangne, at de skulle lades løs, og blinde, at de skulle få deres
      Syn, for at sætte plagede i Frihed,
 19.  for at forkynde et Herrens Nådeår."
 20.  Og han lukkede Bogen sammen og gav Tjeneren den igen og satte
      sig; og alles Øjne i Synagogen stirrede på ham.
 21.  Men han begyndte at sige til dem: "I Dag er dette Skriftord gået
      i Opfyldelse for eders Øren."
 22.  Og de berømmede ham alle og undrede sig over de livsalige Ord,
      som udgik af hans Mund, og de sagde: "Er dette ikke Josefs Søn?"
 23.  Og han sagde til dem: "I ville sikkerlig sige mig dette
      Ordsprog: Læge! læg dig selv; gør også her i din Fædreneby
      så. store Ting, som vi have hørt ere skete i Kapernaum."
 24.  Men han sagde: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, at ingen Profet er
      anerkendt i sit Fædreland.
 25.  Men jeg siger eder i Sandhed: Der var mange Enker i Israel i
      Elias's Dage, da Himmelen var lukket i tre År og seks Måneder,
      den Gang der var en stor Hunger i hele Landet;
 26.  og til ingen af dem blev Elias sendt uden til Sarepta ved Sidon
      til en Enke.
 27.  Og der var mange spedalske i Israel på Profeten Elisas Tid, og
      ingen af dem blev renset, uden Syreren Naman."
 28.  Og alle, som vare i Synagogen, bleve fulde af Harme, da de hørte
      dette.
 29.  Og de stode op og stødte ham ud af Byen og førte ham hen til
      Skrænten af det Bjerg, på hvilket deres By var bygget, for at
      styrte ham ned.
 30.  Men han gik igennem, midt imellem dem, og drog bort.

 31.  Og han kom ned til Kapernaum, en By i Galilæa, og lærte dem på
      Sabbaterne.
 32.  Og de bleve slagne af Forundring over hans Lære, thi hans Tale
      var med Myndighed.
 33.  Og i Synagogen var der et Menneske, som havde en uren ond Ånd,
      og han råbte med høj Røst:
 34.  "Ak! hvad have vi med dig at gøre, Jesus af Nazareth? Er du
      kommen for at ødelægge os? Jeg kender dig, hvem du er, du Guds
      hellige."
 35.  Og Jesus truede ham og sagde: "Ti, og far ud af ham!" Og den
      onde Ånd kastede ham ind imellem dem og for ud af ham uden at
      have gjort ham nogen Skade.
 36.  Og der kom en Rædsel over alle; og de talte med hverandre og
      sagde "Hvad er dog dette for et Ord; thi han byder over de urene
      Ånder med Myndighed og Kraft, og de fare ud?"
 37.  Og Rygtet om ham udbredtes alle Vegne i det omliggende Land.

 38.  Men han stod op og gik fra Synagogen ind i Simons Hus; og Simons
      Svigermoder plagedes at en stærk Feber; og de bade ham for
      hende.
 39.  Og han stillede sig hen over hende og truede Feberen, og den
      forlod hende. Men hun stod straks op og vartede dem op.
 40.  Men da Solen gik ned, førte alle de, som havde syge med alle
      Hånde Svagheder, dem til ham; og han lagde Hænderne på hver
      enkelt af dem og helbredte dem
 41.  Også onde Ånder fore ud al mange, råbte og sagde: "Du er Guds
      Søn;" og han truede dem og tillod dem ikke at tale, fordi de
      vidste, at han var Kristus.

 42.  Men da det var blevet Dag, gik han ud og drog til et øde Sted;
      og Skarerne ledte efter ham; og de kom hen til ham, og de holdt
      på ham, for at han ikke skulde gå fra dem.
 43.  Men han sagde til dem: "Også for de andre Byer bør jeg forkynde
      Evangeliet om Guds Rige; thi dertil blev jeg udsendt."
 44.  Og han prædikede i Galilæas Synagoger.

Lukas 5

  1.  Men det skete, da Folkeskaren trængte sig sammen om ham og hørte
      Guds Ord, og han stod ved Genezareths Sø,
  2.  da så han to Skibe stå ved Søen; men Fiskerne vare gåede fra dem
      og toede Garnene.
  3.  Og han gik om Bord i et af Skibene, som var Simons, og bad ham
      at lægge lidt fra Land; og han satte sig og lærte Skarerne fra
      Skibet.
  4.  Men da han holdt op med at tale, sagde han til Simon: "Far ud på
      Dybet, og kaster eders Garn ud til en Dræt!"
  5.  Og Simon svarede og sagde til ham: "Mester! vi have arbejdet
      hele Natten og fik intet; men på dit Ord vil jeg kaste Garnene
      ud."
  6.  Og da de gjorde det, fangede de en stor Mængde Fisk, og deres
      Garn sønderreves.
  7.  Og de vinkede ad deres Staldbrødre i det andet Skib, at de
      skulde komme og hjælpe dem; og de kom og de fyldte begge
      Skibene, så at de var nær ved at synke.
  8.  Men da Simon Peter så det, faldt han ned for Jesu Knæ og sagde:
      "Gå bort fra mig, thi jeg er en syndig Mand, Herre!"
  9.  Thi en Rædsel var påkommen ham og alle dem, som vare med ham,
      over den Fiskedræt, som de havde fået;
 10.  ligeledes også Jakob og Johannes, Zebedæus's Sønner, som vare
      Simons Staldbrødre. Og Jesus sagde til Simon: "Frygt ikke, fra
      nu af skal du fange Mennesker."
 11.  Og de lagde Skibene til Land og forlode alle Ting og fulgte ham.

 12.  Og det skete, medens han var i en af Byerne, se, da var der en
      Mand fuld af Spedalskhed; og da han så Jesus, faldt han på sit
      Ansigt, bad ham og sagde: "Herre! om du vil, kan du rense mig."
 13.  Og han udrakte Hånden og rørte ved ham og sagde: "Jeg vil; bliv
      ren!" Og straks forlod Spedalskheden ham.
 14.  Og han bød ham, at han skulde ikke sige det til nogen, men "gå
      bort, og fremstil dig for Præsten, og offer for din Renselse,
      således som Moses har befalet, til Vidnesbyrd for dem!"
 15.  Men Rygtet om ham udbredte sig end mere, og store Skarer kom
      sammen for at høre og for at helbredes for deres Sygdomme.
 16.  Men han gik bort til Ørkenerne og bad.

 17.  Og det skete en af de Dage, at han lærte, og der sad Farisæere
      og Lovlærere, som vare komne fra enhver Landsby i Galilæa og
      Judæa og fra Jerusalem; og Herrens Kraft var hos ham til at
      helbrede.
 18.  Og se, nogle Mænd bare på en Seng en Mand, som var værkbruden,
      og de søgte at bære ham ind og lægge ham foran ham.
 19.  Og da de ikke fandt nogen Vej til at bære ham ind for Skarens
      Skyld, stege de op oven på Taget og firede ham tillige med
      Sengen ned imellem Tagstenene midt iblandt dem foran Jesus.
 20.  Og da han så deres Tro, sagde han: "Menneske! dine Synder ere
      dig forladte."
 21.  Og de skriftkloge og Farisæerne begyndte at tænke således ved
      sig selv: "Hvem er denne, som taler Gudsbespottelser? Hvem kan
      forlade Synder, uden Gud alene?"
 22.  Men da Jesus kendte deres Tanker, svarede han og sagde til dem:
      "Hvad tænke I på i eders Hjerter?
 23.  Hvilket er lettest at sige: Dine Synder ere dig forladte? eller
      at sige: Stå op og gå?
 24.  Men for at I skulle vide, at Menneskesønnen har Magt på Jorden
      til at forlade Synder," så sagde han til den værkbrudne: "Jeg
      siger dig, stå op, og tag din Seng, og gå til dit Hus!"
 25.  Og han stod straks op for deres Øjne og tog det, som han lå på,
      og gik hen til sit Hus og priste Gud.
 26.  Og Forfærdelse betog alle, og de priste Gud; og de bleve fulde
      af Frygt og sagde: "Vi have i Dag set utrolige Ting."

 27.  Og derefter gik han ud og så en Tolder ved Navn Levi sidde ved
      Toldboden, og han sagde til ham: "Følg mig!"
 28.  Og han forlod alle Ting og stod op og fulgte ham.
 29.  Og Levi gjorde et stort Gæstebud for ham i sit Hus; og der var
      en stor Skare af Toldere og andre, som sade til Bords med dem.
 30.  Og Farisæerne og deres Skriftkloge knurrede imod hans Disciple
      og sagde: "Hvorfor spise og drikke I med Toldere og Syndere?"
 31.  Og Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "De raske trænge ikke til
      Læge, men de syge.
 32.  Jeg er ikke kommen for at kalde retfærdige, men Syndere til
      Omvendelse."

 33.  Men de sagde til ham: "Johannes's Disciple faste ofte og holde
      Bønner og Farisæernes ligeså; men dine spise og drikke?"
 34.  Men Jesus sagde til dem: "Kunne I vel få Brudesvendene til at
      faste, så længe Brudgommen er hos dem?
 35.  Men der skal komme Dage, da Brudgommen bliver tagen fra dem; da
      skulle de faste i de Dage."
 36.  Men han sagde også en Lignelse til dem: "Ingen river en Lap af
      et nyt Klædebon og sætter den på et gammelt Klædebon; ellers
      river han både det nye sønder, og Lappen fra det nye vil ikke
      passe til det gamle.
 37.  Og ingen kommer ung Vin på gammle Læderflasker; ellers sprænger
      den unge Vin Læderflaskerne, og den spildes, og Læderflaskerne
      ødelægges.
 38.  Men man skal komme ung Vin på nye Læderflasker, så blive de
      begge bevarede.
 39.  Og ingen, som har drukket den gamle, vil have den unge; thi han
      siger: Den gamle er god."

Lukas 6

  1.  Men det skete på den næstførste Sabbat, at han vandrede igennem
      en Sædemark, og hans Disciple plukkede Aks og gned dem med
      Hænderne og spiste.
  2.  Men nogle af Farisæerne sagde: "Hvorfor gøre I, hvad det ikke er
      tilladt at gøre på Sabbaten?"
  3.  Og Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Have I da ikke læst, hvad
      David gjorde, da han blev hungrig, han og de, som vare med ham?
  4.  hvorledes han gik ind i Guds Hus og tog Skuebrødene og spiste og
      gav også dem, som vare med ham, skønt det ikke er nogen tilladt
      at spise dem uden Præsterne alene."
  5.  Og han sagde til dem: "Menneskesønnen er Herre også over
      Sabbaten."

  6.  Men det skete på en anden Sabbat, at han kom ind i Synagogen og
      lærte. Og der var der en Mand, hvis højre Hånd var vissen.
  7.  Men de skriftkloge og Farisæerne toge Vare på ham, om han vilde
      helbrede på Sabbaten, for at de kunde finde noget at anklage ham
      for.
  8.  Men han vidste deres Tanker; og han sagde til Manden, som havde
      den visne Hånd: "Rejs dig og stå frem her i Midten!" Og han
      rejste sig og stod frem.
  9.  Men Jesus sagde til dem: "Jeg spørger eder, om det er tilladt at
      gøre godt på Sabbaten eller at gøre ondt, at frelse Liv eller at
      ødelægge det?"
 10.  Og han så omkring på dem alle og sagde til ham: "Ræk din Hånd
      ud!" Og han gjorde det; da blev hans Hånd sund igen som den
      anden.
 11.  Men de bleve fulde af Raseri og talte med hverandre om, hvad de
      skulde gøre ved Jesus.

 12.  Men det skete i disse Dage, at han gik ud på et Bjerg for at
      bede; og han tilbragte Natten i Bøn til Gud.
 13.  Og da det blev Dag, hidkaldte han sine Disciple og udvalgte tolv
      af dem, hvilke han også kaldte Apostle:
 14.  Simon, hvem han også kaldte Peter, og Andreas, hans Broder, og
      Jakob og Johannes og Filip og Bartholomæus
 15.  og Matthæus og Thomas, Jakob, Alfæus's Søn, og Simon, som kaldes
      Zelotes,
 16.  Judas, Jakobs Søn, og Judas Iskariot, som blev Forræder.

 17.  Og han gik ned med dem og stod på et jævnt Sted, og der var en
      Skare af hans Disciple og en stor Mængde af Folket fra hele
      Judæa og Jerusalem og Kysten ved Tyrus og Sidon,
 18.  som vare komne for at høre ham og helbredes for deres Sygdomme.
      Og de plagede bleve helbredte fra urene Ånder;
 19.  og hele Skaren søgte at røre ved ham; thi en Kraft gik ud fra
      ham og helbredte alle.

 20.  Og han opløftede sine Øjne på sine Disciple og sagde: "Salige
      ere I fattige, thi eders er Guds Rige.
 21.  Salige ere I, som nu hungre, thi I skulle mættes. Salige ere I,
      som nu græde, thi I skulle le.
 22.  Salige er I, når Menneskene hade eder, og når de udstøde eder og
      håne eder og forkaste eders Navn som ondt for Menneskesønnens
      Skyld.
 23.  Glæder eder på den Dag og jubler; thi se, eders Løn er stor i
      Himmelen. Thi på samme Måde gjorde deres Fædre ved Profeterne.
 24.  Men ve eder, I rige, thi I have allerede fået eders Trøst.
 25.  Ve eder, I, som nu ere mætte, thi I skulle hungre. Ve eder, I,
      som nu le, thi I skulle sørge og græde.
 26.  Ve eder, når alle Mennesker tale godt om eder; thi på samme Måde
      gjorde deres Fædre ved de falske Profeter.

 27.  Men jeg siger eder, I, som høre: Elsker eders Fjender, gører dem
      godt, som hade eder;
 28.  velsigner dem, som forbande eder, og beder for dem, som krænke
      eder.
 29.  Den, som slår dig på den ene Kind, byd ham også den anden til;
      og den, som tager Kappen fra dig, formen ham heller ikke
      Kjortelen!
 30.  Giv enhver, som beder dig; og af den, som tager, hvad dit er,
      kræve du det ikke igen!
 31.  Og som I ville, at Menneskene skulle gøre imod eder, ligeså
      skulle også I gøre imod dem!
 32.  Og dersom I elske dem, som elske eder, hvad Tak have I derfor?
      Thi også Syndere elske dem, som dem elske.
 33.  Og dersom I gøre vel imod dem, der gøre vel imod eder, hvad Tak
      have I derfor? Thi også Syndere gøre det samme.
 34.  Og dersom I låne dem, af hvem I håbe at få igen, hvad Tak have I
      derfor? Thi også Syndere låne Syndere for at få lige igen.
 35.  Men elsker eders Fjender, og gører vel, og låner uden at vente
      noget derfor, så skal eders Løn være stor, og I skulle være den
      Højestes Børn; thi han er god imod de utaknemmelige og onde.
 36.  Vorder barmhjertige, ligesom eders Fader er barmhjertig.

 37.  Og dømmer ikke, så skulle I ikke dømmes; fordømmer ikke, så
      skulle I ikke fordømmes; forlader, så skal der forlades eder;
 38.  giver, så skal der gives eder. Et godt, knuget, rystet, topfuldt
      Mål skulle de give i eders Skød; thi med hvad Mål I måle, skal
      der tilmåles eder igen."
 39.  Men han sagde dem også en Lignelse: "Mon en blind kan lede en
      blind? Ville de ikke begge falde i Graven?
 40.  En Discipel er ikke over sin Mester; men enhver, som er fuldt
      færdig, skal være som sin Mester.
 41.  Men hvorfor ser du Skæven, som er i din Broders Øje; men
      Bjælken, som er i dit eget Øje, bliver du ikke var?
 42.  Eller hvorledes kan du sige til din Broder: Broder! lad mig
      drage Skæven ud, som er i dit Øje, du, som ikke ser Bjælken i
      dit eget Øje?  Du Hykler! drag først Bjælken ud af dit Øje, og
      da kan du se klart til at drage Skæven ud, som er i din Broders
      Øje.

 43.  Thi der er intet godt Træ, som bærer rådden Frugt, og intet
      råddent Træ, som bærer god Frugt
 44.  Thi hvert Træ kendes på sin egen Frugt; thi man sanker ikke
      Figener af Torne, ikke heller plukker man Vindruer af en
      Tornebusk.
 45.  Et godt Menneske fremfører det gode af sit Hjertes gode Forråd,
      og et ondt Menneske fremfører det onde af sit onde Forråd; thi
      af Hjertets Overflødighed taler hans Mund.

 46.  Men hvorfor kalde I mig Herre, Herre! og gøre ikke, hvad jeg
      siger?
 47.  Hver den, som kommer til mig og hører mine Ord og gør efter dem,
      hvem han er lig, skal jeg vise eder.
 48.  Han er lig et Menneske, der byggede et Hus og gravede i Dybden
      og lagde Grundvolden på Klippen; men da en Oversvømmelse kom,
      styrtede Floden imod det Hus, og den kunde ikke ryste det; thi
      det var bygget godt.
 49.  Men den, som hører og ikke gør derefter, han er lig et Menneske,
      der byggede et Hus på Jorden, uden Grundvold; og Floden styrtede
      imod det, og det faldt straks sammen, og dette Hus's Fald blev
      stort."

Lukas 7

  1.  Men da han havde fuldendt alle sine Ord i Folkets Påhør, gik han
      ind i Kapernaum.
  2.  Men en Høvedsmands Tjener, som denne holdt meget af, var syg og
      nær ved at dø.
  3.  men da han hørte om Jesus, sendte han nogle af Jødernes Ældste
      til ham og bad ham om, at han vilde komme og helbrede hans
      Tjener.
  4.  Men da de kom til Jesus, bade de ham indtrængende og sagde: "Han
      er vel værd, at du gør dette for ham;
  5.  thi han elsker vort Folk, og han har bygget Synagogen for os."
  6.  Og Jesus gik med dem. Men da han allerede ikke var langt fra
      Huset, sendte Høvedsmanden nogle Venner og lod ham sige: "Herre!
      umag dig ikke; thi jeg er ikke værdig til, at du skal gå ind
      under mit Tag.
  7.  Derfor agtede jeg heller ikke mig selv værdig til at komme til
      dig; men sig det med et Ord, så bliver min Dreng helbredt.
  8.  Jeg er jo selv et Menneske, som står under Øvrighed og har
      Stridsmænd under mig; og siger jeg til den ene: Gå! så går han;
      og til den anden: Kom! så kommer han; og til min Tjener: Gør
      dette!  så gør han det."
  9.  Men da Jesus hørte dette, forundrede han sig over ham; og han
      vendte sig om og sagde til Skaren, som fulgte ham: "Jeg siger
      eder, end ikke i Israel har jeg fundet så stor en Tro."
 10.  Og da de, som vare udsendte, kom tilbage til Huset, fandt de den
      syge Tjener sund.

 11.  Og det skete Dagen derefter, at han gik til en By, som hed Nain,
      og der gik mange af hans Disciple og en stor Skare med ham.
 12.  Men da han nærmede sig Byens Port, se, da blev en død båren ud,
      som var sin Moders enbårne Søn, og hun var Enke; og en stor
      Skare fra Byen gik med hende.
 13.  Og da Herren så hende, ynkedes han inderligt over hende og sagde
      til hende: "Græd ikke!"
 14.  Og han trådte til og rørte ved Båren; men de, som bare, stode
      stille, og han sagde: "du unge Mand, jeg siger dig, stå op!"
 15.  Og den døde rejste sig op og begyndte at tale; og han gav ham
      til hans Moder.
 16.  Men Frygt betog alle, og de priste Gud og sagde: "Der er en stor
      Profet oprejst iblandt os, og Gud har besøgt sit Folk."
 17.  Og denne Tale om ham kom ud i hele Judæa og i hele det
      omliggende Land.

 18.  Og Johannes's Disciple fortalte ham om alt dette. Og Johannes
      kaldte to af sine Disciple til sig
 19.  og sendte dem til Herren og lod sige: "Er du den, som kommer,
      eller skulle vi vente en anden?"
 20.  Og da Mændene kom til ham, sagde de: "Johannes Døberen har sendt
      os til dig og lader sige: Er du den, som kommer, eller skulle vi
      vente en anden?"
 21.  I den samme Time helbredte han mange for Sygdomme og Plager og
      onde Ånder og skænkede mange blinde Synet.
 22.  Og han svarede og sagde til dem: "Går hen, og forkynder Johannes
      de Ting, som I have set og hørt: Blinde se, lamme gå, spedalske
      renses, døve høre, døde stå op, Evangeliet forkyndes for
      fattige;
 23.  og salig er den, som ikke forarges på mig."
 24.  Men da Johannes's Sendebud vare gåede bort, begyndte han at sige
      til Skarerne om Johannes: "Hvad gik I ud i Ørkenen at skue? Et
      Rør, som bevæges hid og did af Vinden?
 25.  Eller hvad gik I ud at se? Et Menneske, iført bløde Klæder? Se,
      de, som leve i prægtige Klæder og i Vellevned, ere i
      Kongsgårdene.
 26.  Eller hvad gik I ud at se? En Profet? Ja, siger jeg eder, endog
      mere end en Profet!
 27.  Han er den, om hvem der er skrevet: Se, jeg sender min Engel for
      dit Ansigt, han skal berede din Vej foran dig.
 28.  Jeg siger eder: Iblandt dem, som ere fødte af Kvinder, er ingen
      større Profet end Johannes; men den mindste i Guds Rige er
      større end han.
 29.  Og hele Folket, som hørte ham, endog Tolderne, gav Gud Ret, idet
      de bleve døbte med Johannes's Dåb.
 30.  Men Farisæerne og de lovkyndige have foragtet Guds Råd med dem
      selv, idet de ikke bleve døbte af ham.

 31.  Ved hvem skal jeg da ligne denne Slægts Mennesker? og hvem ligne
      de?
 32.  De ligne Børn, som sidde på Torvet og råbe til hverandre og
      sige: Vi blæste på Fløjte for eder, og I dansede ikke, vi sang
      Klagesange for eder, og I græd ikke.
 33.  Thi Johannes Døberen kom, som hverken spiste Brød eller drak
      Vin, og I sige: Han er besat.
 34.  Menneskesønnen kom, som spiser og drikker, og I sige: Se, en
      Frådser og en Vindranker, Tolderes og Synderes Ven!
 35.  Dog Visdommen er retfærdiggjort ved alle sine Børn!"

 36.  Men en af Farisæerne bad ham om, at han vilde spise med ham; og
      han gik ind i Farisæerens Hus og satte sig til Bords.
 37.  Og se, der var en Kvinde, som var en Synderinde i Byen; da hun
      fik at vide, at han sad til Bords i Farisæerens Hus, kom hun med
      en Alabastkrukke med Salve;
 38.  og hun stillede sig bag ved ham, ved hans Fødder og græd og
      begyndte at væde hans Fødder med sine Tårer og aftørrede dem med
      sit Hovedhår og kyssede hans Fødder og salvede dem med Salven.
 39.  Men da Farisæeren, som havde indbudt ham, så det, sagde han ved
      sig selv: "Dersom denne var en Profet, vidste han, hvem og
      hvordan en Kvinde denne er, som rører ved ham, at hun er en
      Synderinde."
 40.  Og Jesus tog til Orde og sagde til ham: "Simon! jeg har noget at
      sige dig." Men han siger: "Mester, sig frem!"
 41.  "En Mand, som udlånte Penge, havde to Skyldnere; den ene var fem
      Hundrede Denarer skyldig. men den anden halvtredsindstyve.
 42.  Da de ikke havde noget at betale med, eftergav han dem det
      begge.  Hvem af dem vil nu elske ham mest?"
 43.  Simon svarede og sagde: "Jeg holder for, den, hvem han eftergav
      mest?" Men han sagde til ham: "Du dømte ret."
 44.  Og han vendte sig imod Kvinden og sagde til Simon: "Ser du denne
      Kvinde? Jeg kom ind i dit Hus; du gav mig ikke Vand til mine
      Fødder; men hun vædede mine Fødder med sine Tårer og aftørrede
      dem med sit Hår.
 45.  Du gav mig intet Kys; men hun ophørte ikke med at kysse mine
      Fødder, fra jeg kom herind.
 46.  Du salvede ikke mit Hoved med Olie; men hun salvede mine Fødder
      med Salve.
 47.  Derfor siger jeg dig: Hendes mange Synder ere hende forladte,
      eftersom hun elskede meget; men den, hvem lidet forlades, elsker
      lidet."
 48.  Men han sagde til hende: "Dine Synder ere forladte!"
 49.  Og de, som sade til Bords med ham, begyndte at sige ved sig
      selv: "Hvem er denne, som endog forlader Synder?"
 50.  Men han sagde til Kvinden: "Din Tro har frelst dig, gå bort med
      Fred!"

Lukas 8

  1.  Og det skete i Tiden der efter, at han rejste igennem Byer og
      Landsbyer og prædikede og forkyndte Evangeliet om Guds Rige, og
      med ham de tolv
  2.  og nogle Kvinder, som vare helbredte fra onde Ånder og Sygdomme,
      nemlig: Maria, der kaldes Magdalene, af hvem syv onde Ånder vare
      udfarne;
  3.  og Johanna, Herodes's Husfoged Kuzas Hustru, og Susanna og mange
      andre, som tjente dem med, hvad de ejede.

  4.  Men da en stor Skare kom sammen, og de droge til ham fra de
      forskellige Byer, sagde han ved en Lignelse:
  5.  "En Sædemand gik ud at så sin Sæd; og idet han såede, faldt
      noget ved Vejen og blev nedtrådt, og Himmelens Fugle åde det op.
  6.  Og noget faldt på Klippen; og da det voksede op, visnede det,
      fordi det ikke havde Væde.
  7.  Og noget faldt midt iblandt Torne, og Tornene voksede op med og
      kvalte det.
  8.  Og noget faldt i den gode Jord, og det voksede op og bar
      hundrede Fold Frugt." Da han sagde dette, råbte han: "Den, som
      har Øren at høre med, han høre!"

  9.  Men hans Disciple spurgte ham, hvad denne Lignelse skulde
      betyde.
 10.  Og han sagde: "Eder er det givet at kende Guds Riges
      Hemmeligheder, men de andre i Lignelser, for at de, skønt
      seende, ikke skulle se, og, skønt hørende, ikke skulle forstå.

 11.  Men dette er Lignelsen: Sæden er Guds Ord.
 12.  Men de ved Vejen ere de, som høre det; derefter kommer Djævelen
      og tager Ordet bort af deres Hjerte, for at de ikke skulle tro
      og blive frelste.
 13.  Men de på Klippen ere de, som modtage Ordet med Glæde, når de
      høre det, og disse have ikke Rod; de tro til en Tid og falde fra
      i Fristelsens Tid.
 14.  Men det, som faldt iblandt Torne, det er dem, som have hørt og
      så gå hen og kvæles under Livets Bekymringer og Rigdom og
      Nydelser og ikke bære moden Frugt.
 15.  Men det i den gode Jord, det er dem, som, når de have hørt
      Ordet, beholde det i et smukt og godt Hjerte og bære Frugt i
      Udholdenhed.

 16.  Men ingen, som tænder et Lys, skjuler det med et Kar eller
      sætter det under en Bænk; men han sætter det på en Lysestage,
      for at de, som komme ind, kunne se Lyset.
 17.  Thi der er ikke noget skjult, som jo skal blive åbenbart; og
      ikke noget lønligt, som jo skal blive kendt og komme for Lyset.
 18.  Ser derfor til, hvorledes I høre; thi den, som har, ham skal der
      gives; og den, som ikke har, fra ham skal endog det tages, han
      synes at have."

 19.  Men hans Moder og Brødre kom til ham og kunde ikke nå frem til
      ham for Skaren.
 20.  Og det blev ham meddelt: "Din Moder og dine Brødre stå udenfor
      og begære at se dig."
 21.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Min Moder og mine Brødre ere
      disse, som høre Guds Ord og gøre efter det."

 22.  Og det skete en af de Dage, at han gik om Bord i et Skib tillige
      med sine Disciple, og han sagde til dem: "Lader os fare over til
      hin Side af Søen;" og de sejlede ud.
 23.  Men medens de sejlede, faldt han i Søvn; og en Stormvind for ned
      over Søen, og Skibet blev fuldt af Vand, og de vare i Fare.
 24.  Da trådte de hen og vækkede ham og sagde: "Mester, Mester! vi
      forgå." Men han stod op og truede Vinden og Vandets Bølger; og
      de lagde sig, og det blev blikstille.
 25.  Og han sagde til dem: "Hvor, er eders Tro?" Men de frygtede og
      undrede sig, og sagde til hverandre: "Hvem er dog denne, siden
      han byder både over Vindene og Vandet, og de ere ham lydige?"

 26.  Og de sejlede ind til Gadarenernes Land, som ligger lige over
      for Galilæa.
 27.  Men da han trådte ud på Landjorden, mødte der ham en Mand fra
      Byen, som i lang Tid havde været besat af onde Ånder og ikke
      havde haft Klæder på og ikke opholdt sig i Hus, men i Gravene.
 28.  Men da han så Jesus, råbte han og faldt ned for ham og sagde med
      høj Røst: "Hvad har jeg med dig at gøre, Jesus, den højeste Guds
      Søn?  jeg beder dig om, at du ikke vil pine mig."
 29.  Thi han bød den urene Ånd at fare ud af Manden; thi i lange
      Tider havde den revet ham med sig, og han blev bunden med Lænker
      og Bøjer og bevogtet, og han sønderrev, hvad man bandt ham med,
      og dreves af den onde Ånd ud i Ørkenerne.
 30.  Men Jesus spurgte ham og sagde: "Hvad er dit Navn?" Men han
      sagde: "Leion"; thi mange onde Ånder vare farne i ham.
 31.  Og de bade ham om at han ikke vilde byde dem at fare ned i
      Afgrunden;
 32.  men der var sammesteds en stor Hjord Svin, som græssede på
      Bjerget; og de bade ham om, at han vilde tilstede dem at fare i
      dem; og han tilstedte dem det.
 33.  Men de onde Ånder fore ud at Manden og fore i Svinene, og
      Hjorden styrtede sig ned over Brinken ud i Søen og druknede.
 34.  Men da Hyrderne så det, som var sket, flyede de og forkyndte det
      i Byen og på Landet.
 35.  Da gik de ud for af se det, som var sket, og de kom til Jesus og
      fandt Manden, af hvem de onde Ånder vare udfarne, siddende ved
      Jesu Fødder, påklædt og ved Samling; og de frygtede.
 36.  Og de, som havde set det, fortalte dem, hvorledes den besatte
      var bleven frelst.
 37.  Og hele Mængden fra Gadarenernes Omegn bad ham om, at han vilde
      gå bort fra dem; thi de vare betagne af stor Frygt. Men han gik
      om Bord i et Skib og vendte tilbage igen.
 38.  Men Manden, af hvem de onde Ånder vare udfarne, bad ham om, at
      han måtte være hos ham; men han lod ham fare og sagde:
 39.  "Vend tilbage til dit Hus, og fortæl, hvor store Ting Gud har
      gjort imod dig." Og han gik bort og kundgjorde over hele Byen,
      hvor store Ting Jesus havde gjort imod ham.

 40.  Men det skete, da Jesus kom tilbage, tog Skaren imod ham; thi de
      ventede alle på ham.
 41.  Og se, det kom en Mand, som hed Jairus, og han var Forstander
      for Synagogen; og han faldt ned for Jesu Fødder og bad ham komme
      ind i hans Hus;
 42.  thi han havde en enbåren Datter, omtrent tolv År gammel, og hun
      droges med Døden. Men idet han gik, trængte Skarerne sig sammen
      om ham.
 43.  Og en Kvinde, som havde haft Blodflod i tolv År og havde kostet
      al sin Formue på Læger og ikke kunde blive helbredt af nogen,
 44.  hun gik til bagfra og rørte ved Fligen af hans Klædebon, og
      straks standsedes hendes Blodflod.
 45.  Og Jesus sagde: "Hvem var det, som rørte ved mig?" Men da alle
      nægtede det, sagde Peter og de, som vare med ham: "Mester!
      Skarerne trykke og trænge dig, og du siger: Hvem var det, som
      rørte ved mig?"
 46.  Men Jesus sagde: "Der rørte nogen ved mig; thi jeg mærkede, at
      der udgik en Kraft fra mig."
 47.  Men da Kvinden så, at det ikke var skjult, kom hun bævende og
      faldt ned for ham og fortalte i alt Folkets Påhør, af hvad Årsag
      hun havde rørt ved ham, og hvorledes hun straks var bleven
      helbredt.
 48.  Men han sagde til hende: "Datter! din Tro har frelst dig; gå
      bort med Fred!"
 49.  Medens han endnu talte, kommer der en fra Synagogeforstanderens
      Hus og siger til ham: "Din Datter er død; umag ikke Mesteren!"
 50.  Men da Jesus hørte det, svarede han ham: "Frygt ikke; tro blot;
      så skal hun blive frelst."
 51.  Men da han kom til Huset, tillod han ingen at gå ind med sig
      uden Peter og Johannes og Jakob og Pigens Fader og Moder.
 52.  Og de græd alle og holdt Veklage over hende; men han sagde:
      "Græder ikke; hun er ikke død, men sover."
 53.  Og de lo ad ham; thi de vidste, at hun var død.
 54.  Men han greb hendes Hånd og råbte og sagde: "Pige, stå op!"
 55.  Og hendes Ånd vendte tilbage, og hun stod straks op; og han
      befalede, at de skulde give hende noget at spise.
 56.  Og hendes Forældre bleve forfærdede; men han bød dem, at de ikke
      måtte sige nogen det, som var sket.

Lukas 9

  1.  Men han sammenkaldte de tolv og gav dem Magt og Myndighed over
      alle de onde Ånder og til at helbrede Sygdomme.
  2.  Og han sendte dem ud for at prædike Guds Rige og helbrede de
      syge.
  3.  Og han sagde til dem: "Tager intet med på Vejen, hverken Stav
      eller Taske eller Brød eller Penge, ej heller skal nogen have to
      Kjortler.
  4.  Og hvor I komme ind i et Hus, der skulle I blive og derfra drage
      bort.
  5.  Og hvor som helst de ikke modtage eder, fra den By skulle I gå
      ud og endog ryste Støvet af eders Fødder til Vidnesbyrd imod
      dem."
  6.  Men de gik ud og droge fra Landsby til Landsby, idet de
      forkyndte Evangeliet og helbredte alle Vegne.

  7.  Men Fjerdingsfyrsten Herodes hørte alt det, som skete; og han
      var tvivlrådig, fordi nogle sagde, at Johannes var oprejst fra
      de døde;
  8.  men nogle, at Elias havde vist sig; men andre, at en af de gamle
      Profeter var opstanden.
  9.  Men Herodes sagde: "Johannes har jeg ladet halshugge; men hvem
      er denne, om hvem jeg hører sådanne Ting?" Og han søgte at få
      ham at se.

 10.  Og Apostlene kom tilbage og fortalte ham, hvor store Ting de
      havde gjort. Og han tog dem med sig og drog bort afsides til en
      By, som kaldes Bethsajda.
 11.  Men da Skarerne fik det at vide, fulgte de efter ham; og han tog
      imod dem og talte til dem om Guds Rige og helbredte dem, som
      trængte til Lægedom.
 12.  Men Dagen begyndte at hælde. Og de tolv kom hen og sagde til
      ham: "Lad Skaren gå bort, for at de kunne gå herfra til de
      omliggende Landsbyer og Gårde og få Herberge og finde Føde; thi
      her ere vi på et øde Sted."
 13.  Men han sagde til dem: "Giver I dem at spise!"Men de sagde: "Vi
      have ikke mere end fem Brød og to Fisk, med mindre vi skulle gå
      bort og købe Mad til hele denne Mængde."
 14.  De vare nemlig omtrent fem Tusinde Mænd. Men han sagde til sine
      Disciple: "Lader dem sætte sig ned i Hobe, halvtredsindstyve i
      hver."
 15.  Og de gjorde så og lode dem alle sætte sig ned.
 16.  Men han tog de fem Brød og de to Fisk, så op til Himmelen og
      velsignede dem, og han brød dem og gav sine Disciple dem at
      lægge dem for Skaren.
 17.  Og de spiste og bleve alle mætte; og det, som de fik tilovers af
      Stykker, blev opsamlet, tolv Kurve.

 18.  Og det skete, medens han bad, vare hans Disciple alene hos ham;
      og han spurgte dem og sagde: "Hvem sige Skarerne, at jeg er?"
 19.  Men de svarede og sagde: "Johannes Døberen; men andre: Elias;
      men andre: En af de gamle Profeter er opstanden."
 20.  Og han sagde til dem: "Men I hvem sige I, at jeg er?" Og Peter
      svarede og sagde: "Guds Kristus."
 21.  Men han bød dem strengt ikke at sige dette til nogen,
 22.  idet han sagde: "Menneskesønnen skal lide meget og forkastes af
      de Ældste og Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge og ihjelslås og
      oprejses på den tredje Dag."

 23.  Men han sagde til alle: "Vil nogen komme efter mig, han fornægte
      sig selv og tage sit Kors op daglig og følge mig;
 24.  thi den, som vil frelse sit Liv. skal miste det; men den, som
      mister sit Liv for min Skyld, han skal frelse det.
 25.  Thi hvad gavner det et Menneske, om han har vundet den hele
      Verden, men mistet sig selv eller bødet med sig selv?
 26.  Thi den, som skammer sig ved mig og mine Ord, ved ham skal
      Menneskesønnen skamme sig, når han kommer i sin og Faderens og
      de hellige Engles Herlighed.
 27.  Men sandelig, siger jeg eder: Der er nogle af dem, som stå her.
      der ingenlunde skulle smage Døden. førend de se Guds Rige."

 28.  Men det skete omtrent otte Dage efter denne Tale, at han tog
      Peter og Johannes og Jakob med sig og gik op på Bjerget for at
      bede.
 29.  Og det skete, medens han bad, da blev hans Ansigts Udseende
      anderledes, og hans Klædebon blev hvidt og strålende.
 30.  Og se, to Mænd talte med ham, og det var Moses og Elias,
 31.  som bleve set i Herlighed og talte om hans Udgang, som han
      skulde fuldbyrde i Jerusalem.
 32.  Men Peter og de, som vare med ham, vare betyngede af Søvn; men
      da de vågnede op, så de hans Herlighed og de to Mænd, som stode
      hos ham.
 33.  Og det skete, da disse skiltes fra ham, sagde Peter til Jesus:
      "Mester! det er godt, at vi ere her; og lader os gøre tre
      Hytter, en til dig og en til Moses og en til Elias;" men han
      vidste ikke, hvad han sagde.
 34.  Men idet han sagde dette, kom en Sky og overskyggede dem; men de
      frygtede, da de kom ind i Skyen.
 35.  Og der kom fra Skyen en Røst, som sagde: "Denne er min Søn, den
      udvalgte, hører ham!"
 36.  Og da Røsten kom, blev Jesus funden alene. Og de tav og
      forkyndte i de Dage ingen noget af det, de havde set.

 37.  Men det skete Dagen derefter, da de kom ned fra Bjerget, at der
      mødte ham en stor Skare.
 38.  Og se, en Mand af Skaren råbte og sagde: "Mester! jeg beder dig,
      se til min Søn: thi han er min enbårne.
 39.  Og se, en Ånd griber ham, og pludseligt skriger han, og den
      slider i ham, så at han fråder, og med Nød viger den fra ham,
      idet den mishandler ham;
 40.  og jeg bad dine Disciple om at uddrive den; og de kunde ikke."
 41.  Men Jesus svarede og sagde: "O du vantro og forvendte Slægt!
      hvor længe skal jeg være hos eder og tåle eder? Bring din Søn
      hid!"
 42.  Men endnu medens han gik derhen, rev og sled den onde Ånd i ham.
      Men Jesus truede den urene Ånd og helbredte drengen og gav hans
      Fader ham tilbage.
 43.  Men de bleve alle slagne af Forundring over Guds Majestæt. Men
      da alle undrede sig over alt det, han gjorde, sagde han til sine
      Disciple:

 44.  "Gemmer i eders Øren disse Ord: Menneskesønnen skal overgives i
      Menneskers Hænder."
 45.  Men de forstode ikke dette Ord, og det var skjult for dem, så de
      ikke begreb det, og de frygtede for at spørge ham om dette Ord.

 46.  Men der opstod den Tanke hos dem, hvem der vel var den største
      af dem.
 47.  Men da Jesus så deres Hjertes Tanke, tog, han et Barn og
      stillede det hos sig.
 48.  Og han sagde til dem: "Den, som modtager dette Barn for mit
      Navns Skyld, modtager mig; og den, som modtager mig, modtager
      den, som udsendte mig; thi den, som er den mindste iblandt eder
      alle, han er stor."

 49.  Men Johannes tog til Orde og sagde: "Mester! vi så en uddrive
      onde Ånder i dit Navn; og vi forbød ham det, fordi han ikke
      følger med os."
 50.  Men Jesus sagde til ham: "Forbyder ham det ikke; thi den, som
      ikke er imod eder, er for eder."

 51.  Men det skete, da hans Optagelses Dage vare ved at fuldkommes,
      da fæstede han sit Ansigt på at drage til Jerusalem.
 52.  Og han sendte Sendebud forud for sig; og de gik og kom ind i en
      Samaritanerlandsby for at berede ham Herberge.
 53.  Og de modtoge ham ikke, fordi han var på Vejen til Jerusalem.
 54.  Men da hans Disciple, Jakob og Johannes, så det, sagde de:
      "Herre!  vil du, at vi skulle byde Ild fare ned fra Himmelen og
      fortære dem, ligesom også Elias gjorde?"
 55.  Men han vendte sig og irettesatte dem.
 56.  Og de gik til en anden Landsby.

 57.  Og medens de vandrede på Vejen, sagde en til ham: "Jeg vil følge
      dig, hvor du end går hen."
 58.  Og Jesus sagde til ham: "Ræve have Huler, og Himmelens Fugle
      Reder; men Menneskesønnen har ikke det, hvortil han kan hælde
      sit Hoved."
 59.  Men han sagde til en anden: "Følg mig!" Men denne sagde: "Herre!
      tilsted mig først at gå hen at begrave min Fader."
 60.  Men han sagde til ham: "Lad de døde begrave deres døde; men gå
      du hen og forkynd Guds Rige!"
 61.  Men også en anden sagde: "Herre! jeg vil følge dig; men tilsted
      mig først at tage Afsked med dem, som ere i mit Hus."
 62.  Men Jesus sagde til ham: "Ingen, som lægger sin Hånd på Ploven
      og ser tilbage, er vel skikket for Guds Rige."

Lukas 10

  1.  Men derefter udvalgte Herren også halvfjerdsindstyve andre og
      sendte dem ud to og to forud for sig, til hver By og hvert Sted,
      hvorhen han selv vilde komme.
  2.  Og han sagde til dem: "Høsten er stor, men Arbejderne ere få;
      beder derfor Høstens Herre om, at han vil sende Arbejdere ud til
      sin Høst.
  3.  Går ud! Se, jeg sender eder som Lam midt iblandt Ulve.
  4.  Bærer ikke Pung, ikke Taske, ej heller Sko; og hilser ingen på
      Vejen!
  5.  Men hvor I komme ind i et Hus, siger der først: Fred være med
      dette Hus!
  6.  Og er der sammesteds et Fredens Barn, skal eders Fred Hvile på
      ham; men hvis ikke, da skal den vende tilbage til eder igen.
  7.  Men bliver i det samme Hus, spiser og drikker, hvad de have; thi
      Arbejderen er sin Løn værd. I må ikke flytte fra Hus til Hus
  8.  Og hvor I komme ind i en By. og de modtage eder, spiser der,
      hvad der sættes for eder;
  9.  og Helbreder de syge, som ere der, og siger dem: Guds Rige er
      kommet nær til eder.
 10.  Men hvor I komme ind i en By og de ikke modtage eder, der skulle
      I gå ud på dens Gader og sige:
 11.  Endog det Støv, som hænger ved vore Fødder fra eders By, tørre
      vi af til eder; dog dette skulle I vide, at Guds Rige er kommet
      nær.
 12.  Men jeg siger eder, det skal gå Sodoma tåleligere på hin Dag end
      den By.
 13.  Ve dig, Korazin! ve dig, Bethsajda! thi dersom de kraftige
      Gerninger, som ere skete i eder, vare skete i Tyrus og Sidon, da
      havde de for længe siden omvendt sig, siddende i Sæk og Aske.
 14.  Men det skal gå Tyrus og Sidon tåleligere ved Dommen end eder.
 15.  Og du, Kapernaum, som er bleven ophøjet indtil Himmelen, du skal
      nedstødes indtil Dødsriget.
 16.  Den, som hører eder, hører mig, og den, som foragter eder,
      foragter mig; men den, som foragter mig, foragter den, som
      udsendte mig."

 17.  Men de halvfjerdsindsfyve vendte tilbage med Glæde og sagde:
      "Herre! også de onde Ånder ere os lydige i dit Navn."
 18.  Men han sagde til dem: "Jeg så Satan falde ned fra Himmelen som
      et Lyn.
 19.  Se, jeg har givet eder Myndighed til at træde på Slanger og
      Skorpioner og over hele Fjendens Magt, og slet intet skal skade
      eder.
 20.  Dog, glæder eder ikke derover, at Ånderne ere eder lydige; men
      glæder eder over, at eders Navne ere indskrevne i Himlene."

 21.  I den samme Stund frydede Jesus sig i den Helligånd og sagde:
      "Jeg priser dig, Fader, Himmelens og Jordens Herre! fordi du har
      skjult dette for vise og forstandige og åbenbaret det for
      umyndige. Ja, Fader! thi således skete det, som var
      velbehageligt for dig.
 22.  Alle Ting ere mig overgivne af min Fader; og ingen kender, hvem
      Sønnen er, uden Faderen, og hvem Faderen er, uden Sønnen og den,
      for hvem Sønnen vil åbenbare ham."
 23.  Og han vendte sig til Disciplene og sagde særligt til dem:
      "Salige ere de Øjne, som se det, I se.
 24.  Thi jeg siger eder, at mange Profeter og Konger have ville se
      det, I se, og have ikke set det, og høre det, I høre, og have
      ikke hørt det."

 25.  Og se, en lovkyndig stod op og fristede ham og sagde: "Mester!
      hvad skal jeg gøre, for at jeg kan arve et evigt Liv?"
 26.  Men han sagde til ham: "Hvad er der skrevet i Loven, hvorledes
      læser du?".
 27.  Men han svarede og sagde til ham: "Du skal elske Herren din Gud
      af hele dit Hjerte og med hele din Sjæl og med hele din Styrke
      og med hele dit Sind, og din Næste som dig selv."
 28.  Men han sagde til ham: "Du svarede ret; gør dette, så skal du
      leve."
 29.  Men han vilde gøre sig selv retfærdig og sagde til Jesus: "Hvem
      er da min Næste?"
 30.  Men Jesus svarede og sagde: "Et Menneske gik ned fra Jerusalem
      til Jeriko, og han faldt iblandt Røvere, som både klædte ham af
      og sloge ham og gik bort og lod ham ligge halvdød.
 31.  Men ved en Hændelse gik en Præst den samme Vej ned, og da han så
      ham, gik han forbi.
 32.  Ligeså også en Levit; da han kom til Stedet, gik han hen og så
      ham og gik forbi.
 33.  Men en Samaritan, som var på Rejse, kom til ham, og da han så
      ham, ynkedes han inderligt.
 34.  Og han gik hen til ham, forbandt hans Sår og gød Olie og Vin
      deri, løftede ham op på sit eget Dyr og førte ham til et
      Herberge og plejede ham.
 35.  Og den næste Dag tog han to Denarer frem og gav Værten dem og
      sagde: Plej ham! og hvad mere du lægger ud, vil jeg betale dig,
      når jeg kommer igen.
 36.  Hvilken af disse tre tykkes dig nu at have været hans Næste, der
      var falden iblandt Røverne?"
 37.  Men han sagde: "Han, som øvede.Barmhjertighed imod ham." Og
      Jesus sagde til ham: "Gå bort, og gør du ligeså!"

 38.  Men det skete, medens de vare på Vandring, gik han ind i en
      Landsby; og en Kvinde ved Navn Martha modtog ham i sit Hus.
 39.  Og hun havde en Søster, som hed Maria, og hun satte sig ved
      Herrens Fødder og hørte på hans Tale.
 40.  Men Martha havde travlt med megen Opvartning; og hun kom hen og
      sagde: "Herre! bryder du dig ikke om, at min Søster har ladet
      mig opvarte ene? Sig hende dog, at hun skal hjælpe mig."
 41.  Men Herren svarede og sagde til hende: "Martha! Martha! du gør
      dig Bekymring og Uro med mange Ting;
 42.  men eet er fornødent. Maria har valgt den gode Del, som ikke
      skal tages fra hende."

Lukas 11

  1.  Og det skete, da han var på et Sted og bad, at en af hans
      Disciple sagde til ham, da han holdt op: "Herre! lær os at bede,
      som også Johannes lærte sine Disciple."
  2.  Da sagde han til dem: "Når I bede, da siger: Fader, Helliget
      vorde dit Navn; komme dit Rige;
  3.  giv os hver dag vort daglige Brød;
  4.  og forlad os vore Synder, thi også vi forlade hver, som er os
      skyldig; og led os ikke i Fristelse!"
  5.  Og han sagde til dem: "Om nogen af eder har en Ven og går til
      ham ved Midnat og siger til ham: Kære! lån mig tre Brød,
  6.  efterdi en Ven af mig er kommen til mig fra Rejsen, og jeg har
      intet at sætte for ham;
  7.  og hin så svarer derinde fra og siger: Vold mig ikke Besvær;
      Døren er allerede lukket, og mine Børn ere med mig i Seng; jeg
      kan ikke stå op og give dig det:
  8.  da, siger jeg eder, om han end ikke står op og giver ham det,
      fordi han er hans Ven, så står han dog op for hans Påtrængenheds
      Skyld og giver ham alt, hvad han trænger til.
  9.  Og jeg siger eder: Beder, så skal eder gives; søger, så skulle I
      finde; banker på, så skal der lukkes op for eder.
 10.  Thi hver den, som beder, han får, og den, som søger, han finder,
      og den, som banker på, for ham skal der lukkes op.
 11.  Men hvilken Fader iblandt eder vil give sin Søn en Sten, når han
      beder om Brød, eller når han beder om en Fisk, mon han da i
      Stedet for en Fisk vil give ham en Slange?
 12.  Eller når han beder om et Æg, mon han da vil give ham en
      Skorpion?
 13.  Dersom da I, som ere onde, vide at give eders Børn gode Gaver,
      hvor meget mere skal da Faderen fra Himmelen give den Helligånd
      til dem, som bede ham!"

 14.  Og han uddrev en ond Ånd, og den var stum; men det skete, da den
      onde Ånd var udfaren, talte den stumme, og Skaren forundrede
      sig.
 15.  Men nogle af dem sagde: "Ved Beelzebul, de onde Ånders Fyrste,
      uddriver han de onde Ånder."
 16.  Men andre fristede ham og forlangte af ham et Tegn fra
      Himmelen..
 17.  Men da han kendte deres Tanker, sagde han til dem: "Hvert Rige,
      som er kommet i Splid med sig selv, lægges øde, og Hus falder
      over Hus.
 18.  Men hvis også Satan er kommen i Splid med sig selv, hvorledes
      skal hans Rige da bestå? Thi l sige, at jeg uddriver de onde
      Ånder ved Beelzebul.
 19.  Men dersom jeg uddriver de onde Ånder ved Beelzebul, ved hvem
      uddrive da eders Sønner dem? Derfor skulle de være eders
      Dommere.
 20.  Men dersom jeg uddriver de onde Ånder ved Guds Finger, da er jo
      Guds Rige kommet til eder.
 21.  Når den stærke bevæbnet vogter sin Gård, bliver det, han ejer, i
      Fred.
 22.  Men når en stærkere end han er kommen over ham og har overvundet
      ham, da tager han hans fulde Rustning, som han forlod sig på, og
      uddeler hans Bytte.
 23.  Den, som ikke er med mig, er imod mig; og den, som ikke samler
      med mig, adspreder.
 24.  Når den urene Ånd er faren ud af Mennesket, vandrer den igennem
      vandløse Steder og søger Hvile; og når den ikke finder den,
      siger den: Jeg vil vende tilbage til mit Hus, som jeg gik ud af.
 25.  Og når den kommer, finder den det fejet og prydet.
 26.  Da går den bort og tager syv andre Ånder med sig, som ere værre
      end den selv, og når de ere komne derind, bo de der; og det
      sidste bliver værre med dette Menneske end det første."

 27.  Men det skete, medens han sagde disse Ting, da opløftede en
      Kvinde af Skaren sin Røst og sagde til ham: "Saligt er det Liv,
      som bar dig, og de Bryster, som du diede."
 28.  Men han sagde: "Ja, salige ere de, som høre Guds Ord og bevare
      det."

 29.  Men da Skarerne strømmede til, begyndte han at sige: "Denne
      Slægt er en ond Slægt; et Tegn forlanger den, og der skal intet
      Tegn gives den uden Jonas's Tegn.
 30.  Thi ligesom Jonas blev et Tegn for Niniviterne, således skal
      også Menneskesønnen være det for denne Slægt.
 31.  Sydens Dronning skal oprejses ved Dommen sammen med Mændene af
      denne Slægt og fordømme dem; thi hun kom fra Jordens Grænser for
      at høre Salomons Visdom; og se, her er mere end Salomon.
 32.  Mænd fra Ninive skulle opstå ved Dommen sammen med denne Slægt
      og fordømme den; thi de omvendte sig ved Jonas's Prædiken; og
      se, her er mere end Jonas.

 33.  Ingen tænder et Lys og sætter det i Skjul, ikke heller under
      Skæppen, men på Lysestagen, for at de, som komme ind, kunne se
      dets Skin.
 34.  Dit Øje er Legemets Lys; når dit Øje er sundt, er også hele dit
      Legeme lyst, men dersom det er dårligt, er også dit Legeme
      mørkt.
 35.  Se derfor til, at det Lys, der er i dig, ikke er Mørke.
 36.  Dersom da hele dit Legeme et lyst, så at ingen Del deraf er
      mørk, vil det være helt lyst, som når Lyset bestråler dig med
      sin Glans."

 37.  Men idet han talte, beder en Farisæer ham om, at han vilde spise
      Middagsmåltid hos ham, og han gik ind og satte sig til Bords.
 38.  Men Farisæeren forundrede sig, da han så, at han ikke toede sig
      først før Måltidet.
 39.  Men Herren sagde til ham: "I Farisæere rense nu det udvendige af
      Bægeret og Fadet; men eders Indre er fuldt af Rov og Ondskab.
 40.  I Dårer! han, som gjorde det ydre, gjorde han ikke også det
      indre?
 41.  Men giver det, som er indeni, til Almisse; se, så ere alle Ting
      eder rene.
 42.  Men ve eder, I Farisæere! thi I give Tiende af Mynte og Rude og
      alle Hånde Urter og forbigå Retten og Kærligheden til Gud; disse
      Ting burde man gøre og ikke forsømme hine.
 43.  Ve eder, I Farisæere! thi I elske den fornemste Plads i
      Synagogerne og Hilsenerne på Torvene.
 44.  Ve eder, thi I ere som de ukendelige Grave, og Menneskene, som
      gå over dem, vide det ikke."
 45.  Men en af de lovkyndige svarede og siger til ham: "Mester! idet
      du siger dette, forhåner du også os,"
 46.  Men han sagde: "Ve også eder, I lovkyndige! thi I lægge
      Menneskene Byrder på, vanskelige at bære, og selv røre I ikke
      Byrderne med een af eders Fingre.
 47.  Ve eder! thi I bygge Profeternes Grave, og eders Fædre sloge dem
      ihjel.
 48.  Altså ere I Vidner og samtykke i eders Fædres Gerninger; thi de
      sloge dem ihjel, og I bygge.
 49.  Derfor har også Guds Visdom sagt: Jeg vil sende Profeter og
      Apostle til dem, og nogle af dem skulle de slå ihjel og
      forfølge,
 50.  for at alle Profeternes Blod, som er udøst fra Verdens
      Grundlæggelse, skal kræves af denne Slægt,
 51.  fra Abels Blod indtil Sakarias's Blod, som blev dræbt imellem
      Alteret og Templet; ja, jeg siger eder: Det skal kræves af denne
      Slægt.
 52.  Ve eder, I lovkyndige! thi I have taget Kundskabens Nøgle; selv
      ere I ikke gåede ind, og dem, som vilde gå ind, have I
      forhindret."
 53.  Og da han var gået ud derfra, begyndte de skriftkloge og
      Farisæerne at trænge stærkt ind på ham og at lokke Ord af hans
      Mund om flere Ting;
 54.  thi de lurede på ham for at opfange noget af hans Mund, for at
      de kunde anklage ham.

Lukas 12

  1.  Da imidlertid mange Tusinde Mennesker havde samlet sig, så at de
      trådte på hverandre, begyndte han at sige til sine Disciple:
      "Tager eder først og fremmest i Vare for Farisæernes Surdejg,
      som er Hykleri.
  2.  Men intet er skjult, som jo skal åbenbares, og intet er lønligt,
      som jo skal blive kendt.
  3.  Derfor, alt hvad I have sagt i Mørket, skal høres i Lyset; og
      hvad I have talt i Øret i Kamrene, skal blive prædiket på
      Tagene.

  4.  Men jeg siger til eder, mine Venner! frygter ikke for dem, som
      slå Legemet ihjel og derefter ikke formå at gøre mere.
  5.  Men jeg vil vise eder, for hvem I skulle frygte: Frygter for
      ham, som har Magt til, efter at have slået ihjel, at kaste i
      Helvede; ja, jeg siger eder: Frygter for ham!
  6.  Sælges ikke fem Spurve for to Penninge? og ikke een af dem er
      glemt hos Gud.
  7.  Ja, endog Hårene på eders Hoved ere alle talte; frygter ikke, I
      ere mere værd end mange Spurve.
  8.  Men jeg siger eder: Enhver, som vedkender sig mig for
      Menneskene, ham vil også Menneskesønnen vedkende sig for Guds
      Engle.
  9.  Og den, som har fornægtet mig for Menneskene, skal fornægtes for
      Guds Engle.
 10.  Og enhver, som taler et Ord imod Menneskesønnen, ham skal det
      forlades; men den, som har talt bespotteligt imod den Helligånd,
      ham skal det ikke forlades.
 11.  Men når de føre eder frem for Synagogerne og Øvrighederne og
      Myndighederne, da bekymrer eder ikke for, hvorledes eller
      hvormed I skulle forsvare eder, eller hvad I skulle sige.
 12.  Thi den Helligånd skal lære eder i den samme Time, hvad I bør
      sige."

 13.  Men en af Skaren sagde til ham: "Mester! sig til min Broder, at
      han skal dele Arven med mig."
 14.  Men han sagde til ham: "Menneske! hvem har sat mig til Dommer
      eller Deler over eder?"
 15.  Og han sagde til dem: "Ser til og vogter eder for al Havesyge;
      thi ingens Liv beror på, hvad han ejer, selv om han har
      Overflod."
 16.  Og han sagde en Lignelse til dem: "Der var en rig Mand, hvis
      Mark havde båret godt.
 17.  Og han tænkte ved sig selv og sagde: Hvad skal jeg gøre? thi jeg
      har ikke Rum, hvori jeg kan samle min Afgrøde.
 18.  Og han sagde: Dette vil jeg gøre, jeg vil nedbryde mine Lader og
      bygge dem større, og jeg vil samle deri al min Afgrøde og mit
      Gods;
 19.  og jeg vil sige til min Sjæl: Sjæl! du har mange gode Ting
      liggende for mange År; slå dig til Ro, spis, drik, vær lystig!
 20.  Men Gud sagde til ham: Du Dåre! i denne Nat kræves din Sjæl af
      dig; men hvem skal det høre til. som du har beredt?
 21.  Således er det med den, som samler sig Skatte og ikke er rig i
      Gud."

 22.  Men han sagde til sine Disciple: "Derfor siger jeg eder:
      Bekymrer eder ikke for Livet, hvad I skulle spise; ikke heller
      for Legemet, hvad I skulle iføre eder.
 23.  Livet er mere end Maden, og Legemet mere end Klæderne.
 24.  Giver Agt på Ravnene, at de hverken så eller høste og de have
      ikke Forrådskammer eller Lade, og Gud føder dem; hvor langt mere
      værd end Fuglene ere dog I?
 25.  Og hvem af eder kan ved at bekymre sig lægge en Alen til sin
      Vækst?
 26.  Formå I altså ikke engang det mindste, hvorfor bekymre I eder da
      for det øvrige?
 27.  Giver Agt på Lillierne, hvorledes de vokse; de arbejde ikke og
      spinde ikke; men jeg siger eder: End ikke Salomon i al sin
      Herlighed var klædt som en af dem.
 28.  Klæder da Gud således det Græs på Marken, som i Dag står og i
      Morgen kastes i Ovnen, hvor meget mere eder, I lidettroende!
 29.  Og I, spørger ikke efter, hvad I skulle spise, og hvad I skulle
      drikke; og værer ikke ængstelige!
 30.  Thi efter alt dette søge Hedningerne i Verden; men eders Fader
      ved, at I have disse Ting nødig.
 31.  Men søger hans Rige, så skulle disse Ting gives eder i Tilgift.
 32.  Frygt ikke, du lille Hjord! thi det var eders Fader
      velbehageligt at give eder Riget.
 33.  Sælger, hvad I eje, og giver Almisse! Gører eder Punge, som ikke
      ældes, en Skat i Himlene, som ikke slipper op, der hvor ingen
      Tyv kommer nær, og intet Møl ødelægger.
 34.  Thi hvor eders Skat er, der vil også eders Hjerte være.

 35.  Eders Lænder være omgjordede, og eders Lys brændende!
 36.  Og værer I ligesom Mennesker, der vente på deres Herre, når han
      vil bryde op fra Brylluppet, for at de straks, når han kommer og
      banker på, kunne lukke op for ham.
 37.  Salige ere de Tjenere, som Herren finder vågne, når han kommer.
      Sandelig, siger jeg eder, at han skal binde op om sig og sætte
      dem til Bords og gå om og varte dem op,
 38.  Og dersom han kommer i den anden Nattevagt og kommer i den
      tredje Nattevagt og finder det således, da ere disse Tjenere
      salige.
 39.  Men dette skulle I vide, at dersom Husbonden vidste, i hvilken
      Time Tyven vilde komme, da vågede han og tillod ikke, at der
      skete Indbrud i hans Hus.
 40.  Vorder også I rede; thi Menneskesønnen kommer i den Time, som I
      ikke mene."
 41.  Men Peter sagde til ham: "Herre! siger du denne Lignelse til os
      eller også til alle?"
 42.  Og Herren sagde: "Hvem er vel den tro og forstandige Husholder,
      som Herren vil sætte over sit Tyende til at give dem den
      bestemte Kost i rette Tid?
 43.  Salig er den Tjener, hvem hans Herre, når han kommer, finder
      handlende således.
 44.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, han skal sætte ham over alt, hvad han
      ejer.
 45.  Men dersom hin Tjener siger i sit Hjerte: "Min Herre tøver med
      at komme" og så begynder at slå Karlene og Pigerne og at spise
      og drikke og beruse sig,
 46.  da skal den Tjeners Herre komme på den Dag, han ikke venter, og
      i den Time, han ikke ved, og hugge ham sønder og give ham hans
      Lod sammen med de utro:
 47.  Men den Tjener, som har kendt sin Herres Villie og ikke har
      truffet Forberedelser eller handlet efter hans Villie, skal have
      mange Hug;
 48.  men den, som ikke har kendt den og har gjort, hvad der er Hug
      værd, skal have få Hug. Enhver, hvem meget er givet, af ham skal
      man kræve meget; og hvem meget er betroet, af ham skal man
      forlange mere.

 49.  Ild er jeg kommen at kaste på Jorden, og hvor vilde jeg, at den
      var optændt allerede!
 50.  Men en Dåb har jeg at døbes med, og hvor ængstes jeg, indtil den
      er fuldbyrdet!
 51.  Mene I, at jeg er kommen for at give Fred på Jorden? Nej, siger
      jeg eder, men Splid,
 52.  Thi fra nu af skulle fem i eet Hus være i Splid indbyrdes, tre
      imod to, og to imod tre.
 53.  De skulle være i Splid, Fader med Søn og Søn med Fader, Moder
      med Datter og Datter med Moder, Svigermoder med sin Svigerdatter
      og Svigerdatter med sin Svigermoder."

 54.  Men han sagde også til Skarerne: "Når I se en Sky komme op i
      Vester, sige I straks: Der kommer Regn, og det sker således.
 55.  Og når I se en Søndenvind blæse, sige I: Der kommer Hede: og det
      sker.
 56.  I Hyklere! Jordens og Himmelens Udseende vide I at skønne om;
      men hvorfor have I da intet Skøn om den nærværende Tid?
 57.  Og hvorfor dømme I ikke også fra eder selv, hvad der er det
      rette?
 58.  Thi medens du går hen med din Modpart til Øvrigheden, da gør dig
      Flid på Vejen for at blive forligt med ham, for at han ikke skal
      trække dig for Dommeren, og Dommeren skal overgive dig til
      Slutteren, og Slutteren skal kaste dig i Fængsel.
 59.  Jeg siger dig: Du skal ingenlunde komme ud derfra, førend du får
      betalt endog den sidste Skærv."

Lukas 13

  1.  Men på den samme Tid var der nogle til Stede, som fortalte ham
      om de Galilæere, hvis Blod Pilatus havde blandet med deres Ofre.
  2.  Og han svarede og sagde til dem: "Mene I, at disse Galilæere
      vare Syndere frem for alle Galilæere, fordi de have lidt dette?
  3.  Nej, siger jeg eder; men dersom I ikke omvende eder, skulle I
      alle omkomme ligeså.
  4.  Eller hine atten, som Tårnet i Siloam faldt ned over og
      ihjelslog, mene I, at de vare skyldige fremfor alle Mennesker,
      som bo i Jerusalem?
  5.  Nej, siger jeg eder; men dersom I ikke omvende eder, skulle I
      alle omkomme ligeså."

  6.  Men han sagde denne Lignelse: "En havde et Figentræ, som var
      plantet i hans Vingård; og han kom og ledte efter Frugt derpå og
      fandt ingen.
  7.  Men han sagde til Vingårdsmanden: Se, i tre År er jeg nu kommen
      og har ledt efter Frugt på dette Figentræ og ingen fundet; hug
      det om; hvorfor skal det tilmed gøre Jorden unyttig?
  8.  Men han svarede og sagde til ham: Herre! lad det stå endnu dette
      År, indtil jeg får gravet om det og gødet det;
  9.  måske vil det bære Frugt i Fremtiden; men hvis ikke, da hug det
      om!"

 10.  Men han lærte i en af Synagogerne på Sabbaten.
 11.  Og se, der var en Kvinde, som havde haft en Svagheds Ånd i atten
      År, og hun var sammenbøjet og kunde aldeles ikke rette sig op.
 12.  Men da Jesus så hende, kaldte han på hende og sagde til hende:
      "Kvinde! du er løst fra din Svaghed."
 13.  Og han lagde Hænderne på hende; og straks rettede hun sig op og
      priste Gud.
 14.  Men Synagogeforstanderen, som var vred, fordi Jesus helbredte på
      Sabbaten, tog til Orde og sagde til Folkeskaren: "Der er seks
      Dage, på hvilke man bør arbejde; kommer derfor på dem og lader
      eder helbrede, og ikke på Sabbatsdagen!"
 15.  Men Herren svarede ham og sagde: "I Hyklere! løser ikke enhver
      iblandt eder sin Okse eller sit Asen fra Krybben på Sabbaten og
      fører dem til Vands?
 16.  Men denne, som er en Abrahams Datter, hvem Satan har bundet, se,
      i atten År, burde hun ikke løses fra dette Bånd på
      Sabbatsdagen?"
 17.  Og da han sagde dette, bleve alle hans Modstandere beskæmmede;
      og hele Skaren glædede sig over alle de herlige Gerninger, som
      gjordes af ham.

 18.  Han sagde da: "Hvad ligner Guds Rige, og hvormed skal jeg ligne
      det?
 19.  Det ligner et Sennepskorn, som et Menneske tog og lagde i sin
      Have; og det voksede og blev til et Træ, og Himmelens Fugle
      byggede Rede i dets Grene."
 20.  Og atter sagde han: "Hvormed skal jeg ligne Guds Rige?
 21.  Det ligner en Surdejg, som en Kvinde tog og lagde ned i tre Mål
      Mel, indtil det blev syret alt sammen."

 22.  Og han gik igennem Byer og Landsbyer og lærte og tog Vejen til
      Jerusalem.
 23.  Men en sagde til ham: "Herre mon de ere få, som blive frelste?"
      Da sagde han til dem:
 24.  "Kæmper for at komme ind igennem den snævre Port; thi mange,
      siger jeg eder, skulle søge at komme ind og ikke formå det.
 25.  Fra den Stund Husbonden er stået op og har lukket Døren, og I
      begynde at stå udenfor og banke på Døren og sige: Herre, luk op
      for os! da vil han svare og sige til eder: Jeg kender eder ikke,
      hvorfra I ere;
 26.  da skulle I begynde at sige: vi spiste og drak for dine Øjne, og
      du lærte på vore Gader,
 27.  og han skal sige: Jeg siger eder, jeg kender eder ikke, hvorfra
      I ere; viger bort fra mig, alle I, som øve Uret!
 28.  Der skal der være Gråd og Tænders Gnidsel, når I må se Abraham
      og Isak og Jakob og alle Profeterne i Guds Rige, men eder selv
      blive kastede udenfor.
 29.  Og de skulle komme fra Øster og Vester og fra Norden og Sønden
      og sidde til Bords i Guds Rige.
 30.  Og se, der er sidste, som skulle være iblandt de første, og der
      er første, som skulle være iblandt de sidste."

 31.  I den samme Stund kom nogle Farisæere og sagde til ham: "Gå
      bort, og drag herfra; thi Herodes vil slå dig ihjel."
 32.  Og han sagde til dem: "Går hen og siger til denne Ræv: Se, jeg
      uddriver onde Ånder og fuldfører Helbredelser i Dag og i Morgen,
      og på den tredje dag fuldendes jeg.
 33.  Dog bør jeg vandre i Dag og i Morgen og den Dag derefter; thi
      det sømmer sig ikke, at en Profet dræbes uden for Jerusalem.
 34.  Jerusalem! Jerusalem! som ihjelslår Profeterne og stener dem,
      som ere sendte til dig! hvor ofte vilde jeg samle dine Børn,
      ligesom en Høne samler sine Kyllinger under Vingerne! Og I vilde
      ikke.
 35.  Se, eders Hus overlades til eder selv. Men jeg siger eder: I
      skulle ingenlunde se mig, førend den Tid kommer, da I sige:
      Velsigtnet være den, som kommer, i Herrens Navn!"

Lukas 14

  1.  Og det skete, da han kom ind i en af de øverste Farisæeres Hus
      på en Sabbat for at holde Måltid, at de toge Vare på ham.
  2.  Og se, der stod en vattersottig Mand foran ham.
  3.  Og Jesus tog til Orde og sagde til de lovkyndige og Farisæerne:
      "Er det tilladt at helbrede på Sabbaten eller ej?"
  4.  Men de tav. Og han tog på ham og helbredte ham og lod ham fare.
  5.  Og han tog til Orde og sagde til dem: "Hvem er der iblandt eder,
      som ikke straks, når hans Søn eller Okse falder i en Brønd,
      drager dem op på Sabbatsdagen?"
  6.  Og de kunde ikke give Svar derpå.

  7.  Men han sagde en Lignelse til de budne, da han gav Agt på,
      hvorledes de udvalgte sig de øverste Pladser ved Bordet, og
      sagde til dem:
  8.  "Når du bliver buden af nogen til Bryllup, da sæt dig ikke
      øverst til Bords, for at ikke en fornemmere end du måtte være
      buden af ham,
  9.  og han, som indbød dig og ham, måtte komme og sige til dig: Giv
      denne Plads, og du da med Skam komme til at sidde nederst.
 10.  Men når du bliver buden, da gå hen og sæt dig nederst, for at,
      når han kommer, som har indbudt dig, han da må sige til dig:
      Ven!  sæt dig højere op; da skal du have Ære for alle dem, som
      sidde til Bords med dig.
 11.  Thi enhver, som Ophøjer sig selv, skal fornedres; og den, som
      fornedrer sig selv, skal ophøjes."
 12.  Men han sagde også til ham, som havde indbudt ham: "Når du gør
      Middags- eller Aftensmåltid, da byd ikke dine Venner, ej heller
      dine Brødre, ej heller dine Frænder, ej heller rige Naboer, for
      at ikke også de skulle indbyde dig igen, og du få Vederlag.
 13.  Men når du gør et Gæstebud, da indbyd fattige, vanføre, lamme,
      blinde!
 14.  Så skal du være salig; thi de have intet at gengælde dig med;
      men det skal gengældes dig i de retfærdiges Opstandelse."

 15.  Men da en af dem, som sade med til Bords, hørte dette, sagde han
      til ham: "Salig er den, som holder Måltid i Guds Rige."
 16.  Men han sagde til ham: "der var en Mand, som gjorde en stor
      Nadver og indbød mange.
 17.  Og han udsendte sin Tjener på Nadverens Time for at sige til de
      budne: Kommer! thi nu er det beredt.
 18.  Og de begyndte alle som een at undskylde sig. Den første sagde
      til ham: Jeg har købt en Mark og har nødig at gå ud og se den;
      jeg beder dig, hav mig undskyldt!
 19.  Og en anden sagde: Jeg har købt fem Par Okser og går hen at
      prøve dem; jeg beder dig, hav mig undskyldt!
 20.  Og en anden sagde: Jeg har taget mig en Hustru til Ægte, og
      derfor kan jeg ikke komme.
 21.  Og Tjeneren kom og meldte sin Herre dette; da blev Husbonden
      vred og sagde til sin Tjener: Gå hurtig ud på Byens Stræder og
      Gader, og før de fattige og vanføre og lamme og blinde herind!
 22.  Og Tjeneren sagde: Herre! det er sket, som du befalede, og der
      er endnu Rum.
 23.  Og Herre sagde til Tjeneren: Gå ud på Vejene og ved Gærderne og
      nød dem til at gå ind, for at mit Hus kan blive fuldt.
 24.  Thi jeg siger eder, at ingen af hine Mænd, som vare budne, skal
      smage min Nadver."

 25.  Men store Skarer gik med ham, og han vendte sig og sagde til
      dem:
 26.  "Dersom nogen kommer til mig og ikke hader sin Fader og Moder og
      Hustru og Børn og Brødre og Søstre, ja endog sit eget Liv, kan
      han ikke være min Discipel.
 27.  Den, som ikke bærer sit Kors og følger efter mig, kan ikke være
      min Discipel.
 28.  Thi hvem iblandt eder, som vil bygge et Tårn, sætter sig ikke
      først hen og beregner Omkostningen, om han har nok til at
      fuldføre det,
 29.  for at ikke, når han får lagt Grunden og ej kan fuldende det,
      alle, som se det, skulle begynde at spotte ham og sige:
 30.  Dette Menneske begyndte at bygge og kunde ikke fuldende det.
 31.  Eller hvilken Konge, som drager ud for at gå i Kamp imod en
      anden Konge, sætter sig ikke først hen og rådslår, om han er
      mægtig til med ti Tusinde at møde den, som kommer imod ham med
      tyve Tusinde?
 32.  Men hvis ikke, sender han, medens den anden endnu er langt
      borte, Sendebud hen og underhandler om Fred.
 33.  Således kan da ingen af eder, som ikke forsager alt det, han
      ejer, være min Discipel.
 34.  Saltet er altså godt; men dersom også Saltet mister sin Kraft,
      hvorved skal det da få den igen?
 35.  Det er ikke tjenligt hverken til Jord eller til Gødning; man
      kaster det ud. Den, som har Øren at høre med, han høre!"

Lukas 15

  1.  Men alle Toldere og Syndere holdt sig nær til ham for at høre
      ham.
  2.  Og både Farisæerne og de skriftkloge knurrede og sagde: "Denne
      tager imod Syndere og spiser med dem."
  3.  Men han talte denne Lignelse til dem og sagde:
  4.  "Hvilket Menneske af eder, som har hundrede Får og har mistet
      eet af dem, forlader ikke de ni og halvfemsindstyve i Ørkenen og
      går ud efter det, han har mistet, indtil han finder det?
  5.  Og når han har fundet det, lægger han det på sine Skuldre med
      Glæde.
  6.  Og når han kommer hjem, sammenkalder han sine Venner og Naboer
      og siger til dem: Glæder eder med mig; thi jeg har fundet mit
      Får, som jeg havde mistet.
  7.  Jeg siger eder: Således skal der være Glæde i Himmelen over een
      Synder, som omvender sig, mere end over ni og halvfemsindstyve
      retfærdige, som ikke trænge til Omvendelse.

  8.  Eller hvilken Kvinde, som har ti Drakmer og taber een Drakme,
      tænder ikke Lys og fejer Huset og søger med Flid, indtil hun
      finder den?
  9.  Og når hun har fundet den, sammenkalder hun sine Veninder og
      Naboersker og siger: Glæder eder med mig; thi jeg har fundet den
      Drakme, som jeg havde tabt.
 10.  Således, siger jeg eder, bliver der Glæde hos Guds Engle over
      een Synder, som omvender sig."

 11.  Men han sagde: "En Mand havde to Sønner.
 12.  Og den yngste af dem sagde til Faderen: Fader! giv mig den Del
      af Formuen, som tilfalder mig. Og han skiftede Godset imellem
      dem.
 13.  Og ikke mange Dage derefter samlede den yngste Søn alt sit og
      drog udenlands til et fjernt Land og ødte der sin Formue i et
      ryggesløst Levned.
 14.  Men da han havde sat alt til, blev der en svær Hungersnød i det
      samme Land; og han begyndte at lide Mangel.
 15.  Og han gik hen og holdt sig til en af Borgerne der i Landet, og
      denne sendte ham ud på sine Marker for at vogte Svin.
 16.  Og han attråede at fylde sin Bug med de Bønner, som Svinene åde;
      og ingen gav ham noget.
 17.  Men han gik i sig selv og sagde: Hvor mange Daglejere hos min
      Fader have ikke Brød i Overflødighed? men jeg omkommer her af
      Hunger.
 18.  Jeg vil stå op og gå til min Fader og sige til ham: Fader! jeg
      har syndet imod Himmelen og over for dig,
 19.  jeg er ikke længer værd at kaldes din Søn, gør mig som en af
      dine Daglejere!
 20.  Og han stod op og kom til sin Fader. Men da han endnu var langt
      borte, så hans Fader ham og ynkedes inderligt, og han løb til og
      faldt ham om Halsen og kyssede ham.
 21.  Men Sønnen sagde til ham: Fader! jeg har syndet imod Himmelen og
      over for dig, jeg er ikke længer værd at kaldes din Søn.
 22.  Men Faderen sagde til sine Tjenere: Henter det bedste Klædebon
      frem, og ifører ham det, og giver ham en Ring på hans Hånd og
      Sko på Fødderne;
 23.  og henter Fedekalven og slagter den, og lader os spise og være
      lystige!
 24.  Thi denne min Søn var død og er bleven levende igen, han var
      fortabt og er funden. Og de begyndte at være lystige!
 25.  Men hans ældste Søn var på Marken, og da han kom og nærmede sig
      Huset, hørte han Musik og Dans.
 26.  Og han kaldte en af Karlene til sig og spurgte, hvad dette var?
 27.  Men han sagde til ham: Din Broder er kommen, og din Fader har
      slagtet Fedekalven, fordi han har fået ham sund igen.
 28.  Men han blev vred og vilde ikke gå ind. Men hans Fader gik ud og
      bad ham.
 29.  Men han svarede og sagde til Faderen: Se, så mange År har jeg
      tjent dig, og aldrig har jeg overtrådt noget af dine Bud, og du
      har aldrig givet mig et Kid, for at jeg kunde være lystig med
      mine Venner.
 30.  Men da denne din Søn kom, som har fortæret dit Gods med Skøger,
      slagtede du Fedekalven til ham.
 31.  Men han sagde til ham: Barn! du er altid hos mig, og alt mit er
      dit.
 32.  Men man burde være lystig og glæde sig, fordi denne din Broder
      var død og er bleven levende og var fortabt og er funden."

Lukas 16

  1.  Men han sagde også til Disciplene: "Der var en rig Mand, som
      havde en Husholder, og denne blev angiven for ham som en, der
      ødte hans Ejendom.
  2.  Og han lod ham kalde og sagde til ham: Hvad er dette, jeg hører
      om dig? Aflæg Regnskabet for din Husholdning; thi du kan ikke
      længer være Husholder.
  3.  Men Husholderen sagde ved sig selv: Hvad skal jeg gøre, efterdi
      min Herre tager Husholdningen fra mig? Jeg formår ikke at Grave,
      jeg skammer mig ved at tigge.
  4.  Nu ved jeg, hvad jeg vil gøre, for af de skulle modtage mig i
      deres Huse, når jeg bliver sat fra Husholdningen.
  5.  Og han kaldte hver enkelt af sin Herres Skyldnere til sig og
      sagde til den første: Hvor meget er du min Herre skyldig?
  6.  Men han sagde: Hundrede Fade Olie. Og han sagde til ham: Tag dit
      Skyldbrev, og sæt dig hurtig ned og skriv halvtredsindstyve!
  7.  Derefter sagde han til en anden: Men du, hvor meget er du
      skyldig?  Men han sagde: Hundrede Mål Hvede. Han siger til ham:
      Tag dit Skyldbrev og skriv firsindstyve!
  8.  Og Herren roste den uretfærdige Husholder, fordi han havde
      handlet klogelig; thi denne Verdens Børn ere klogere end Lysets
      Børn imod deres egen Slægt.
  9.  Og jeg siger eder: Gører eder Venner ved Uretfærdighedens
      Mammon, for at de, når det er forbi med den, må modtage eder i
      de evige Boliger.
 10.  Den, som er tro i det mindste, er også tro i meget, og den, som
      er uretfærdig i det mindste, er også uretfærdig i meget.
 11.  Dersom I da ikke have været tro i den uretfærdige Mammon, hvem
      vil da betro eder den sande?
 12.  Og dersom I ikke have været tro i det, som andre eje, hvem vil
      da give eder noget selv at eje?
 13.  Ingen Tjener kan tjene to Herrer; thi han vil enten hade den ene
      og elske den anden, eller holde sig til den ene og ringeagte den
      anden; I kunne ikke tjene Gud og Mammon."

 14.  Men alt dette hørte Farisæerne, som vare pengegerrige, og de
      spottede ham.
 15.  Og han sagde til dem: "I ere de, som gøre eder selv retfærdige
      for Menneskene; men Gud kender eders Hjerter; thi det, som er
      højt iblandt Mennesker, er en Vederstyggelighed for Gud.
 16.  Loven og Profeterne vare indtil Johannes; fra den Tid forkyndes
      Evangeliet om Guds Rige, og enhver trænger derind med Vold.
 17.  Men det er lettere, at Himmelen og Jorden forgå, end at en
      Tøddel af Loven bortfalder.
 18.  Hver, som skiller sig fra sin Hustru og tager en anden til Ægte,
      bedriver Hor; og hver, som tager til Ægte en Kvinde, der er
      skilt fra sin Mand, bedriver Hor.

 19.  Men der var en rig Mand, og han klædte sig i Purpur og kostbart
      Linned og levede hver Dag i Fryd og Herlighed.
 20.  Men en fattig ved Navn Lazarus var lagt ved hans Port, fuld af
      Sår.
 21.  Og han attråede at mættes af det, som faldt fra den Riges Bord;
      men også Hundene kom og slikkede hans Sår.
 22.  Men det skete, at den fattige døde, og at han blev henbåren af
      Englene i Abrahams Skød; men den rige døde også og blev
      begravet.
 23.  Og da han slog sine Øjne op i Dødsriget, hvor han var i Pine,
      ser han Abraham langt borte og Lazarus i hans Skød.
 24.  Og han råbte og sagde: Fader Abraham! forbarm dig over mig, og
      send Lazarus, for at han kan dyppe det yderste af sin Finger i
      Vand og læske min Tunge; thi jeg pines svarlig i denne Lue.
 25.  Men Abraham sagde: Barn! kom i Hu, at du har fået dit gode i din
      Livstid, og Lazarus ligeså det onde; men nu trøstes han her, og
      du pines.
 26.  Og foruden alt dette er der fæstet et stort Svælg imellem os og
      eder, for at de, som ville fare herfra over til eder, ikke
      skulle kunne det, og de ikke heller skulle fare derfra over til
      os.
 27.  Men han sagde: Så beder jeg dig, Fader! at du vil sende ham til
      min Faders Hus
 28.  thi jeg har fem Brødre for at han kan vidne for dem, for at ikke
      også de skulle komme i dette Pinested.
 29.  Men Abraham siger til ham: De have Moses og Profeterne, lad dem
      høre dem!
 30.  Men han sagde: Nej, Fader Abraham! men dersom nogen fra de døde
      kommer til dem, ville de omvende sig.
 31.  Men han sagde til ham: Høre de ikke Moses og Profeterne, da lade
      de sig heller ikke overbevise, om nogen opstår fra de døde."

Lukas 17

  1.  Men han sagde til sine Disciple: "Det er umuligt, at Forargelser
      ikke skulde komme; men ve den, ved hvem de komme!
  2.  Det er bedre for ham, om en Møllesten er lagt om hans Hals, og
      han er kastet i Havet end at han skulde forarge een af disse
      små.
  3.  Vogter på eder selv! Dersom din Broder synder, da irettesæt ham;
      og dersom han angrer, da tilgiv ham!
  4.  Og dersom han syv Gange om Dagen synder imod dig og syv Gange
      vender tilbage til dig og siger: Jeg angrer det, da skal du
      tilgive ham."

  5.  Og Apostlene sagde til Herren: "Giv os mere Tro!"
  6.  Men Herren sagde: "Dersom I havde Tro som et Sennepskorn, da
      kunde I sige til dette Morbærfigentræ: Ryk dig op med Rode, og
      plant dig i Havet, og det skulde adlyde eder.
  7.  Men hvem af eder, som har en Tjener, der pløjer eller vogter,
      siger til ham, når han kommer hjem fra Marken: Gå straks hen og
      sæt dig til Bords?
  8.  Vil han ikke tværtimod sige til ham: Tilbered, hvad jeg skal
      have til Nadver, og bind op om dig, og vart mig op, medens jeg
      spiser og drikker; og derefter må du spise og drikke?
  9.  Mon han takker Tjeneren, fordi han gjorde det, som var befalet?
      Jeg mener det ikke.
 10.  Således skulle også I, når I have gjort alle de Ting, som ere
      eder befalede, sige: Vi ere unyttige Tjenere; kun hvad vi vare
      skyldige at gøre, have vi gjort."

 11.  Og det skete, medens han var på Vej til Jerusalem, at han drog
      midt imellem Samaria og Galilæa.
 12.  Og da han gik ind i en Landsby, mødte der ham ti spedalske Mænd,
      som stode langt borte,
 13.  og de opløftede Røsten og sagde: "Jesus, Mester, forbarm dig
      over os!"
 14.  Og da han så dem, sagde han til dem: "Går hen og fremstiller
      eder for Præsterne!" Og det skete, medens de gik bort, bleve de
      rensede.
 15.  Men en af dem vendte tilbage, da han så, at han var helbredt, og
      priste Gud med høj Røst.
 16.  Og han faldt på sit Ansigt for hans Fødder og takkede ham; og
      denne var en Samaritan.
 17.  Men Jesus svarede og sagde: "Bleve ikke de ti rensede? hvor ere
      de ni?
 18.  Fandtes der ingen, som vendte tilbage for at give Gud Ære, uden
      denne fremmede?"
 19.  Og han sagde til ham:"Stå op, gå bort; din Tro har frelst dig!"

 20.  Men da han blev spurgt af Farisæerne om, når Guds Rige kommer,
      svarede han dem og sagde: "Guds Rige kommer ikke således, at man
      kan vise derpå.
 21.  Ikke heller vil man sige: Se her, eller: Se der er det; thi se,
      Guds Rige er inden i eder."

 22.  Men han sagde til Disciplene: "Der skal komme Dage, da I skulle
      attrå at se en af Menneskesønnens Dage, og I skulle ikke se den.
 23.  Og siger man til eder: Se der, eller: Se her er han, så går ikke
      derhen, og løber ikke derefter!
 24.  Thi ligesom Lynet, når det lyner fra den ene Side af Himmelen,
      skinner til den anden Side af Himmelen, således skal
      Menneskesønnen være på sin Dag.
 25.  Men først bør han lide meget og forkastes af denne Slægt.
 26.  Og som det skete i Noas Dage, således skal det også være i
      Menneskesønnens Dage:
 27.  De spiste, drak, toge til Ægte, bleve bortgiftede indtil den
      Dag, da Noa gik ind i Arken, og Syndfloden kom og ødelagde alle.
 28.  Ligeledes, som det skete i Loths Dage: De spiste, drak, købte,
      solgte, plantede, byggede;
 29.  men på den Dag, da Loth gik ud af Sodoma, regnede Ild og Svovl
      ned fra Himmelen og ødelagde dem alle:
 30.  på samme Måde skal det være på den Dag, da Menneskesønnen
      åbenbares.
 31.  På den dag skal den, som er på Taget og har sine Ejendele i
      Huset, ikke stige ned for at hente dem; og ligeså skal den, som
      er på Marken, ikke vende tilbage igen!
 32.  Kommer Loths Hustru i Hu!
 33.  Den, som søger at bjærge sit Liv, skal miste det; og den, som
      mister det, skal beholde Livet.
 34.  Jeg siger eder: I den Nat skulle to Mænd være på eet Leje; den
      ene skal tages med, og den anden skal lades tilbage.
 35.  To Kvinder skulle male på samme Kværn; den ene skal tages med,
      og den anden skal lades tilbage.
 36.  To Mænd skulle være på Marken; den ene skal tages med. og den
      anden skal lades tilbage."
 37.  Og de svare og sige til ham: "Hvor, Herre?" Men han sagde til
      dem: "Hvor Ådselet er, der ville også Ørnene samle sig."

Lukas 18

  1.  Men han talte til dem en Lignelse om, at de burde altid bede og
      ikke blive trætte,
  2.  og sagde: "Der var i en By en Dommer, som ikke frygtede Gud og
      ikke undså sig for noget Menneske.
  3.  Og der var en Enke i den By, og hun kom til ham og sagde: Skaf
      mig Ret over min Modpart!
  4.  Og længe vilde han ikke. Men derefter sagde han ved sig selv: Om
      jeg end ikke frygter Gud, ej heller undser mig for noget
      Menneske,
  5.  så vil jeg dog, efterdi denne Enke volder mig Besvær, skaffe
      Hende Ret, for at hun ikke uophørligt skal komme og plage mig."
  6.  Men Herren sagde: "Hører, hvad den uretfærdige Dommer siger!
  7.  Skulde da Gud ikke skaffe sine udvalgte Ret, de, som råbe til
      ham Dag og Nat? og er han ikke langmodig, når det gælder dem?
  8.  Jeg siger eder, han skal skaffe dem Ret i Hast. Men mon
      Menneskesønnen, når han kommer, vil finde Troen på Jorden?"

  9.  Men han sagde også til nogle, som stolede på sig selv, at de
      vare retfærdige, og foragtede de andre, denne Lignelse:
 10.  "Der gik to Mænd op til Helligdommen for at bede; den ene var en
      Farisæer, og den anden en Tolder.
 11.  Farisæeren stod og bad ved sig selv således: Gud! Jeg takker
      dig, fordi jeg ikke er som de andre Mennesker, Røvere,
      uretfærdige, Horkarle, eller også som denne Tolder.
 12.  Jeg faster to Gange om Ugen, jeg giver Tiende af al min indtægt.
 13.  Men Tolderen stod langt borte og vilde end ikke opløfte Øjnene
      til Himmelen, men slog sig for sit Bryst og sagde: Gud, vær mig
      Synder nådig!
 14.  Jeg siger eder: Denne gik retfærdiggjort hjem til sit Hus
      fremfor den anden; thi enhver, som Ophøjer sig selv, skal
      fornedres; men den, som fornedrer sig selv, skal ophøjes."

 15.  Men de bare også de små Børn til ham, for at han skulde røre ved
      dem; men da Disciplene så det, truede de dem.
 16.  Men Jesus kaldte dem til sig og sagde: "Lader de små Børn komme
      til mig, og formener dem det ikke; thi Guds Rige hører sådanne
      til.
 17.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, den, som ikke modtager Guds Rige
      ligesom et lille Barn, han skal ingenlunde komme ind i det."

 18.  Og en af de Øverste spurgte ham og sagde: "Gode Mester! hvad
      skal jeg gøre, for at jeg kan arve et evigt Liv?"
 19.  Men Jesus sagde til ham: "Hvorfor kalder du mig god? Ingen er
      god uden een, nemlig Gud.
 20.  Du kender Budene: Du må ikke bedrive Hor; du må ikke slå ihjel;
      du må ikke stjæle; du må ikke sige falsk Vidnesbyrd; Ær din
      Fader og din Moder."
 21.  Men han sagde: "Det har jeg holdt alt sammen fra min Ungdom af."
 22.  Men da Jesus hørte det, sagde han til ham: "Endnu een Ting
      fattes dig: Sælg alt, hvad du har, og uddel det til fattige, så
      skal du have en Skat i Himmelen; og kom så og følg mig!"
 23.  Men da han hørte dette, blev han dybt bedrøvet; thi han var såre
      rig.
 24.  Men da Jesus så, at han blev dybt bedrøvet, sagde han: "Hvor
      vanskeligt komme de, som have Rigdom, ind i Guds Rige!
 25.  thi det er lettere for en Kamel at gå igennem et Nåleøje end for
      en rig at gå ind i Guds Rige."
 26.  Men de, som hørte det, sagde: "Hvem kan da blive frelst?"
 27.  Men han sagde: "Hvad der er umuligt for Mennesker, det er muligt
      for Gud."
 28.  Men Peter sagde: "Se, vi have forladt vort eget og fulgt dig."
 29.  Men han sagde til dem: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, der er ingen,
      som har forladt Hus eller Forældre eller Brødre eller Hustru
      eller Børn for Guds Riges Skyld,
 30.  uden at han skal få det mange Fold igen i denne Tid og i den
      kommende Verden et evigt Liv."

 31.  Men han tog de tolv til sig og sagde til dem: "Se, vi drage op
      til Jerusalem, og alle de Ting, som ere skrevne ved Profeterne,
      skulle fuldbyrdes på Menneskesønnen.
 32.  Thi han skal overgives til Hedningerne og spottes, forhånes og
      bespyttes,
 33.  og de skulle hudstryge og ihjelslå ham; og på den tredje Dag
      skal han opstå."
 34.  Og de fattede intet deraf, og dette Ord var skjult for dem, og
      de forstode ikke det, som blev sagt.

 35.  Men det skete, da han nærmede sig til Jeriko, sad der en blind
      ved Vejen og tiggede.
 36.  Og da han hørte en Skare gå forbi, spurgte han, hvad dette var.
 37.  Men de fortalte ham, at Jesus af Nazareth kom forbi.
 38.  Og han råbte og sagde:"Jesus, du Davids Søn,forbarm dig over
      mig!"
 39.  Og de, som gik foran, truede ham, for at han skulde tie; men han
      råbte meget stærkere: "Du Davids Søn, forbarm dig over mig!"
 40.  Og Jesus stod stille og bød, at han skulde føres til ham; men da
      han kom nær til ham, spurgte han ham og sagde:
 41.  "Hvad vil du, at jeg skal gøre for dig?" Men han sagde: "Herre!
      at jeg må blive seende."
 42.  Og Jesus sagde til ham: "Bliv seende! din Tro har frelst dig."
 43.  Og straks blev han seende, og han fulgte ham og priste Gud; og
      hele Folket lovpriste Gud, da de så det.

Lukas 19

  1.  Og han kom ind i Jeriko og drog derigennem.
  2.  Og se, der var en Mand, som hed Zakæus; han var Overtolder, og
      han var rig.
  3.  Og han søgte at få at se, hvem der var Jesus, og kunde ikke for
      Skaren, fordi han var lille af Vækst.
  4.  Og han løb forud og steg op i et Morbær Figentræ, for at han
      kunde se ham; thi han skulde komme frem ad den Vej.
  5.  Og da Jesus kom til Stedet, så han op og blev ham var og sagde
      til ham: "Zakæus! skynd dig og stig ned; thi jeg skal i Dag
      blive i dit Hus."
  6.  Og han skyndte sig og steg ned og tog imod ham med Glæde.
  7.  Og da de så det, knurrede de alle og sagde: "Han er gået ind for
      at tage Herberge hos en syndig Mand."
  8.  Men Zakæus stod frem og sagde til Herren: "Se, Herre! Halvdelen
      af min Ejendom giver jeg de fattige; og dersom jeg har besveget
      nogen for noget, da giver jeg det fire Fold igen."
  9.  Men Jesus sagde til ham: "I Dag er der blevet dette Hus Frelse
      til Del, efterdi også han er en Abrahams Søn;
 10.  thi Menneskesønnen er kommen for at søge og frelse det
      fortabte."

 11.  Men medens de hørte på dette, fortsatte han og sagde en
      Lignelse, fordi han var nær ved Jerusalem, og de mente, at Guds
      Rige skulde straks komme til Syne.
 12.  Han sagde da: "En højbåren Mand drog til et fjernt Land for at
      få Kongemagt og vende tilbage igen.
 13.  Men han kaldte ti af sine Tjenere og gav dem ti Pund og sagde
      til dem: Købslår dermed, indtil jeg kommer.
 14.  Men hans Medborgere hadede ham og skikkede Sendebud efter ham og
      lod sige: Vi ville ikke, at denne skal være Konge over os.
 15.  Og det skete, da han kom igen, efter at han havde fået
      Kongemagten, sagde han, at disse Tjenere, hvem han havde givet
      Pengene, skulde kaldes for ham, for at han kunde få at vide,
      hvad hver havde vundet.
 16.  Og den første trådte frem og sagde: Herre! dit Pund har
      erhvervet ti Pund til.
 17.  Og han sagde til ham: Vel, du gode Tjener! efterdi du har været
      tro i det mindste, skal du have Magt over ti Byer.
 18.  Og den anden kom og sagde: Herre! dit Pund har indbragt fem
      Pund.
 19.  Men han sagde også til denne: Og du skal være over fem Byer.
 20.  Og en anden kom og sagde: Herre! se, her er dit Pund, som jeg
      har haft liggende i et Tørklæde.
 21.  Thi jeg frygtede for dig, efterdi du er en streng Mand; du
      tager, hvad du ikke lagde, og høster, hvad du ikke såede.
 22.  Han siger til ham: Efter din egen Mund dømmer jeg dig, du onde
      Tjener! Du vidste, at jeg er en streng Mand, som tager, hvad jeg
      ikke lagde, og høster, hvad jeg ikke såede;
 23.  hvorfor gav du da ikke mine Penge til Vekselbordet, så jeg ved
      min Hjemkomst kunde have krævet dem med Rente?
 24.  Og han sagde til dem, som stode hos: Tager Pundet fra ham, og
      giver det til ham, som har de ti Pund.
 25.  Og de sagde til ham: Herre! han har ti Pund.
 26.  Jeg siger eder, at enhver, som har, ham skal der gives; men den,
      som ikke har, fra ham skal endog det tages, som han har.
 27.  Men fører disse mine Fjender hid, som ikke vilde, at jeg skulde
      være Konge over dem, og hugger dem ned for mine Øjne!"

 28.  Og da han havde sagt dette, gik han foran og drog op til
      Jerusalem.
 29.  Og det skete, da han nærmede sig til Bethfage og Bethania ved
      det Bjerg, som kaldes Oliebjerget, udsendte han to af sine
      Disciple og sagde:
 30.  "Går hen til den Landsby, som ligger lige for eder. Når I komme
      derind, skulle I finde et Føl bundet, på hvilket der endnu
      aldrig har siddet noget Menneske; og løser det, og fører det
      hid!
 31.  Og dersom nogen spørger eder: Hvorfor løse I det? da skulle I
      sige således: Herren har Brug for det."
 32.  Men de udsendte gik hen og fandt det, ligesom han havde sagt
      dem.
 33.  Men da de løste Føllet, sagde dets Herrer til dem: "Hvorfor løse
      I Føllet?"
 34.  Og de sagde: "Herren har Brug for det."
 35.  Og de førte det til Jesus, og de lagde deres Klæder på Føllet og
      lod Jesus sætte sig derpå.
 36.  Og da han drog frem, bredte de deres Klæder under ham på Vejen.
 37.  Men da han nu nærmede sig til Nedgangen fra Oliebjerget,
      begyndte hele Disciplenes Mængde med Glæde at prise Gud med høj
      Røst for alle de kraftige Gerninger, som de havde set, og de
      sagde:
 38.  "Velsignet være Kongen, som kommer, i Herrens Navn! Fred i
      Himmelen, og Ære i det højeste!"
 39.  Og nogle af Farisæerne i Skaren sagde til ham: "Mester!
      irettesæt dine Disciple!"
 40.  Og han svarede og sagde til dem: "Jeg siger eder, at hvis disse
      tie, skulle Stenene råbe."

 41.  Og da han kom nær til og så Staden, græd han over den og sagde:
 42.  "Vidste dog også du, ja, selv på denne din Dag, hvad der tjener
      til din Fred! Men nu er det skjult for dine Øjne.
 43.  Thi der skal komme Dage over dig, da dine Fjender skulle kaste
      en Vold op omkring dig og omringe dig og trænge dig alle Vegne
      fra;
 44.  og de skulle lægge dig helt øde og dine Børn i dig og ikke lade
      Sten på Sten tilbage i dig, fordi du ikke kendte din Besøgelses
      Tid."

 45.  Og han gik ind i Helligdommen og begyndte at uddrive dem, som
      solgte,
 46.  og sagde til dem: "Der er skrevet: Og mit Hus er et Bedehus; men
      I have gjort det til en Røverkule."
 47.  Og han lærte daglig i Helligdommen; men Ypperstepræsterne og de
      skriftkloge og de første i Folket søgte at slå ham ihjel.
 48.  Og de fandt ikke, hvad de skulde gøre; thi hele Folket hang ved
      ham og hørte ham.

Lukas 20

  1.  Og det skete på en af de Dage, medens han lærte folket i
      Helligdommen og forkyndte Evangeliet, da trådte
      Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge tillige med de Ældste hen
      til ham.
  2.  Og de talte til ham og sagde: "Sig os, af hvad Magt gør du disse
      Ting, eller hvem er det, som har givet dig denne Magt?"
  3.  Men han svarede og sagde til dem: "Også jeg vil spørge eder om
      en Ting, siger mig det:
  4.  Johannes's Dåb, var den fra Himmelen eller fra Mennesker?"
  5.  Men de overvejede med hverandre og sagde: "Sige vi: Fra
      Himmelen, da vil han sige: Hvorfor troede I ham ikke?
  6.  Men sige vi: Fra Mennesker, da vil hele Folket stene os; thi det
      er overbevist om, at Johannes var en Profet."
  7.  Og de svarede, at de vidste ikke hvorfra.
  8.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "Så siger ikke heller jeg eder, af hvad
      Magt jeg gør disse Ting."

  9.  Men han begyndte at sige denne Lignelse til Folket: "En Mand
      plantede en Vingård og lejede den ud til Vingårdsmænd og drog
      udenlands for lange Tider.
 10.  Og da Tiden kom, sendte han en Tjener til Vingårdsmændene, for
      at de skulde give ham af Vingårdens Frugt; men Vingårdsmændene
      sloge ham og sendte ham tomhændet bort.
 11.  Og han sendte fremdeles en anden Tjener; men de sloge også ham
      og forhånede ham og sendte ham tomhændet bort.
 12.  Og han sendte fremdeles en tredje; men også ham sårede de og
      kastede ham ud.
 13.  Men Vingårdens Herre sagde: Hvad skal jeg gøre? Jeg vil sende
      min Søn, den elskede; de ville dog vel undse sig, for ham.
 14.  Men da Vingårdsmændene så ham, rådsloge de indbyrdes og sagde:
      Det er Arvingen; lader os slå ham ihjel, for at Arven kan blive
      vor.
 15.  Og de kastede ham ud af Vingården og sloge ham ihjel. Hvad vil
      nu Vingårdens Herre gøre ved dem?
 16.  Han vil komme og ødelægge disse Vingårdsmænd og give Vingården
      til andre." Men da de hørte det, sagde de: "Det ske aldrig!"
 17.  Men han så på dem og sagde: "Hvad er da dette, som er skrevet:
      Den Sten, som Bygningsmændene forkastede, den er bleven til en
      Hovedhjørnesten?
 18.  Hver, som falder på denne Sten, skal slå sig sønder; men hvem
      den falder på, ham skal den knuse."
 19.  Og Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge søgte at lægge Hånd på
      ham i den samme Time, men de frygtede for Folket; thi de
      forstode, at han sagde denne Lignelse imod dem.

 20.  Og de toge Vare på ham og udsendte Lurere, der anstillede sig,
      som om de vare retfærdige, for at fange ham i Ord, så de kunde
      overgive ham til Øvrigheden og Landshøvdingens Magt.
 21.  Og de spurgte ham og sagde: "Mester! vi vide, at du taler og
      lærer Rettelig og ikke ser på Personer, men lærer Guds Vej i
      Sandhed.
 22.  Er det os tilladt at give Kejseren Skat eller ej?"
 23.  Men da han mærkede deres Træskhed, sagde han til dem: "Hvorfor
      friste I mig?
 24.  Viser mig en Denar"; hvis Billede og Overskrift bærer den?" Men
      de svarede og sagde: "Kejserens."
 25.  Men han sagde til dem: "Så giver da Kejseren, hvad Kejserens er,
      og Gud, hvad Guds er."
 26.  Og de kunde ikke fange ham i Ord i Folkets Påhør, og de
      forundrede sig over hans Svar og tav.

 27.  Men nogle af Saddukæerne, som nægte, at der er Opstandelse, kom
      til ham og spurgte ham og sagde:
 28.  "Mester! Moses har foreskrevet os: Dersom en har en Broder, som
      er gift, og denne dør barnløs, da skal hans Broder tage Hustruen
      og oprejse sin Broder Afkom.
 29.  Nu var der syv Brødre; og den første tog en Hustru og døde
      barnløs.
 30.  Ligeså den anden.
 31.  Og den tredje tog hende, og således også alle syv; de døde uden
      at efterlade Børn.
 32.  Men til sidst døde også Hustruen.
 33.  Hvem af dem får hende så til Hustru i Opstandelsen? thi de have
      alle syv haft hende til Hustru."
 34.  Og Jesus sagde til dem: "Denne Verdens Børn tage til Ægte og
      bortgiftes;
 35.  men de, som agtes værdige til at få Del i hin Verden og i
      Opstandelsen fra de døde, tage hverken til Ægte eller
      bortgiftes.
 36.  Thi de kunne ikke mere dø; thi de ere Engle lige og ere Guds
      Børn, idet de ere Opstandelsens Børn.
 37.  Men at de døde oprejses, har også Moses givet til Kende i Stedet
      om Tornebusken, når han kalder Herren: Abrahams Gud og Isaks Gud
      og Jakobs Gud.
 38.  Men han er ikke dødes, men levendes Gud; thi for ham leve de
      alle."
 39.  Men nogle af de skriftkloge svarede og sagde: "Mester! du talte
      vel."
 40.  Og de turde ikke mere spørge ham om noget.

 41.  Men han sagde til dem: "Hvorledes siger man, at Kristus er
      Davids Søn?
 42.  David selv siger jo i Salmernes Bog: Herren sagde til min Herre:
      Sæt dig ved min højre Hånd,
 43.  indtil jeg får lagt dine Fjender som en Skammel for dine Fødder.
 44.  Altså kalder David ham en Herre, hvorledes er han da hans Søn?"

 45.  Men i hele Folkets Påhør sagde han til Disciplene:
 46.  "Vogter eder for de skriftkloge. som gerne ville gå i lange
      Klæder og holde af at lade sig hilse på Torvene og at have de
      fornemste Pladser i Synagogerne og at sidde øverst til Bords ved
      Måltiderne,
 47.  de, som opæde Enkers Huse og på Skrømt bede længe; disse skulle
      få des hårdere Dom."

Lukas 21

  1.  Men idet han så op, fik han Øje på de rige, som lagde deres
      Gaver i Tempelblokken.
  2.  Men han så en fattig Enke. som lagde to Skærve deri.
  3.  Og han sagde: "Sandelig, siger jeg eder, at denne fattige Enke
      lagde mere i end de alle.
  4.  Thi alle disse lagde af deres Overflod hen til Gaverne; men hun
      lagde af sin Fattigdom al sin Ejendom, som hun havde."

  5.  Og da nogle sagde om Helligdommen, at den var prydet med smukke
      Sten og Tempelgaver. sagde han:
  6.  "Disse Ting, som I se - der skal komme Dage, da der ikke lades
      Sten på Sten, som jo skal nedbrydes."
  7.  Men de spurgte ham og sagde: "Mester! når skal dette da ske? og
      hvad er Tegnet på, når dette skal ske?"
  8.  Men han sagde: "Ser til, at I ikke blive forførte; thi mange
      skulle på mit Navn komme og sige: Det er mig, og: Tiden er
      kommen nær. Går ikke efter dem!
  9.  Men når I høre om Krige og Oprør, da forskrækkes ikke; thi dette
      må først ske, men Enden er der ikke straks."
 10.  Da sagde han til dem: "Folk skal rejse sig imod Folk, og Rige
      imod Rige.
 11.  Og store Jordskælv skal der være her og der og Hungersnød og
      Pest, og der skal ske frygtelige Ting og store Tegn fra
      Himmelen.
 12.  Men forud for alt dette skulle de lægge Hånd på eder og forfølge
      eder og overgive eder til Synagoger og Fængsler, og I skulle
      føres frem for Konger og Landshøvdinger for mit Navns Skyld.
 13.  Det skal falde ud for eder til Vidnesbyrd.
 14.  Lægger det da på Hjerte, at I ikke forud skulle overtænke,
      hvorledes I skulde forsvare eder.
 15.  Thi jeg, vil give eder Mund og Visdom, som alle eders
      Modstandere ikke skulle kunne modstå eller modsige.
 16.  Men I skulle endog forrådes af Forældre og Brødre og Frænder og
      Venner, og de skulle slå nogle af eder ihjel.
 17.  Og I skulle hades af alle for mit Navns Skyld.
 18.  Og ikke et Hår på eders Hoved skal gå tabt.
 19.  Ved eders Udholdenhed skulle I vinde eders Sjæle.
 20.  Men når I se Jerusalem omringet af Krigshære, da forstår, at
      dens Ødelæggelse er kommen nær.
 21.  Da skulle de, som ere i Judæa, fly til Bjergene; og de, som ere
      inde i Staden, skulle vige bort derfra; og de, som ere på
      Landet, skulle ikke gå ind i den.
 22.  Thi disse ere Hævnens Dage, da alt, hvad skrevet er, skal
      opfyldes.
 23.  Men ve de frugtsommelige og dem, som give Die, i de Dage; thi
      der skal være stor Nød på Jorden og Vrede over dette Folk.
 24.  Og de skulle falde for Sværdets Od og føres fangne til alle
      Hedningerne; og Jerusalem skal nedtrædes af Hedningerne, indtil
      Hedningernes Tider fuldkommes.
 25.  Og der skal ske Tegn i Sol og Måne og Stjerner, og på Jorden
      skulle Folkene ængstes i Fortvivlelse over Havets og Bølgernes
      Brusen,
 26.  medens Mennesker forsmægte af Frygt og Forventning om de Ting,
      som komme over Jorderige; thi Himmelens Kræfter skulle rystes.
 27.  Og da skulle de se Menneskesønnen komme i Sky med Kraft og megen
      Herlighed.
 28.  Men når disse Ting begynde at ske, da ser op og opløfter eders
      Hoveder, efterdi eders Forløsning stunder til."
 29.  Og han sagde dem en Lignelse: "Ser Figentræet og alle Træerne;
 30.  når de alt springe ud, da se I og skønne af eder selv, at
      Sommeren nu er nær.
 31.  Således skulle også I, når I se disse Ting ske, skønne, at Guds
      Rige er nær.
 32.  Sandelig, siger jeg eder, at denne Slægt skal ingenlunde forgå,
      førend det er sket alt sammen.
 33.  Himmelen og Jorden skulle forgå; men mine Ord skulle ingenlunde
      forgå.
 34.  Men vogter eder, at eders Hjerter ikke, nogen Tid besværes af
      Svir og Drukkenskab og timelige Bekymringer, så hin dag kommer
      pludseligt over eder som en Snare.
 35.  Thi komme skal den over alle dem, der bo på hele Jordens Flade.
 36.  Og våger og beder til enhver Tid, for at I må blive i Stand til
      at undfly alle disse Ting, som skulle ske, og bestå for
      Menneskesønnen."
 37.  Men han lærte om Dagene i Helligdommen, men om Nætterne gik han
      ud og overnattede på det Bjerg, som kaldes Oliebjerget.
 38.  Og hele Folket kom årle til ham i Helligdommen for at høre ham.

Lukas 22

  1.  Men de usyrede Brøds Højtid, som kaldes Påske, nærmede sig.
  2.  Og Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge søgte, hvorledes de kunde
      slå ham ihjel; thi de frygtede for Folket.
  3.  Men Satan gik ind i Judas, som kaldes Iskariot og var en af de
      tolv.
  4.  Og han gik hen og talte med Ypperstepræsterne og Høvedsmændene
      om, hvorledes han vilde forråde ham til dem.
  5.  Og de bleve glade og lovede at give ham Penge.
  6.  Og han tilsagde det; og han søgte Lejlighed til at forråde ham
      til dem uden Opløb.

  7.  Men de usyrede Brøds Dag kom, på hvilken man skulde slagte
      Påskelammet.
  8.  Og han udsendte Peter og Johannes og sagde: "Går hen og bereder
      os Påskelammet, at vi kunne spise det."
  9.  Men de sagde til ham: "Hvor vil du, at vi skulle berede det?"
 10.  Men han sagde til dem: "Se, når I ere komne ind i Staden, skal
      der møde eder en Mand, som bærer en Vandkrukke; følger ham til
      Huset, hvor han går ind,
 11.  og I skulle sige til Husbonden i Huset: Mesteren siger: Hvor er
      det Herberge, hvor jeg kan spise Påskelammet med mine Disciple?
 12.  Og han skal vise eder en stor Sal opdækket; der skulle I berede
      det."
 13.  Og de gik hen og fandt det således, som han havde sagt dem; og
      de beredte Påskelammet.
 14.  Og da Timen kom, satte han sig til Bords, og Apostlene med ham.
 15.  Og han sagde til dem: "Jeg har hjerteligt længtes efter at spise
      dette Påskelam med eder, førend jeg lider.
 16.  Thi jeg siger eder, at jeg skal ingen Sinde mere spise det,
      førend det bliver fuldkommet i Guds Rige."
 17.  Og han tog en Kalk, takkede og sagde: "Tager dette, og deler det
      imellem eder!
 18.  Thi jeg siger eder, at fra nu af skal jeg ikke drikke af
      Vintræets Frugt, førend Guds Rige kommer."
 19.  Og han tog Brød, takkede og brød det og gav dem det og sagde:
      "Dette er mit Legeme, det, som gives for eder; gører dette til
      min Ihukommelse!"
 20.  Ligeså tog han også Kalken efter Aftensmåltidet og sagde: "Denne
      Kalk er den nye Pagt i mit Blod, det, som udgydes for eder.
 21.  Men se, hans Hånd, som forråder mig, er her på Bordet hos mig.
 22.  Thi Menneskesønnen går bort, som det er beskikket; dog ve det
      Menneske, ved hvem han bliver forrådt!"
 23.  Og de begyndte at spørge hverandre indbyrdes om, hvem af dem det
      dog kunde være, som skulde gøre dette.

 24.  Men der opstod også en Trætte iblandt dem om, hvem at dem der
      måtte synes at være den største.
 25.  Men han sagde til dem: "Folkenes Konger herske over dem, og de,
      som bruge Myndighed over dem, kaldes deres Velgørere.
 26.  I derimod ikke således; men den ældste iblandt eder blive som
      den yngste, og Føreren som den, der tjener.
 27.  Thi hvem er størst: den, som sidder til Bords? eller den, som
      tjener? Mon ikke den, som sidder til Bords? Men jeg er iblandt
      eder som den, der tjener.
 28.  Men I ere de, som have holdt ud med mig i mine Fristelser.
 29.  Og ligesom min Fader har tildelt mig Kongedømme, tildeler jeg
      eder
 30.  at skulle spise og drikke ved mit Bord i mit Rige og sidde på
      Troner og dømme Israels tolv Stammer."
 31.  Men Herren sagde: "Simon, Simon! se, Satan begærede eder for at
      sigte eder som Hvede.
 32.  Men jeg bad for dig, at din Tro ikke skal svigte; og når du
      engang omvender dig, da styrk dine Brødre!"
 33.  Men han sagde til ham: "Herre! jeg er rede til at gå med dig
      både i Fængsel og i Døden."
 34.  Men han sagde: "Peter! jeg siger dig: Hanen skal ikke gale i
      Dag, førend du tre Gange har nægtet, at du kender mig."

 35.  Og han sagde til dem: "Da jeg udsendte eder uden Pung og Taske
      og Sko, manglede I da noget?" Og de sagde: "Intet."
 36.  Men han sagde til dem: "Men nu, den, som har en Pung, tage den
      med, ligeså også en Taske; og den, som ikke har noget Sværd,
      sælge sin Kappe og købe et!
 37.  Thi jeg siger eder: Det, som er skrevet, bør opfyldes på mig,
      dette: "Og han blev regnet iblandt Overtrædere;" thi også med
      mig har det en Ende."
 38.  Men de sagde: "Herre! se, her er to Sværd." Men han sagde til
      dem: "Det er nok."

 39.  Og han gik ud og gik efter sin Sædvane til Oliebjerget; men også
      Disciplene fulgte ham.
 40.  Men da han kom til Stedet, sagde han til dem: "Beder om ikke at
      falde i Fristelse."
 41.  Og han rev sig løs fra dem, så meget som et Stenkast, og faldt
      på Knæ, bad og sagde:
 42.  "Fader, vilde du dog tage denne Kalk fra mig! dog ske ikke min
      Villie, men din!"
 43.  Men en Engel fra Himmelen viste sig for ham og styrkede ham.
 44.  Og da han var i Dødsangst, bad han heftigere; men hans Sved blev
      som Blodsdråber, der faldt ned på Jorden.
 45.  Og da han stod op fra Bønnen og kom til Disciplene, fandt han
      dem sovende af Bedrøvelse.
 46.  Og han sagde til dem: "Hvorfor sove I? Står op og beder, for at
      I ikke skulle falde i Fristelse."

 47.  Medens han endnu talte, se, da kom der en Skare; og han, som hed
      Judas, en af de tolv, gik foran dem og nærmede sig til Jesus for
      at kysse ham.
 48.  Men Jesus sagde til ham: "Judas! forråder du Menneskesønnen med
      et Kys?"
 49.  Men da de,som vare omkring ham, så, hvad der vilde ske, sagde
      de: "Herre! skulle vi slå til med Sværd?"
 50.  Og en af dem slog Ypperstepræstens Tjener og afhuggede hans
      højre Øre.
 51.  Men Jesus tog til Orde og sagde: "Lad dem gøre også dette!" Og
      han rørte ved hans Øre og lægte ham.
 52.  Men Jesus sagde til Ypperstepræsterne og Høvedsmændene for
      Helligdommen og de ældste, som vare komne til ham: "I ere gåede
      ud som imod en Røver med Sværd og Knipler.
 53.  Da jeg var daglig hos eder i Helligdommen, udrakte I ikke
      Hænderne imod mig; men dette er eders Time og Mørkets Magt."

 54.  Og de grebe ham og førte ham bort og bragte ham ind i
      Ypperstepræstens Hus; men Peter fulgte efter i Frastand.
 55.  Og de tændte en Ild midt i Gården og satte sig sammen, og Peter
      sad midt iblandt dem.
 56.  Men en Pige så ham sidde i Lysskæret og stirrede på ham og
      sagde: "Også denne var med ham."
 57.  Men han fornægtede ham og sagde: "Jeg kender ham ikke. Kvinde!"
 58.  Og lidt derefter så en anden ham og sagde: "Også du er en af
      dem." Men Peter sagde: "Menneske! det er jeg ikke."
 59.  Og omtrent en Time derefter forsikrede en anden det og sagde: "I
      Sandhed, også denne var med ham; han er jo også en Galilæer."
 60.  Men Peter sagde: "Menneske! jeg forstår ikke, hvad du siger." Og
      straks, medens han endnu talte. galede Hanen.
 61.  Og Herren vendte sig og så på Peter; og Peter kom Herrens Ord i
      Hu, hvorledes han havde sagt til ham: "Førend Hanen galer i Dag,
      skal du fornægte mig tre Gange."
 62.  Og han gik udenfor og græd bitterligt.

 63.  Og de Mænd, som holdt Jesus, spottede ham og sloge ham;
 64.  og de kastede et Klæde over ham og spurgte ham og sagde:
      "Profeter! hvem var det, som slog dig?"
 65.  Og mange andre Ting sagde de spottende til ham.
 66.  Og da det blev Dag, samlede Folkets Ældste sig og
      Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge, og de førte ham hen for
      deres Råd
 67.  og sagde: "Er du Kristus, da sig os det!" Men han sagde til dem:
      "Siger jeg eder det, tro I det ikke.
 68.  Og om jeg spørger, svare I mig ikke, ej heller løslade I mig.
 69.  Men fra nu af skal Menneskesønnen sidde ved Guds Krafts højre
      Hånd."
 70.  Men de sagde alle: "Er du da Guds Søn?" Og han sagde til dem: "I
      sige det; jeg er det."
 71.  Men de sagde: "Hvad have vi længere Vidnesbyrd nødig? vi have jo
      selv hørt det af hans Mund!"

Lukas 23

  1.  Og hele Mængden stod op og førte ham for Pilatus.
  2.  Og de begyndte at anklage ham og sagde: "Vi have fundet, at
      denne vildleder vort Folk og forbyder at give Kejseren Skat og
      siger om sig selv at han er Kristus, en Konge."
  3.  Men Pilatus spurgte ham og sagde: "Er du Jødernes Konge?" Og han
      svarede og sagde til ham: "Du siger det."
  4.  Men Pilatus sagde til Ypperstepræsterne og til Skarerne: "Jeg
      finder ingen Skyld hos dette Menneske."
  5.  Men de bleve ivrigere og sagde: "Han oprører Folket, idet han
      lærer over hele Judæa fra Galilæa af, hvor han begyndte, og lige
      hertil."
  6.  Men da Pilatus hørte om Galilæa, spurgte han, om Manden var en
      Galilæer.
  7.  Og da han fik at vide, at han var fra Herodes's Område, sendte
      han ham til Herodes, som også selv var i Jerusalem i disse Dage.
  8.  Men da Herodes så Jesus, blev han meget glad; thi han havde i
      lang Tid gerne villet se ham, fordi han hørte om ham, og han
      håbede at se et Tegn blive gjort af ham.
  9.  Og han gjorde ham mange Spørgsmål; men han svarede ham intet.
 10.  Men Ypperstepræsterne og de skriftkloge stode og anklagede ham
      heftigt.
 11.  Men da Herodes med sine Krigsfolk havde hånet og spottet ham,
      kastede han et prægtigt Klædebon om ham og sendte ham til
      Pilatus igen.
 12.  På den Dag bleve Herodes og Pilatus Venner med hinanden; thi de
      vare før i Fjendskab med hinanden.
 13.  Men Pilatus sammenkaldte Ypperstepræsterne og Rådsherrerne og
      Folket
 14.  og sagde til dem: "I have ført dette Menneske til mig som en,
      der forfører Folket til Frafald; og se. jeg har forhørt ham i
      eders Påhør og har ingen Skyld fundet hos dette Menneske i det,
      som I anklage ham for,
 15.  og Herodes ikke heller, thi han sendte ham tilbage fil os; og
      se, han har intet gjort som han er skyldig at dø for.
 16.  Derfor vil jeg revse ham og lade ham løs."
 17.  (Men han var nødt til at løslade dem een på Højtiden.)
 18.  Men de råbte alle sammen og sagde: "Bort med ham, men løslad os
      Barabbas!"
 19.  Denne var kastet i Fængsel for et Oprør, som var sket i Staden,
      og for Mord.
 20.  Og atter talte Pilatus til dem, da han gerne vilde løslade
      Jesus.
 21.  Men de råbte til ham og sagde: "Korsfæst, korsfæst ham!
 22.  Men han sagde tredje Gang til dem: "Hvad ondt har da denne gjort
      Jeg har ingen Dødsskyld fundet hos ham; derfor vil jeg revse ham
      og lade ham løs."
 23.  Men de trængte på med stærke Råb og forlangte, at han skulde
      korsfæstes; og deres Råb fik Overhånd.
 24.  Og Pilatus dømte, at deres Forlangende skulde opfyldes;
 25.  og han løslod den, de forlangte, som var kastet i Fængsel for
      Oprør og Mord; men Jesus overgav han til deres Villie.

 26.  Og da de førte ham bort, toge de fat på en vis Simon fra Kyrene,
      som kom fra Marken, og lagde Korset på ham, for at han skulde
      bære det bag efter Jesus.
 27.  Men der fulgte ham en stor Hob af Folket, og af Kvinder, som
      jamrede og græd over ham.
 28.  Men Jesus vendte sig om til dem og sagde: "I Jerusalems Døtre!
      græder ikke over mig, men græder over eder selv og over eders
      Børn!
 29.  Thi se, der kommer Dage, da man skal sige: Salige ere de
      ufrugtbare og de Liv, som ikke fødte, og de Bryster, som ikke
      gave Die.
 30.  Da skulle de begynde at sige til Bjergene: Falder over os! og
      til Højene: Skjuler os!
 31.  Thi gør man dette ved det grønne Træ, hvad vil da ske med det
      tørre?"
 32.  Men der blev også to andre Misdædere førte ud for at henrettes
      med ham.
 33.  Og da de vare komne til det Sted, som kaldes "Hovedskal",
      korsfæstede de ham der, og Misdæderne, den ene ved hans højre,
      og den anden ved hans venstre Side.
 34.  Men Jesus sagde: "Fader! forlad dem; thi de vide ikke, hvad de
      gøre." Men de delte hans Klæder imellem sig ved Lodkastning.
 35.  Og Folket stod og så til; men også Rådsherrerne spottede ham og
      sagde: "Andre har han frelst, lad ham frelse sig selv, dersom
      han er Guds Kristus, den udvalgte."
 36.  Men også Stridsmændene spottede ham, idet de trådte til, rakte
      ham Eddike og sagde:
 37.  "Dersom du er Jødernes Konge, da frels dig selv!"
 38.  Men der var også sat en Overskrift over ham (skreven på Græsk og
      Latin og Hebraisk): "Denne er Jødernes Konge."
 39.  Men en af de ophængte Misdædere spottede ham og sagde: "Er du
      ikke Kristus? Frels dig selv og os!"
 40.  Men den anden svarede og irettesatte ham og sagde: "Frygter
      heller ikke du Gud, da du er under den samme Dom?
 41.  Og vi ere det med Rette; thi vi få igen, hvad vore Gerninger
      have forskyldt; men denne gjorde intet uskikkeligt."
 42.  Og han sagde: "Jesus! kom mig i Hu, når du kommer i dit Rige!"
 43.  Og han sagde til ham: "Sandelig, siger jeg dig, i Dag skal du
      være med mig i Paradiset."
 44.  Og det var nu ved den sjette Time, og der blev Mørke over hele
      Landet indtil den niende Time,
 45.  idet Solen formørkedes; og Forhænget i Templet splittedes midt
      over.
 46.  Og Jesus råbte med høj Røst og sagde: "Fader! i dine Hænder
      befaler jeg min Ånd;" og da han havde sagt det, udåndede han.
 47.  Men da Høvedsmanden så det, som skete, gav han Gud Æren og
      sagde: "I Sandhed, dette Menneske var retfærdigt."
 48.  Og alle Skarerne, som vare komne sammen til dette Skue, sloge
      sig for Brystet, da de så, hvad der skete, og vendte tilbage.
 49.  Men alle hans Kyndinge stode langt borte, ligeså de Kvinder, som
      fulgte med ham fra Galilæa, og så dette.

 50.  Og se, en Mand ved Navn Josef, som var Rådsherre, en god og
      retfærdig Mand,
 51.  han havde ikke samtykket i deres Råd og Gerning, han var fra
      Arimathæa, en jødisk By, og han forventede Guds Rige;
 52.  han gik til Pilatus og bad om Jesu Legeme.
 53.  Og han tog det ned og svøbte det i et fint Linklæde, og han
      lagde ham i en Grav, som var hugget i en Klippe, hvor endnu
      ingen nogen Sinde var lagt. 54 Og det var Beredelsesdag, og
      Sabbaten stundede til.
 55.  Men Kvinderne, som vare komne med ham fra Galilæa, fulgte efter
      og så Graven, og hvorledes hans Legeme blev lagt.
 56.  Og de vendte tilbage og beredte vellugtende Urter og Salver; og
      Sabbaten over holdt de sig stille efter Budet.

Lukas 24

  1.  Men på den første Dag i Ugen meget årle kom de til Graven og
      bragte de vellugtende Urter, som de havde beredt.
  2.  Og de fandt Stenen bortvæltet fra Graven.
  3.  Men da de gik derind, fandt de ikke den Herres Jesu Legeme.
  4.  Og det skete, da de vare tvivlrådige om dette, se, da stode to
      Mænd for dem i strålende Klædebon.
  5.  Men da de bleve forfærdede og bøjede deres Ansigter imod Jorden,
      sagde de til dem: "Hvorfor lede I efter den levende iblandt de
      døde?
  6.  Han er ikke her, men han er opstanden; kommer i Hu, hvorledes
      han talte til eder, medens han endnu var i Galilæa, og sagde,
  7.  at Menneskesønnen burde overgives i syndige Menneskers Hænder og
      korsfæstes og opstå på den tredje Dag."
  8.  Og de kom hans Ord i Hu.
  9.  Og de vendte tilbage fra Graven og kundgjorde alle disse Ting
      for de elleve og for alle de andre.
 10.  Men det var Maria Magdalene og Johanna og Maria, Jakobs Moder,
      og de øvrige Kvinder med dem; de sagde Apostlene disse Ting.
 11.  Og disse Ord kom dem for som løs Tale; og de troede dem ikke.
 12.  Men Peter stod op og løb til Graven; og da han kiggede derind
      ser han Linklæderne alene liggende der, og han gik hjem i Undren
      over det, som var sket.

 13.  Og se, to af dem vandrede på den samme Dag til en Landsby, som
      lå tresindstyve Stadier fra Jerusalem, dens Navn var Emmaus.
 14.  Og de talte med hinanden om alle disse Ting, som vare skete.
 15.  Og det skete, medens de samtalede og spurgte hinanden indbyrdes,
      da kom Jesus selv nær og vandrede med dem.
 16.  Men deres Øjne holdtes til, så de ikke kendte ham.
 17.  Men han sagde til dem: "Hvad er dette for Ord, som I skifte med
      hinanden på Vejen?" Og de standsede bedrøvede.
 18.  Men en af dem, som hed Kleofas, svarede og sagde til ham: "Er du
      alene fremmed i Jerusalem og ved ikke, hvad der er sket der i
      disse dage?"
 19.  Og han sagde til dem: "Hvilket?" Men de sagde til ham: "Det med
      Jesus af Nazareth, som var en Profet, mægtig i Gerning og Ord
      for Gud og alt Folket;
 20.  og hvorledes Ypperstepræsterne og vore Rådsherrer have overgivet
      ham til Dødsdom og korsfæstet ham.
 21.  Men vi håbede, at han var den, som skulde forløse Israel. Men
      med alt dette er det i Dag den tredje Dag, siden dette skete.
 22.  Men også nogle af vore Kvinder have forfærdet os, idet de kom
      årle til Graven,
 23.  og da de ikke fandt hans Legeme, kom de og sagde, at de havde
      også set et Syn af Engle, der sagde, at han lever.
 24.  Og nogle af vore gik hen til Graven, og de fandt det således,
      som Kvinderne havde sagt; men ham så de ikke."
 25.  Og han sagde til dem: "O I uforstandige og senhjertede til at
      tro på alt det, som Profeterne have talt!
 26.  Burde ikke Kristus lide dette og indgå til sin Herlighed?"
 27.  Og han begyndte fra Moses og fra alle Profeterne og udlagde dem
      i alle Skrifterne det, som handlede om ham.
 28.  Og de nærmede sig til Landsbyen, som de gik til; og han lod, som
      han vilde gå videre.
 29.  Og de nødte ham meget og sagde: "Bliv hos os; thi det er mod
      Aften, og Dagen hælder." Og han gik ind for at blive hos dem.
 30.  Og det skete, da han havde sat sig med dem til Bords, tog han
      Brødet, velsignede og brød det og gav dem det.
 31.  Da bleve deres Øjne åbnede, og de kendte ham; og han blev
      usynlig for dem.
 32.  Og de sagde til hinanden: "Brændte ikke vort Hjerte i os, medens
      han talte til os på Vejen og oplod os Skrifterne?"
 33.  Og de stode op i den samme Time og vendte tilbage til Jerusalem
      og fandt forsamlede de elleve og dem, som vare med dem, hvilke
      sagde:
 34.  "Herren er virkelig opstanden og set af Simon."
 35.  Og de fortalte, hvad der var sket på Vejen, og hvorledes han
      blev kendt af dem, idet han brød Brødet.

 36.  Men medens de talte dette, stod han selv midt iblandt dem; og
      han siger til dem: "Fred være med eder!"
 37.  Da forskrækkedes de og betoges af Frygt og mente, at de så en
      Ånd.
 38.  Og han sagde til dem: "Hvorfor ere I forfærdede? og hvorfor
      opstiger der Tvivl i eders Hjerter?
 39.  Ser mine Hænder og mine Fødder, at det er mig selv; føler på mig
      og ser; thi en Ånd har ikke Kød og Ben, som I se, at jeg har."
 40.  Og da han havde sagt dette, viste han dem sine Hænder og sine
      Fødder.
 41.  Men da de af Glæde herover endnu ikke kunde tro og undrede sig,
      sagde han til dem: "Have I her noget at spise?"
 42.  Og de gave ham et Stykke af en stegt Fisk.
 43.  Og han tog det og spiste det for deres Øjne.
 44.  Men han sagde til dem: "Dette er mine Ord, som jeg talte til
      eder, medens jeg endnu var hos eder, at de Ting bør alle sammen
      opfyldes, som ere skrevne om mig i Mose Lov og Profeterne og
      Salmerne."
 45.  Da oplod han deres Forstand til at forstå Skrifterne.
 46.  Og han sagde til dem: "Således er der skrevet, at Kristus skulde
      lide og opstå fra de døde på den tredje Dag,
 47.  og at der i hans Navn skal prædikes Omvendelse og Syndernes
      Forladelse for alle Folkeslagene og begyndes fra Jerusalem.
 48.  I ere Vidner om disse Ting.
 49.  Og se, jeg sender min Faders Forjættelse over eder; men I skulle
      blive i Staden, indtil I blive iførte Kraft fra det høje."

 50.  Men han førte dem ud til hen imod Bethania, og han opløftede
      sine Hænder og velsignede dem.
 51.  Og det skete, idet han velsignede dem, skiltes han fra dem og
      opløftedes til Himmelen.
 52.  Og efter at have tilbedt ham vendte de tilbage til Jerusalem med
      stor Glæde.
 53.  Og de vare stedse i Helligdommen og priste Gud.


Johannes

Johannes 1

  1.  I Begyndelsen var Ordet, og Ordet var hos Gud, og Ordet var Gud.
  2.  Dette var i Begyndelsen hos Gud.
  3.  Alle Ting ere blevne til ved det, og uden det blev end ikke een
      Ting til af det, som er.
  4.  I det var Liv, og Livet var Menneskenes Lys.
  5.  Og Lyset skinner i Mørket, og Mørket begreb det ikke.
  6.  Der kom et Menneske, udsendt fra Gud, hans Navn var Johannes.
  7.  Denne kom til et Vidnesbyrd, for at han skulde vidne om Lyset,
      for at alle skulde tro ved ham.
  8.  Han var ikke Lyset, men han skulde vidne om Lyset.
  9.  Det sande Lys, der oplyser hvert Menneske, var ved at komme til
      Verden.
 10.  Han var i Verden, og Verden er bleven til ved ham, og Verden
      kendte ham ikke.
 11.  Han kom til sit eget, og hans egne toge ikke imod ham.
 12.  Men så mange, som toge imod ham, dem gav han Magt til at vorde
      Guds Børn, dem, som tro på hans Navn;
 13.  hvilke ikke bleve fødte af Blod, ej heller af Køds Villie, ej
      heller af Mands Villie, men af Gud.
 14.  Og Ordet blev Kød og tog Bolig iblandt os, og vi så hans
      Herlighed, en Herlighed, som en enbåren Søn har den fra sin
      Fader, fuld af Nåde og Sandhed.
 15.  Johannes vidner om ham og råber og siger: "Ham var det, om hvem
      jeg sagde: Den, som kommer efter mig, er kommen foran mig; thi
      han var før mig."
 16.  Thi af hans Fylde have vi alle modtaget, og det Nåde over Nåde.
 17.  Thi Loven blev given ved Moses; Nåden og Sandheden er kommen ved
      Jesus Kristus.
 18.  Ingen har nogen Sinde set Gud; den enbårne Søn, som er i
      Faderens Skød, han har kundgjort ham.

 19.  Og dette er Johannes's Vidnesbyrd, da Jøderne sendte Præster og
      Leviter ud fra Jerusalem, for at de skulde spørge ham: "Hvem er
      du?"
 20.  Og han bekendte og nægtede ikke, og han bekendte: "Jeg er ikke
      Kristus."
 21.  Og de spurgte ham: "Hvad da? Er du Elias?" Han siger: "Det er
      jeg ikke." "Er du Profeten?" Og han svarede: "Nej."
 22.  Da sagde de til ham: "Hvem er du? For at vi kunne give dem Svar,
      som have udsendt os; hvad siger du om dig selv?"
 23.  Han sagde: "Jeg er en Røst af en, som råber i Ørkenen: Jævner
      Herrens Vej, som Profeten Esajas har sagt."
 24.  Og de vare udsendte fra Farisæerne,
 25.  og de spurgte ham og sagde til ham: "Hvorfor døber du da, dersom
      du ikke er Kristus, ej heller Elias, ej heller Profeten?"
 26.  Johannes svarede dem og sagde: "Jeg døber med Vand; midt iblandt
      eder står den, I ikke kende,
 27.  han som kommer efter mig, hvis Skotvinge jeg ikke er værdig at
      løse."
 28.  Dette skete i Bethania hinsides Jordan, hvor Johannes døbte.
 29.  Den næste Dag ser han Jesus komme til sig, og han siger: "Se det
      Guds Lam, som bærer Verdens Synd!
 30.  Han er den, om hvem jeg sagde: Efter mig kommer en Mand, som er
      kommen foran mig; thi han var før mig.
 31.  Og jeg kendte ham ikke; men for at han skulde åbenbares for
      Israel, derfor er jeg kommen og døber med Vand."
 32.  Og Johannes vidnede og sagde: "Jeg har set Ånden dale ned som en
      Due fra Himmelen, og den blev over ham.
 33.  Og jeg kendte ham ikke; men den, som sendte mig for at døbe med
      Vand, han sagde til mig: Den, som du ser Ånden dale ned over og
      blive over, han er den, som døber med den Helligånd.
 34.  Og jeg har set det og har vidnet, at denne er Guds Søn."

 35.  Den næste Dag stod Johannes der atter og to af hans Disciple.
 36.  Og idet han så på Jesus,som gik der,siger han: "Se det Guds
      Lam!"
 37.  Og de to Disciple hørte ham tale, og de fulgte Jesus.
 38.  Men Jesus vendte sig om, og da han så dem følge sig, siger han
      til dem: "Hvad søge I efter?" Men de sagde til ham: "Rabbi!
      (hvilket udlagt betyder Mester) hvor opholder du dig?"
 39.  Han siger til dem: "Kommer og ser!" De kom da og så, hvor han
      opholdt sig, og de bleve hos ham den Dag; det var ved den Tiende
      Time.
 40.  Den ene af de to, som havde hørt Johannes's Ord og havde fulgt
      ham, var Andreas, Simon Peters Broder.
 41.  Denne finder først sin egen Broder Simon og siger til ham: "Vi
      have fundet Messias" (hvilket er udlagt: Kristus).
 42.  Og han førte ham til Jesus. Jesus så på ham og sagde: "Du er
      Simon, Johannes's Søn; du skal hedde Kefas" (det er udlagt:
      Petrus).
 43.  Den næste Dag vilde han drage derfra til Galilæa; og han finder
      Filip. Og Jesus siger til ham: "Følg mig!"
 44.  Men Filip var fra Bethsajda, fra Andreas's og Peters By.
 45.  Filip finder Nathanael og siger til ham: "Vi have fundet ham,
      hvem Moses i Loven og ligeså Profeterne have skrevet om, Jesus,
      Josefs Søn, fra Nazareth."
 46.  Og Nathanael sagde til ham: "Kan noget godt være fra Nazareth?"
      Filip siger til ham: "Kom og se!"
 47.  Jesus så Nathanael komme til sig, og han siger om ham: "Se, det
      er sandelig en Israelit, i hvem der ikke er Svig."
 48.  Nathanael siger til ham: "Hvorfra kender du mig?" Jesus svarede
      og sagde til ham: "Førend Filip kaldte dig, så jeg dig, medens
      du var under Figentræet."
 49.  Nathanael svarede ham: "Rabbi! du er Guds Søn, du er Israels
      Konge."
 50.  Jesus svarede og sagde til ham: "Tror du, fordi jeg sagde dig,
      at jeg så dig under Figentræet? Du skal se større Ting end
      disse."
 51.  Og han siger til ham: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, I
      skulle fra nu af se Himmelen åbnet og Guds Engle stige op og
      stige ned over Menneskesønnen."

Johannes 2

  1.  Og på den tredje Dag var der et Bryllup i Kana i Galilæa; og
      Jesu Moder var der.
  2.  Men også Jesus og hans Disciple bleve budne til Brylluppet.
  3.  Og da Vinen slap op, siger Jesu Moder til ham: "De have ikke
      Vin."
  4.  Jesus siger til hende: "Kvinde! hvad vil du mig? min Time er
      endnu ikke kommen."
  5.  Hans Moder siger til Tjenerne: "Hvad som han siger eder, det
      skulle I gøre."
  6.  Men der var der efter Jødernes Renselsesskik fremsat seks
      Vandkar af Sten, som rummede hvert to eller tre Spande.
  7.  Jesus siger til dem: "Fylder Vandkarrene med Vand; " og de
      fyldte dem indtil det øverste.
  8.  Og han siger til dem: "Øser nu og bærer til Køgemesteren; " og
      de bare det til ham.
  9.  Men da Køgemesteren smagte Vandet, som var blevet Vin, og ikke
      vidste, hvorfra det kom (men Tjenerne, som havde øst Vandet,
      vidste det), kalder Køgemesteren på Brudgommen og siger til ham:
 10.  "Hvert Menneske sætter først den gode Vin frem, og når de ere
      blevne drukne, da den ringere; du har gemt den gode Vin indtil
      nu."
 11.  Denne Begyndelse på sine Tegn gjorde Jesus i Kana i Galilæa, og
      han åbenbarede sin Herlighed; og hans Disciple troede på ham.

 12.  Derefter drog han ned til Kapernaum, han og hans Moder og hans
      Brødre og hans Disciple, og de bleve der ikke mange Dage.

 13.  Og Jødernes Påske var nær, og Jesus drog op til Jerusalem.
 14.  Og han fandt siddende i Helligdommen dem, som solgte Okser og
      Får og Duer, og Vekselerne.
 15.  Og han gjorde en Svøbe af Reb og drev dem alle ud af
      Helligdommen, både Fårene og Okserne, og han spredte
      Vekselerernes Småpenge og væltede Bordene.
 16.  Og han sagde til dem, som solgte duer: "Tager dette bort herfra;
      gører ikke min Faders Hus til en Købmandsbod!"
 17.  Hans Disciple kom i Hu, at der er skrevet: "Nidkærheden for dit
      Hus vil fortære mig."
 18.  Da svarede Jøderne og sagde til ham: "Hvad viser du os for et
      Tegn, efterdi du gør dette?"
 19.  Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Nedbryder dette Tempel, og i
      tre Dage vil jeg oprejse det."
 20.  Da sagde Jøderne: "I seks og fyrretyve År er der bygget på dette
      Tempel, og du vil oprejse det i tre Dage?"
 21.  Men han talte om sit Legemes Tempel.
 22.  Da han så var oprejst fra de døde, kom hans Disciple i Hu, at
      han havde sagt dette; og de troede Skriften og det Ord, som
      Jesus havde sagt.
 23.  Men da han var i Jerusalem i Påsken på Højtiden, troede mange på
      hans Navn, da de så hans Tegn, som han gjorde.
 24.  Men Jesus selv betroede sig ikke til dem, fordi han kendte alle,
 25.  og fordi han ikke havde nødig, at nogen skulde vidne om
      Mennesket; thi han vidste selv, hvad der var i Mennesket.

Johannes 3

  1.  Men der var en Mand af Farisæerne, han hed Nikodemus, en
      Rådsherre iblandt Jøderne.
  2.  Denne kom til ham om Natten og sagde til ham: "Rabbi! vi vide.
      at du er en Lærer kommen fra Gud; thi ingen kan gøre disse Tegn,
      som du gør, uden Gud er med ham."
  3.  Jesus svarede og sagde til ham: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg
      dig.  uden nogen bliver født på ny, kan han ikke se Guds Rige."
  4.  Nikodemus siger til ham: "Hvorledes kan et Menneske fødes, når
      han er gammel? Mon han kan anden Gang komme ind i sin Moders Liv
      og fødes?"
  5.  Jesus svarede: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg dig, uden nogen
      bliver født af Vand og Ånd, kan han ikke komme ind i Guds Rige.
  6.  Hvad der er født af Kødet, er Kød; og hvad der er født af Ånden,
      er Ånd.
  7.  Forundre dig ikke over, at jeg sagde til dig: I må fødes på ny.
  8.  Vinden blæser, hvorhen den vil, og du hører dens Susen, men du
      ved ikke, hvorfra den kommer, og hvor den farer hen; således er
      det med hver den, som er født af Ånden."
  9.  Nikodemus svarede og sagde til ham: "Hvorledes kan dette ske?"
 10.  Jesus svarede og sagde til ham: "Er du Israels Lærer og forstår
      ikke dette?
 11.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg dig vi tale det, vi vide, og vidne
      det, vi have set; og I modtage ikke vort Vidnesbyrd.
 12.  Når jeg siger eder de jordiske Ting, og I ikke tro, hvorledes
      skulle I da tro, når jeg siger eder de himmelske?
 13.  Og ingen er faren op til Himmelen, uden han, som for ned fra
      Himmelen, Menneskesønnen, som er i Himmelen.
 14.  Og ligesom Moses ophøjede Slangen i Ørkenen, således bør
      Menneskesønnen ophøjes,
 15.  for at hver den, som tror, skal have et evigt Liv i ham.
 16.  Thi således elskede Gud Verden, at han gav sin Søn den enbårne,
      for at hver den, som tror på ham, ikke skal fortabes, men have
      et evigt Liv.
 17.  Thi Gud sendte ikke sin Søn til Verden, for at han skal dømme
      Verden, men for at Verden skal frelses ved ham.
 18.  Den, som tror på ham, dømmes ikke; men den, som ikke tror, er
      allerede dømt, fordi han ikke har troet på Guds enbårne Søns
      Navn.
 19.  Og dette er Dommen, at Lyset er kommet til Verden, og Menneskene
      elskede Mørket mere end Lyset; thi deres Gerninger vare onde.
 20.  Thi hver den, som øver ondt, hader Lyset og kommer ikke til
      Lyset, for at hans Gerninger ikke skulle revses.
 21.  Men den, som gør Sandheden, kommer til Lyset, for at hans
      Gerninger må blive åbenbare; thi de ere gjorte i Gud."

 22.  Derefter kom Jesus og hans Disciple ud i Judæas Land, og han
      opholdt sig der med dem og døbte.
 23.  Men også Johannes døbte i Ænon, nær ved Salem, fordi der var
      meget Vand der; og man kom derhen og lod sig døbe.
 24.  Thi Johannes var endnu ikke kastet i Fængsel.
 25.  Da opkom der en Strid imellem Johannes's Disciple og en Jøde om
      Renselse.
 26.  Og de kom til Johannes og sagde til ham: "Rabbi! han, som var
      hos dig hinsides Jordan, han, hvem du gav Vidnesbyrd, se, han
      døber, og alle komme til ham."
 27.  Johannes svarede og sagde: "Et Menneske kan slet intet tage,
      uden det er ham givet fra Himmelen.
 28.  I ere selv mine Vidner på, at jeg sagde: Jeg er ikke Kristus,
      men jeg er udsendt foran ham.
 29.  Den, som har Bruden, er Brudgom; men Brudgommens Ven, som står
      og hører på ham, glæder sig meget over Brudgommens Røst. Så er
      da denne min Glæde bleven fuldkommen.
 30.  Han bør vokse, men jeg forringes.
 31.  Den, som kommer ovenfra, er over alle; den, som er af Jorden, er
      af Jorden og taler af Jorden; den, som kommer fra Himmelen, er
      over alle.
 32.  Og det, som han har set og hørt, vidner han; og ingen modtager
      hans Vidnesbyrd.
 33.  Den, som har modtaget hans Vidnesbyrd, har beseglet, at Gud er
      sanddru.
 34.  Thi han, hvem Gud udsendte, taler Guds Ord; Gud giver nemlig
      ikke Ånden efter Mål.
 35.  Faderen elsker Sønnen og har givet alle Ting i hans Hånd.
 36.  Den, som tror på Sønnen, har et evigt Liv; men den, som ikke vil
      tro Sønnen, skal ikke se Livet, men Guds Vrede bliver over ham."

Johannes 4

  1.  Da Herren nu erfarede, at Farisæerne havde hørt, at Jesus vandt
      flere Disciple og døbte flere end Johannes
  2.  (skønt Jesus ikke døbte selv, men hans Disciple):
  3.  da forlod han Judæa og drog atter bort til Galilæa.
  4.  Men han måtte rejse igennem Samaria.
  5.  Han kommer da til en By i Samaria, som kaldes Sykar, nær ved det
      Stykke Land, som Jakob gav sin Søn Josef.
  6.  Og der var Jakobs Brønd. Jesus satte sig da, træt af Rejsen, ned
      ved Brønden; det var ved den sjette Time.
  7.  En samaritansk Kvinde kommer for at drage Vand op. Jesus siger
      til hende: "Giv mig noget at drikke!"
  8.  Hans Disciple vare nemlig gåede bort til Byen for at købe Mad.
  9.  Da siger den samaritanske Kvinde til ham: "Hvorledes kan dog du,
      som er en Jøde, bede mig, som er en samaritansk Kvinde, om noget
      at drikke?" Thi Jøder holde ikke Samkvem med Samaritanere.
 10.  Jesus svarede og sagde til hende: "Dersom du kendte Guds Gave,
      og hvem det er, som siger til dig: Giv mig noget at drikke, da
      bad du ham, og han gav dig levende Vand."
 11.  Kvinden siger til ham: "Herre! du har jo intet at drage op med,
      og Brønden er dyb; hvorfra har du da det levende Vand?
 12.  Mon du er større end vor Fader Jakob, som har givet os Brønden,
      og han har selv drukket deraf og hans Børn og hans Kvæg?"
 13.  Jesus svarede og sagde til hende: "Hver den, som drikker af
      dette Vand, skal tørste igen.
 14.  Men den, som drikker af det Vand, som jeg giver ham, skal til
      evig Tid ikke tørste; men det Vand, som jeg giver ham, skal
      blive i ham en Kilde af Vand, som fremvælder til et evigt Liv."
 15.  Kvinden siger til ham: "Herre! giv mig dette Vand, for at jeg
      ikke skal tørste og ikke komme hid for at drage op."
 16.  Jesus siger til hende: "Gå bort, kald på din Mand, og kom hid!"
 17.  Kvinden svarede og sagde: "Jeg har ingen Mand." Jesus siger til
      hende: "Med Rette sagde du: Jeg har ingen Mand.
 18.  Thi du har haft fem Mænd; og han, som du nu har, er ikke din
      Mand.  Det har du sagt sandt."
 19.  Kvinden siger til ham: "Herre! jeg ser, at du er en Profet.
 20.  Vore Fædre have tilbedt på dette Bjerg, og I sige, at i
      Jerusalem er Stedet, hvor man bør tilbede."
 21.  Jesus siger til hende: "Tro mig, Kvinde, at den Time kommer, da
      det hverken skal være på dette Bjerg eller i Jerusalem, at I
      tilbede Faderen.
 22.  I tilbede det, I ikke kende; vi tilbede det, vi kende; thi
      Frelsen kommer fra Jøderne.
 23.  Men den Time kommer, ja, den er nu, da de sande Tilbedere skulle
      tilbede Faderen i Ånd og Sandhed; thi det er sådanne Tilbedere,
      Faderen vil have.
 24.  Gud er Ånd, og de, som tilbede ham, bør tilbede i Ånd og
      Sandhed."
 25.  Kvinden siger til ham: "Jeg ved, at Messias kommer (hvilket
      betyder Kristus); når han kommer, skal han kundgøre os alle
      Ting."
 26.  Jesus siger til hende: "Det er mig, jeg, som taler med dig."
 27.  Og i det samme kom hans Disciple, og de undrede sig over, at han
      talte med en Kvinde; dog sagde ingen: "Hvad søger du?" eller:
      "Hvorfor taler du med hende?"
 28.  Da lod Kvinden sin Vandkrukke stå og gik bort til Byen og siger
      til Menneskene der:
 29.  "Kommer og ser en Mand, som har sagt mig alt det, jeg har gjort;
      mon han skulde være Kristus?"
 30.  De gik ud af Byen og kom gående til ham.
 31.  Imidlertid bade Disciplene ham og sagde: "Rabbi, spis!"
 32.  Men han sagde til dem, jeg har Mad at spise, som I ikke kende."
 33.  Da sagde Disciplene til hverandre: "Mon nogen har bragt ham
      noget at spise?"
 34.  Jesus siger til dem: "Min Mad er, at jeg gør hans Villie, som
      udsendte mig, og fuldbyrder hans Gerning.
 35.  Sige I ikke: Der er endnu fire Måneder, så kommer Høsten? Se,
      jeg siger eder, opløfter eders Øjne og ser Markene; de ere
      allerede hvide til Høsten.
 36.  Den, som høster, får Løn og samler Frugt til et evigt Liv, så at
      de kunne glæde sig tilsammen, både den, som sår, og den, som
      høster.
 37.  Thi her er det Ord sandt: En sår, og en anden høster.
 38.  Jeg har udsendt eder at høste det, som I ikke have arbejdet på;
      andre have arbejdet, og I ere gåede ind i deres Arbejde."
 39.  Men mange af Samaritanerne fra den By troede på ham på Grund af
      Kvindens Ord, da hun vidnede: "Han har sagt mig alt det, jeg har
      gjort."
 40.  Da nu Samaritanerne kom til ham, bade de ham om at blive hos
      dem; og han blev der to Dage.
 41.  Og mange flere troede for hans Ords Skyld.
 42.  Og til Kvinden sagde de: "Vi tro nu ikke længer for din Tales
      Skyld; thi vi have selv hørt, og vi vide, at denne er sandelig
      Verdens Frelser."

 43.  Men efter de to Dage gik han derfra til Galilæa.
 44.  Thi Jesus vidnede selv, at en Profet ikke bliver æret i sit eget
      Fædreland.
 45.  Da han nu kom til Galilæa, toge Galilæerne imod ham, fordi de
      havde set alt det, som han gjorde i Jerusalem på Højtiden; thi
      også de vare komne til Højtiden.
 46.  Han kom da atter til Kana i Galilæa, hvor han havde gjort Vandet
      til Vin. Og der var en kongelig Embedsmand, hvis Søn lå syg i
      Kapernaum.
 47.  Da denne hørte, at Jesus var kommen fra Judæa til Galilæa, gik
      han til ham og bad om, at han vilde komme ned og helbrede hans
      Søn; thi han var Døden nær.
 48.  Da sagde Jesus til ham: "Dersom I ikke se Tegn og
      Undergerninger, ville I ikke tro."
 49.  Embedsmanden siger til ham: "Herre! kom, før mit Barn dør."
 50.  Jesus siger til ham: "Gå bort, din Søn lever." Og Manden troede
      det Ord, som Jesus sagde til ham, og gik bort.
 51.  Men allerede medens han var på Hjemvejen, mødte hans Tjenere ham
      og meldte, at hans Barn levede.
 52.  Da udspurgte han dem om den Time, i hvilken det var blevet bedre
      med ham; og de sagde til ham: "I Går ved den syvende time forlod
      Feberen ham."
 53.  Da skønnede Faderen, at det var sket i den Time, da Jesus sagde
      til ham: "Din Søn lever;" og han troede selv og hele hans Hus.
 54.  Dette var det andet Tegn, som Jesus gjorde, da han var kommen
      fra Judæa til Galilæa.

Johannes 5

  1.  Derefter var det Jødernes Højtid, og Jesus gik op til Jerusalem.
  2.  Men der er i Jerusalem ved Fåreporten en Dam, som på Hebraisk
      kaldes Bethesda, og den har fem Søjlegange.
  3.  I dem lå der en Mængde syge, blinde, lamme, visne, (som ventede
      på, at Vandet skulde røres.
  4.  Thi på visse Tider for en Engel ned i Dammen og oprørte Vandet.
      Den, som da, efter at Vandet var blevet oprørt, steg først ned,
      blev rask, hvilken Sygdom han end led af.)
  5.  Men der var en Mand, som havde været syg i otte og tredive År.
  6.  Da Jesus så ham ligge der og vidste, at han allerede havde
      ligget i lang Tid, sagde han til ham: "Vil du blive rask?"
  7.  Den syge svarede ham: "Herre! jeg har ingen, som kan bringe mig
      ned i Dammen, når Vandet bliver oprørt; men når jeg kommer,
      stiger en anden ned før mig."
  8.  Jesus siger til ham: "Stå op, tag din Seng og gå!"
  9.  Og straks blev Manden rask, og han tog sin Seng og gik. Men det
      var Sabbat på den Dag;
 10.  derfor sagde Jøderne til ham, som var bleven helbredt: "Det er
      Sabbat; og det er dig ikke tilladt af bære Sengen."
 11.  Han svarede dem: "Den, som gjorde mig rask, han sagde til mig:
      Tag din Seng og gå!"
 12.  Da spurgte de ham: "Hvem er det Menneske, som sagde til dig: Tag
      din Seng og gå?"
 13.  Men han; som var bleven helbredt, vidste ikke, hvem det var; thi
      Jesus havde unddraget sig, da der var mange Mennesker på Stedet.
 14.  Derefter finder Jesus ham i Helligdommen, og han sagde til ham:
      "Se, du er bleven rask; synd ikke mere, for at ikke noget værre
      skal times dig,!"
 15.  Manden gik bort og sagde til Jøderne, at det var Jesus, som
      havde gjort ham rask.
 16.  Og derfor forfulgte Jøderne Jesus, fordi han havde gjort dette
      på en Sabbat.
 17.  Men Jesus svarede dem: "Min Fader arbejder indtil nu; også jeg
      arbejder."
 18.  Derfor tragtede da Jøderne end mere efter at slå ham ihjel,
      fordi han ikke alene brød Sabbaten, men også kaldte Gud sin egen
      Fader og gjorde sig selv Gud lig.

 19.  Så svarede Jesus og sagde til dem: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger
      jeg eder, Sønnen kan slet intet gøre af sig selv, uden hvad han
      ser Faderen gøre; thi hvad han gør, det gør også Sønnen ligeså.
 20.  Thi Faderen elsker Sønnen og viser ham alt det, han selv gør, og
      han skal vise ham større Gerninger end disse, for at I skulle
      undre eder.
 21.  Thi ligesom Faderen oprejser de døde og gør levende, således gør
      også Sønnen levende, hvem han vil.
 22.  Thi heller ikke dømmer Faderen nogen, men har givet Sønnen hele
      Dommen,
 23.  for at alle skulle ære Sønnen, ligesom de ære Faderen. Den, som
      ikke ærer Sønnen, ærer ikke Faderen, som udsendte ham.
 24.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, den, som hører mit Ord og
      tror den, som sendte mig, har et evigt Liv og kommer ikke til
      Dom, men er gået over fra Døden til Livet.
 25.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, den Time kommer, ja den er
      nu, da de døde skulle høre Guds Søns Røst, og de, som høre den,
      skulle leve.
 26.  Thi ligesom Faderen har Liv i sig selv, således har han også
      givet Sønnen at have Liv i sig selv.
 27.  Og han har givet ham Magt til at holde Dom, efterdi han er
      Menneskesøn.
 28.  Undrer eder ikke herover; thi den Time kommer, på hvilken alle
      de, som ere i Gravene, skulle høre hans Røst,
 29.  og de skulle gå frem, de, som have gjort det gode, til Livets
      Opstandelse, men de, som have gjort det onde, til Dommens
      Opstandelse.
 30.  Jeg kan slet intet gøre af mig selv; således som jeg hører,
      dømmer jeg, og min Dom er retfærdig; thi jeg søger ikke min
      Villie, men hans Villie, som sendte mig.

 31.  Dersom jeg vidner om mig selv, er mit Vidnesbyrd ikke sandt".
 32.  Det er en anden, som vidner om mig, og jeg ved, at det
      Vidnesbyrd er sandt, som han vidner om mig.
 33.  I have sendt Bud til Johannes, og han har vidnet for sandheden.
 34.  Dog, jeg henter ikke Vidnesbyrdet fra et Menneske; men dette
      siger jeg, for at I skulle frelses.
 35.  Han var det brændende og skinnende Lys, og I have til en Tid
      villet fryde eder ved hans Lys.
 36.  Men det Vidnesbyrd, som jeg har, er større end Johannes's; thi
      de Gerninger, som Faderen har givet mig at fuldbyrde, selve de
      Gerninger, som jeg gør, vidne om mig, at Faderen har udsendt
      mig.
 37.  Og Faderen, som sendte mig, han har vidnet om mig. I have aldrig
      hverken hørt hans Røst eller set hans skikkelse,
 38.  og hans Ord have I ikke blivende i eder; thi den, som han
      udsendte, ham tro I ikke.
 39.  I ransage Skrifterne, fordi I mene i dem at have evigt Liv; og
      det er dem, som vidne om mig.
 40.  Og I ville ikke komme til mig, for at I kunne have Liv.
 41.  Jeg tager ikke Ære af Mennesker;
 42.  men jeg kender eder, at I have ikke Guds Kærlighed i eder.
 43.  Jeg er kommen i min Faders Navn, og I modtage mig ikke; dersom
      en anden kommer i sit eget Navn, ham ville I modtage.
 44.  Hvorledes kunne I tro,I, som tage Ære af hverandre, og den Ære,
      som er fra den eneste Gud, søge I ikke?
 45.  Tænker ikke, at jeg vil anklage eder for Faderen; der er en, som
      anklager eder, Moses, til hvem I have sat eders Håb.
 46.  Thi dersom I troede Moses. troede I mig; thi han har skrevet om
      mig,
 47.  Men tro I ikke hans Skrifter, hvorledes skulle I da tro mine
      Ord?"

Johannes 6

  1.  Derefter drog Jesus over til hin Side af Galilæas Sø,Tiberias
      Søen.
  2.  Og en stor Skare fulgte ham, fordi de så de Tegn, som han gjorde
      på de syge.
  3.  Men Jesus gik op på Bjerget og satte sig der med sine Disciple.
  4.  Men Påsken, Jødernes Højtid, var nær.
  5.  Da Jesus nu opløftede sine Øjne og så, at en stor Skare kom til
      ham, sagde han til Filip: "Hvor skulle vi købe Brød, for at
      disse kunne få noget at spise?"
  6.  Men dette sagde han for at prøve ham; thi han vidste selv, hvad
      han vilde gøre.
  7.  Filip svarede ham: "Brød for to Hundrede Denarer er ikke nok for
      dem, til at hver kan få noget lidet."
  8.  En af hans Disciple, Andreas, Simon Peters Broder, siger til
      ham:
  9.  "Her er en lille Dreng, som har fem Bygbrød og to Småfisk; men
      hvad er dette til så mange?"
 10.  Jesus sagde: "Lader Folkene sætte sig ned;" og der var meget
      Græs på Stedet. Da satte Mændene sig ned, omtrent fem Tusinde i
      Tallet.
 11.  Så tog Jesus Brødene og takkede og uddelte dem til dem, som
      havde sat sig ned; ligeledes også af Småfiskene så meget, de
      vilde.
 12.  Men da de vare blevne mætte, siger han til sine Disciple:
      "Samler de tiloversblevne Stykker sammen, for at intet skal gå
      til Spilde."
 13.  Da samlede de og fyldte tolv Kurve med Stykker, som bleve
      tilovers af de fem Bygbrød fra dem, som havde fået Mad.
 14.  Da nu Folkene så det Tegn, som han havde gjort, sagde de: "Denne
      er i Sandhed Profeten, som kommer til Verden."
 15.  Da Jesus nu skønnede, at de vilde komme og tage ham med Magt for
      at gøre ham til Konge, gik han atter op på Bjerget, ganske
      alene.

 16.  Men da det var blevet Aften, gik hans Disciple ned til Søen.
 17.  Og de gik om Bord i et Skib og vilde sætte over til hin Side af
      Søen til Kapernaum. Og det var allerede blevet mørkt, og Jesus
      var endnu ikke kommen til dem.
 18.  Og Søen rejste sig, da der blæste en stærk Vind.
 19.  Da de nu havde roet omtrent fem og tyve eller tredive Stadier,
      se de Jesus vandre på Søen og komme nær til Skibet, og de
      forfærdedes.
 20.  Men han siger til dem: "Det er mig; frygter ikke!"
 21.  Da vilde de tage ham op i Skibet; og straks kom Skibet til
      Landet, som de sejlede til.

 22.  Den næste dag så Skaren, som stod på hin Side af Søen, at der
      ikke havde været mere end eet Skib der, og at Jesus ikke var
      gået om Bord med sine Disciple, men at hans Disciple vare dragne
      bort alene,
 23.  (men der var kommet Skibe fra Tiberias nær til det Sted, hvor de
      spiste Brødet, efter at Herren havde gjort Taksigelse):
 24.  da Skaren nu så, at Jesus ikke var der, ej heller hans Disciple,
      gik de om Bord i Skibene og kom til Kapernaum for at søge efter
      Jesus.
 25.  Og da de fandt ham på hin Side af Søen, sagde de til ham:
      "Rabbi!  når er du kommen hid?"
 26.  Jesus svarede dem og sagde: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder,
      I søge mig, ikke fordi I så Tegn, men fordi I spiste af Brødene
      og bleve mætte.
 27.  Arbejder ikke for den Mad, som er forgængelig, men for den Mad,
      som varer til et evigt Liv, hvilken Menneskesønnen vil give
      eder; thi ham har Faderen, Gud selv, beseglet."
 28.  Da sagde de til ham: "Hvad skulle vi gøre, for at vi kunne
      arbejde på Guds Gerninger?"
 29.  Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Dette er Guds Gerning, at I tro
      på den, som han udsendte."
 30.  Da sagde de til ham: "Hvad gør du da for et Tegn, for at vi
      kunne se det og tro dig? Hvad Arbejde gør du?
 31.  Vore Fædre åde Manna i Ørkenen, som der er skrevet: Han gav dem
      Brød fra Himmelen at æde."
 32.  Da sagde Jesus til dem: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder,
      ikke Moses har givet eder Brødet fra Himmelen, men min Fader
      giver eder det sande Brød fra Himmelen.
 33.  Thi Guds Brød er det, som kommer ned fra Himmelen og giver
      Verden Liv."
 34.  Da sagde de til ham: "Herre! giv os altid dette Brød!"
 35.  Jesus sagde til dem: "Jeg er Livets Brød. Den, som kommer til
      mig, skal ikke hungre; og den, som tror på mig, skal aldrig
      tørste.
 36.  Men jeg har sagt eder, at I have set mig og dog ikke tro.
 37.  Alt, hvad Faderen giver mig, skal komme til mig; og den, som
      kommer til mig, vil jeg ingenlunde kaste ud.
 38.  Thi jeg er kommen ned fra Himmelen, ikke for at gøre min Villie,
      men hans Villie, som sendte mig.
 39.  Men dette er hans Villie, som sendte mig, at jeg skal intet
      miste af alt det, som han har givet mig, men jeg skal oprejse
      det på den yderste Dag.
 40.  Thi dette er min Faders Villie, at hver den, som ser Sønnen og
      tror på ham, skal have et evigt Liv, og jeg skal oprejse ham på
      den yderste Dag."
 41.  Da knurrede Jøderne over ham, fordi han sagde: "Jeg er det Brød,
      som kom ned fra Himmelen,"
 42.  og de sagde: "Er dette ikke Jesus, Josefs Søn, hvis Fader og
      Moder vi kende? Hvorledes kan han da sige: Jeg er kommen ned fra
      Himmelen?"
 43.  Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Knurrer ikke indbyrdes!
 44.  Ingen kan komme til mig, uden Faderen, som sendte mig, drager
      ham; og jeg skal oprejse ham på den yderste Dag.
 45.  Der er skrevet hos Profeterne: "Og de skulle alle være oplærte
      af Gud." Hver den, som har hørt af Faderen og lært, kommer til
      mig.
 46.  Ikke at nogen har set Faderen, kun den, som er fra Gud, han har
      set Faderen.
 47.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, den, som tror på mig, har et
      evigt Liv.
 48.  Jeg er Livets Brød.
 49.  Eders Fædre åde Manna i Ørkenen og døde.
 50.  Dette er det Brød, som kommer ned fra Himmelen, at man skal æde
      af det og ikke dø.
 51.  Jeg er det levende Brød, som kom ned fra Himmelen; om nogen æder
      af dette Brød, han skal leve til evig Tid; og det Brød, som jeg
      vil give, er mit Kød, hvilket jeg vil give for Verdens Liv."
 52.  Da kivedes Jøderne indbyrdes og sagde: "Hvorledes kan han give
      os sit Kød at æde?"
 53.  Jesus sagde da til dem: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder,
      dersom I ikke æde Menneskesønnens Kød og drikke hans Blod, have
      I ikke Liv i eder.
 54.  Den, som æder mit Kød og drikker mit Blod, har et evigt Liv, og
      jeg skal oprejse ham på den yderste Dag.
 55.  Thi mit Kød er sand Mad, og mit Blod er sand Drikke.
 56.  Den, som æder mit Kød og drikker mit Blod, han bliver i mig, og
      jeg i ham.
 57.  Ligesom den levende Fader udsendte mig, og jeg lever i Kraft af
      Faderen, ligeså skal også den, som æder mig, leve i Kraft af
      mig.
 58.  dette er det Brød, som er kommet ned fra Himmelen; ikke som
      eders Fædre åde og døde. Den, som æder dette Brød, skal leve
      evindelig."
 59.  Dette sagde han, da han lærte i en Synagoge i Kapernaum.

 60.  Da sagde mange af hans Disciple, som havde hørt ham: "Dette er
      en hård Tale; hvem kan høre den?"
 61.  Men da Jesus vidste hos sig selv, at hans Disciple knurrede
      derover, sagde han til dem: "Forarger dette eder?
 62.  Hvad om I da få at se, at Menneskesønnen farer op, hvor han var
      før?
 63.  Det er Ånden, som levendegør, Kødet gavner intet; de Ord, som
      jeg har talt til eder, ere Ånd og ere Liv.
 64.  Men der er nogle af eder, som ikke tro." Thi Jesus vidste fra
      Begyndelsen, hvem det var, der ikke troede, og hvem den var, der
      skulde forråde ham.
 65.  Og han sagde: "Derfor har jeg sagt eder, at ingen kan komme til
      mig, uden det er givet ham af Faderen."
 66.  Fra den Tid trådte mange af hans Disciple tilbage og vandrede
      ikke mere med ham.
 67.  Jesus sagde da til de tolv: "Mon også I ville gå bort?"
 68.  Simon Peter svarede ham: "Herre! til hvem skulle vi gå hen? Du
      har det evige Livs Ord;
 69.  og vi have troet og erkendt, at du er Guds Hellige."
 70.  Jesus svarede dem: "Har jeg ikke udvalgt mig eder tolv, og en af
      eder er en Djævel?"
 71.  Men han talte om Judas, Simon Iskariots Søn; thi det var ham,
      som siden skulde forråde ham, skønt han var en af de tolv.

Johannes 7

  1.  Derefter vandrede Jesus omkring i Galilæa; thi han vilde ikke
      vandre i Judæa, fordi Jøderne søgte at slå ham ihjel.
  2.  Men Jødernes Højtid, Løvsalsfesten, var nær.
  3.  Da sagde hans Brødre til ham: "Drag bort herfra og gå til Judæa,
      for at også dine Disciple kunne se dine Gerninger, som du gør.
  4.  Thi ingen gør noget i Løndom, når han selv ønsker at være
      åbenbar; dersom du gør dette, da vis dig for Verden!"
  5.  Thi heller ikke hans Brødre troede på ham.
  6.  Da siger Jesus til dem: "Min Tid er endnu ikke kommen; men eders
      Tid er stedse for Hånden.
  7.  Verden kan ikke hade eder; men mig hader den, fordi jeg vidner
      om den, at dens Gerninger ere onde.
  8.  Drager I op til Højtiden; jeg drager endnu ikke op til denne
      Højtid, thi min Tid er endnu ikke fuldkommet."
  9.  Da han havde sagt dette til dem, blev han i Galilæa.
 10.  Men da hans Brødre vare dragne op til Højtiden, da drog han også
      selv op, ikke åbenlyst, men lønligt.

 11.  Da ledte Jøderne efter ham på Højtiden og sagde: "Hvor er han?"
 12.  Og der blev mumlet meget om ham iblandt Skarerne; nogle sagde:
      "Han er en god Mand;" men andre sagde: "Nej, han forfører
      Mængden."
 13.  Dog talte ingen frit om ham af Frygt for Jøderne.

 14.  Men da det allerede var midt i Højtiden. gik Jesus op i
      Helligdommen og lærte.
 15.  Jøderne undrede sig nu og sagde: "Hvorledes kan denne have
      Lærdom, da han ikke er oplært?"
 16.  Da svarede Jesus dem og sagde: "Min Lære er ikke min, men hans,
      som sendte mig.
 17.  Dersom nogen vil gøre hans Villie, skal han erkende, om Læren er
      fra Gud, eller jeg taler af mig selv.
 18.  Den, der taler af sig selv, søger sin egen Ære; men den, som
      søger hans Ære, der sendte ham, han er sanddru, og der er ikke
      Uret i ham.
 19.  Har ikke Moses givet eder Loven? Og ingen af eder holder Loven.
      Hvorfor søge I at slå mig ihjel?"
 20.  Mængden svarede: "Du er besat; hvem søger at slå dig ihjel?"
 21.  Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Een Gerning gjorde jeg, og I
      undre eder alle derover.
 22.  Moses har givet eder Omskærelsen, (ikke at den er fra Moses, men
      fra Fædrene) og I omskære et Menneske på en Sabbat.
 23.  Dersom et Menneske får Omskærelse på en Sabbat, for at Mose Lov
      ikke skal brydes, ere I da vrede på mig, fordi jeg har gjort et
      helt Menneske rask på en Sabbat?
 24.  Dømmer ikke efter Skinnet, men dømmer en retfærdig Dom!"

 25.  Da sagde nogle af dem fra Jerusalem: "Er det ikke ham, som de
      søge at slå ihjel?
 26.  Og se, han taler frit, og de sige intet til ham; mon
      Rådsherrerne virkelig skulde have erkendt, at han er Kristus?
 27.  Dog vi vide, hvorfra denne er; men når Kristus kommer, kender
      ingen, hvorfra han er."
 28.  Derfor råbte Jesus, idet han lærte i Helligdommen, og sagde:
      "Både kende I mig og vide, hvorfra jeg er! Og af mig selv er jeg
      ikke kommen, men han, som sendte mig, er sand, han, hvem I ikke
      kende.
 29.  Jeg kender ham; thi jeg er fra ham, og han har udsendt mig."
 30.  De søgte da at gribe ham; og ingen lagde Hånd på ham, thi hans
      Time var endnu ikke kommen.
 31.  Men mange af Folket troede på ham, og de sagde: "Når Kristus
      kommer, mon han da skal gøre flere Tegn, end denne har gjort?"

 32.  Farisæerne hørte, at Mængden mumlede dette om ham; og
      Ypperstepræsterne og Farisæerne sendte Tjenere ud for at gribe
      ham.
 33.  Da sagde Jesus: "Endnu en liden Tid er jeg hos eder, så går jeg
      bort til den, som sendte mig.
 34.  I skulle lede efter mig og ikke finde mig, og der, hvor jeg er,
      kunne I ikke komme."
 35.  Da sagde Jøderne til hverandre: "Hvor vil han gå hen, siden vi
      ikke skulle finde ham? Mon han vil gå til dem, som ere adspredte
      iblandt Grækerne, og lære Grækerne?
 36.  Hvad er det for et Ord, han siger: I skulle lede efter mig og
      ikke finde mig, og der, hvor jeg er, kunne I ikke komme?"
 37.  Men på den sidste, den store Højtidsdag stod Jesus og råbte og
      sagde: "Om nogen tørster,han komme til mig og drikke!
 38.  Den, som tror på mig, af hans Liv skal der, som Skriften har
      sagt, flyde levende Vandstrømme:"
 39.  Men dette sagde han om den Ånd, som de, der troede på ham,
      skulde få; thi den Helligånd var der ikke endnu, fordi Jesus
      endnu ikke var herliggjort.

 40.  Nogle af Mængden, som hørte disse Ord, sagde nu: "Dette er
      sandelig Profeten."
 41.  Andre sagde: "Dette er Kristus;" men andre sagde: "Mon da
      Kristus kommer fra Galilæa?
 42.  Har ikke Skriften sagt, at Kristus kommer af Davids Sæd og fra
      Bethlehem, den Landsby, hvor David var?"
 43.  Således blev der Splid iblandt Mængden om ham.
 44.  Men nogle af dem vilde gribe ham; dog lagde ingen Hånd på ham.

 45.  Tjenerne kom nu til Ypperstepræsterne og Farisæerne, og disse
      sagde til dem: "Hvorfor have I ikke ført ham herhen?"
 46.  Tjenerne svarede: "Aldrig har noget Menneske talt således som
      dette Menneske."
 47.  Da svarede Farisæerne dem: "Ere også I forførte?
 48.  Mon nogen af Rådsherrerne har troet på ham, eller nogen af
      Farisæerne?
 49.  Men denne Hob, som ikke kender Loven, er forbandet."
 50.  Nikodemus, han, som var kommen til ham om Natten og var en af
      dem, sagde til dem:
 51.  "Mon vor Lov dømmer et Menneske, uden at man først forhører ham
      og får at vide, hvad han gør?"
 52.  De svarede og sagde til ham: "Er også du fra Galilæa? Ransag og
      se, at der ikke fremstår nogen Profet fra Galilæa."

Johannes 8

  1.  Og de gik hver til sit Hus. Men Jesus gik til Oliebjerget.
  2.  og årle om Morgenen kom han igen i Helligdommen, og hele Folket
      kom til ham; og han satte sig og lærte dem.
  3.  Men de skriftkloge og Farisæerne føre en Kvinde til ham, greben
      i Hor, og stille hende frem i Midten.
  4.  Og de sige til ham: "Mester! denne Kvinde er greben i Hor på
      fersk Gerning.
  5.  Men Moses bød os i Loven, at sådanne skulle stenes; hvad siger
      nu du?"
  6.  Men dette sagde de for at friste ham, for at de kunde have noget
      at anklage ham for. Men Jesus bøjede sig ned og skrev med
      Fingeren på Jorden.
  7.  Men da de bleve ved at spørge ham, rettede han sig op og sagde
      til dem: "Den iblandt eder, som er uden Synd, kaste først Stenen
      på hende!"
  8.  Og han bøjede sig atter ned og skrev på Jorden.
  9.  Men da de hørte det, gik de bort, den ene efter den anden, fra
      de ældste til de yngste, og Jesus blev alene tilbage med
      Kvinden, som stod der i Midten.
 10.  Men da Jesus rettede sig op og ingen så uden Kvinden, sagde han
      til hende: "Kvinde! hvor ere de henne? Var der ingen, som
      fordømte dig?,"
 11.  Men hun sagde: "Herre! ingen." Da sagde Jesus: "Heller ikke jeg
      fordømmer dig; gå bort, og synd ikke mere!"

 12.  Jesus talte da atter til dem og sagde: "Jeg er Verdens Lys; den,
      som følger mig, skal ikke vandre i Mørket, men have Livets Lys."
 13.  Da sagde Farisæerne til ham: "Du vidner om dig selv; dit
      Vidnesbyrd er ikke sandt."
 14.  Jesus svarede og sagde til dem: "Om jeg end vidner om mig
      selv. er mit Vidnesbyrd sandt; thi jeg ved, hvorfra jeg kom, og
      hvor jeg går hen; men I vide ikke, hvorfra jeg kommer, og hvor
      jeg går hen.
 15.  I dømme efter Kødet; jeg dømmer ingen.
 16.  Men om jeg også dømmer, er min Dom sand; thi det er ikke mig
      alene, men mig og Faderen, han, som sendte mig.
 17.  Men også i eders Lov er der skrevet, at to Menneskers Vidnesbyrd
      er sandt.
 18.  Jeg er den, der vidner om mig selv, og Faderen, som sendte mig,
      vidner om mig."
 19.  Derfor sagde de til ham: "Hvor er din Fader?" Jesus svarede: "I
      kende hverken mig eller min Fader; dersom I kendte mig, kendte I
      også min Fader."
 20.  Disse Ord talte Jesus ved Tempelblokken, da han lærte i
      Helligdommen; og ingen greb ham, fordi hans Time endnu ikke var
      kommen.
 21.  Da sagde han atter til dem: "Jeg går bort, og I skulle lede
      efter mig, og I skulle dø i eders Synd; hvor jeg går hen, kunne
      I ikke komme."
 22.  Da sagde Jøderne: "Mon han vil slå sig selv ihjel, siden han
      siger: Hvor jeg går hen, kunne I ikke komme?"
 23.  Og han sagde til dem: "I ere nedenfra, jeg er ovenfra; I ere af
      denne Verden, jeg er ikke af denne Verden.
 24.  Derfor har jeg sagt eder, at I skulle dø i eders Synder; thi
      dersom I ikke tro, at det er mig, skulle I dø i eders Synder."
 25.  De sagde da til ham: "Hvem er du?" Og Jesus sagde til dem: "Just
      det, som jeg siger eder.
 26.  Jeg har meget at tale og dømme om eder; men den, som sendte mig,
      er sanddru, og hvad jeg har hørt af ham, det taler jeg til
      Verden."
 27.  De forstode ikke, at han talte til dem om Faderen.
 28.  Da sagde Jesus til dem: "Når I få ophøjet Menneskesønnen, da
      skulle I kende, at det er mig, og at jeg gør intet af mig selv;
      men som min Fader har lært mig, således taler jeg.
 29.  Og han, som sendte mig, er med mig; han har ikke ladet mig
      alene, fordi jeg; gør altid det, som er ham til Behag."

 30.  Da han talte dette, troede mange på ham.
 31.  Jesus sagde da til de Jøder, som vare komne til Tro på ham:
      "Dersom I blive i mit Ord, ere I sandelig mine Disciple,
 32.  og I skulle erkende Sandheden, og Sandheden skal frigøre eder."
 33.  De svarede ham: "Vi ere Abrahams Sæd og have aldrig været nogens
      Trælle; hvorledes siger du da: I skulle vorde frie?"
 34.  Jesus svarede dem: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, hver
      den, som gør Synden, er Syndens Træl.
 35.  Men Trællen bliver ikke i Huset til evig Tid, Sønnen bliver der
      til evig Tid.
 36.  Dersom da Sønnen får frigjort eder, skulle I være virkelig frie.
 37.  Jeg ved, at I ere Abrahams Sæd; men I søge at slå mig ihjel,
      fordi min Tale ikke finder Rum hos eder.
 38.  Jeg taler det, som jeg har set hos min Fader; så gøre også I
      det, som I have hørt af eders Fader."
 39.  De svarede og sagde til ham: "Vor Fader er Abraham." Jesus sagde
      til dem: "Dersom I vare Abrahams Børn, gjorde I Abrahams
      Gerninger.
 40.  Men nu søge I at slå mig ihjel, et Menneske, der har sagt eder
      Sandheden, som jeg har hørt af Gud; dette gjorde Abraham ikke.
 41.  I gøre eders Faders Gerninger." De sagde til ham: "Vi ere ikke
      avlede i Hor; vi have een Fader, Gud."
 42.  Jesus sagde til dem: "Dersom Gud var eders Fader, da elskede I
      mig; thi jeg er udgået og kommen fra Gud; thi jeg er heller ikke
      kommen af mig selv, men han har udsendt mig.
 43.  Hvorfor forstå I ikke min Tale? fordi I ikke kunne høre mit Ord.
 44.  I ere af den Fader Djævelen, og eders Faders Begæringer ville I
      gøre. Han var en Manddraber fra Begyndelsen af, og han står ikke
      i Sandheden; thi Sandhed er ikke i ham. Når han taler Løgn,
      taler han af sit eget; thi han er en Løgner og Løgnens Fader.
 45.  Men mig tro I ikke, fordi jeg siger Sandheden.
 46.  Hvem af eder kan overbevise mig om nogen Synd? Siger jeg
      Sandhed, hvorfor tro I mig da ikke?
 47.  Den, som er af Gud, hører Guds Ord; derfor høre I ikke, fordi I
      ere ikke af Gud."
 48.  Jøderne svarede og sagde til ham: "Sige vi ikke med Rette, at du
      er en Samaritan og er besat?"
 49.  Jesus svarede: "Jeg er ikke besat, men jeg ærer min Fader, og I
      vanære mig.
 50.  Men jeg søger ikke min Ære; der er den, som søger den og dømmer.
 51.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, dersom nogen holder mit Ord,
      skal han i al Evighed ikke se Døden."
 52.  Jøderne sagde til ham: "Nu vide vi, at du et besat; Abraham døde
      og Profeterne, og du siger: Dersom nogen holder mit Ord, han
      skal i al Evighed ikke smage Døden.
 53.  Mon du er større end vor Fader Abraham, som jo døde? også
      Profeterne døde; hvem gør du dig selv til?"
 54.  Jesus svarede: "Dersom jeg ærer mig selv, er min Ære intet; det
      er min Fader, som ærer mig, han, om hvem I sige, at han er eders
      Gud.
 55.  Og I have ikke kendt ham, men jeg kender ham. Og dersom jeg
      siger: "Jeg kender ham ikke," da bliver jeg en Løgner ligesom I;
      men jeg kender ham og holder hans Ord.
 56.  Abraham, eders Fader, frydede sig til at se min Dag, og han så
      den og glædede sig."
 57.  Da sagde Jøderne til ham: "Du er endnu ikke halvtredsindstyve År
      gammel, og du har set Abraham?"
 58.  Jesus sagde til dem: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, førend
      Abraham blev til, har jeg været."
 59.  Så toge de Sten for at kaste på ham; men Jesus skjulte sig og
      gik ud af Helligdommen.

Johannes 9

  1.  Og da han gik forbi så han et Menneske, som var blindt fra
      Fødselen.
  2.  Og hans Disciple spurgte ham og sagde: "Rabbi, hvem har syndet,
      denne eller hans Forældre, så han skulde fødes blind?"
  3.  Jesus svarede: "Hverken han eller hans Forældre have syndet; men
      det er sket, for at Guds Gerninger skulle åbenbares på ham.
  4.  Jeg må gøre hans Gerninger, som sendte mig, så længe det er Dag;
      der kommer en Nat, da ingen kan arbejde.
  5.  Medens jeg er i Verden, er jeg Verdens Lys."
  6.  Da han havde sagt dette, spyttede han på Jorden og gjorde Dynd
      af Spyttet og smurte Dyndet på hans Øjne.
  7.  Og han sagde til ham: "Gå hen, to dig i Dammen Siloam" (hvilket
      er udlagt: udsendt). Da gik han bort og toede sig, og han kom
      seende tilbage.
  8.  Da sagde Naboerne og de, som før vare vante til at se ham som
      Tigger: "Er det ikke ham, som sad og tiggede?"
  9.  Nogle sagde: "Det er ham;" men andre sagde: "Nej, han ligner
      ham."  Han selv sagde: "Det er mig."
 10.  Da sagde de til ham: "Hvorledes bleve dine Øjne åbnede?"
 11.  Han svarede: "En Mand, som kaldes Jesus, gjorde Dynd og smurte
      det på mine Øjne og sagde til mig: Gå hen til Siloam og to dig!
      Da jeg så gik hen og toede mig, blev jeg seende."
 12.  Da sagde de til ham: "Hvor er han?" Han siger: "Det ved jeg
      ikke."
 13.  De føre ham, som før var blind, til Farisæerne.
 14.  Men det var Sabbat den Dag, da Jesus gjorde Dyndet og åbnede
      hans Øjne.
 15.  Atter spurgte nu også Farisæerne ham, hvorledes han var bleven
      seende. Men han sagde til dem: "Han lagde Dynd på mine Øjne, og
      jeg toede mig, og nu ser jeg."
 16.  Nogle af Farisæerne sagde da: "Dette Menneske er ikke fra Gud,
      efterdi han ikke holder Sabbaten." Andre sagde: "Hvorledes kan
      et syndigt Menneske gøre sådanne Tegn?" Og der var Splid imellem
      dem.
 17.  de sige da atter til den blinde: "Hvad siger du om ham, efterdi
      han åbnede dine Øjne?" Men han sagde: "Han er en Profet."
 18.  Så troede Jøderne ikke om ham, at han havde været blind og var
      bleven seende, førend de fik kaldt på Forældrene til ham, som
      havde fået sit Syn.
 19.  Og de spurgte dem og sagde: "Er denne eders Søn, om hvem I sige,
      at han var født blind? Hvorledes er han da nu seende?"
 20.  Hans Forældre svarede dem og sagde; "Vi vide, at denne er vor
      Søn, og at han, var født blind.
 21.  Men hvorledes han nu er bleven seende, vide vi ikke, og hvem der
      har åbnet hans Øjne, vide vi ikke heller; spørger ham; han er
      gammel nok; han må selv tale for sig."
 22.  Dette sagde hans Forældre, fordi de frygtede for Jøderne; thi
      Jøderne vare allerede komne overens om, at dersom nogen bekendte
      ham som Kristus, skulde han udelukkes af Synagogen.
 23.  Derfor sagde hans Forældre: "Han er gammel nok, spørger ham
      selv!"
 24.  Da hidkaldte de anden Gang Manden, som havde været blind, og
      sagde til ham: "Giv Gud Æren; vi vide, at dette Menneske er en
      Synder."
 25.  Da svarede han: "Om han er en Synder, ved jeg ikke; een Ting ved
      jeg, at jeg, som var blind, nu ser."
 26.  De sagde da til ham igen: "Hvad gjorde han ved dig? Hvorledes
      åbnede han dine Øjne?"
 27.  Han svarede dem: "Jeg har allerede sagt eder det, og I hørte
      ikke efter. Hvorfor ville I høre det igen? Ville også I blive
      hans Disciple?"
 28.  Da udskældte de ham og sagde: "Du er hans Discipel; men vi ere
      Mose Disciple.
 29.  Vi vide, at Gud har talt til Moses; men om denne vide vi ikke.
      hvorfra han er."
 30.  Manden svarede og sagde til dem: "Det er dog underligt, at I
      ikke vide, hvorfra han er, og han har åbnet mine Øjne.
 31.  Vi vide, at Syndere bønhører Gud ikke; men dersom nogen er
      gudfrygtig og gør hans Villie, ham hører han.
 32.  Aldrig er det hørt, at nogen har åbnet Øjnene på en blindfødt.
 33.  Var denne ikke fra Gud, da kunde han intet gøre."
 34.  De svarede og sagde til ham: "Du er hel og holden født i Synder,
      og du vil lære os?" Og de stødte ham ud.
 35.  Jesus hørte, at de havde udstødt ham; og da han traf ham sagde
      han til ham: "Tror du på Guds Søn?"
 36.  Han svarede og sagde: "Hvem er han, Herre? for at jeg kan tro på
      ham."
 37.  Jesus sagde til ham: "Både har du set ham, og den, som taler med
      dig, ham er det."
 38.  Men han sagde: "Jeg tror Herre!" og han kastede sig ned for ham.
 39.  Og Jesus sagde: "Til Dom er jeg kommen til denne Verden, for at
      de, som ikke se, skulle blive seende, og de, som se, skulle
      blive blinde."
 40.  Nogle af Farisæerne, som vare hos. ham, hørte dette, og de sagde
      til ham: "Mon også vi ere blinde?"
 41.  Jesus sagde til dem: "Vare I blinde, da havde I ikke Synd; men
      nu sige I: Vi se; eders Synd forbliver."

Johannes 10

  1.  " Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, den, som ikke går ind i
      Fårefolden gennem Døren, men stiger andensteds over, han er en
      Tyv og en Røver.
  2.  Men den, som går ind igennem Døren, er Fårenes Hyrde.
  3.  For ham lukker Dørvogteren op, og Fårene høre hans Røst; og han
      kalder sine egne Får ved Navn og fører dem ud.
  4.  Og når han har ført alle sine egne Får ud, går han foran dem; og
      Fårene følge ham, fordi de kende hans Røst.
  5.  Men en fremmed ville de ikke følge, men de ville fly fra ham,
      fordi de ikke kende de fremmedes Røst."
  6.  Denne Lignelse sagde Jesus til dem; men de forstode ikke, hvad
      det var, som han talte til dem.
  7.  Jesus sagde da atter til dem: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg
      eder, jeg er Fårenes Dør.
  8.  Alle de, som ere komne før mig, ere Tyve og Røvere; men Fårene
      hørte dem ikke.
  9.  Jeg er Døren; dersom nogen går ind igennem mig, han skal
      frelses; og han skal gå ind og gå ud og finde Føde.
 10.  Tyven kommer ikke uden for at stjæle og slagte og ødelægge; jeg
      er kommen, for at de skulle have Liv og have Overflod.
 11.  Jeg er den gode Hyrde; den gode Hyrde sætter sit Liv til for
      Fårene.
 12.  Men Lejesvenden, som ikke er Hyrde, hvem Fårene ikke høre til
      ser Ulven komme og forlader Fårene og flyr, og Ulven røver dem
      og adspreder dem,
 13.  fordi han er en Lejesvend og ikke bryder sig om Fårene.
 14.  Jeg er den gode Hyrde, og jeg kender mine, og mine kende mig,
 15.  ligesom Faderen kender mig, og jeg kender Faderen; og jeg sætter
      mit Liv til for Fårene.
 16.  Og jeg har andre Får, som ikke høre til denne Fold; også dem bør
      jeg føre, og de skulle høre min Røst; og der skal blive een
      Hjord, een Hyrde.
 17.  Derfor elsker Faderen mig, fordi jeg sætter mit Liv til for at
      tage det igen.
 18.  Ingen tager det fra mig, men jeg sætter det til af mig selv. Jeg
      har Magt til at sætte det til, og jeg har Magt til at tage det
      igen.  Dette Bud modtog jeg af min Fader."
 19.  Der blev atter Splid iblandt Jøderne for disse Ords Skyld.
 20.  Og mange af dem sagde: "Han er besat og raser, hvorfor høre I
      ham?"
 21.  Andre sagde: "Dette er ikke Ord af en besat; mon en ond Ånd kan
      åbne blindes Øjne?"

 22.  Men Tempelvielsens Fest indtraf i Jerusalem. Det var Vinter;
 23.  og Jesus gik omkring i Helligdommen, i Salomons Søjlegang.
 24.  Da omringede Jøderne ham og sagde til ham: "Hvor længe holder du
      vor Sjæl i Uvished? Dersom du er Kristus, da sig os det rent
      ud!"
 25.  Jesus svarede dem: "Jeg har sagt eder det, og I tro ikke. De
      Gerninger, som jeg gør i min Faders Navn, de vidne om mig;
 26.  men I tro ikke, fordi I ikke ere af mine Får.
 27.  Mine Får høre min Røst, og jeg kender dem, og de følge mig,
 28.  og jeg giver dem et evigt Liv, og de skulle i al Evighed ikke
      fortabes, og ingen skal rive dem ud af min Hånd.
 29.  Min Fader, som har givet mig dem, er større end alle; og ingen
      kan rive noget af min Faders Hånd.
 30.  Jeg og Faderen, vi ere eet."
 31.  Da toge Jøderne atter Sten op for at stene ham.
 32.  Jesus svarede dem: "Mange gode Gerninger har jeg vist eder fra
      min Fader; for hvilken af disse Gerninger stene I mig?"
 33.  Jøderne svarede ham: "For en god Gerning stene vi dig ikke, men
      for Gudsbespottelse, og fordi du, som er et Menneske, gør dig
      selv til Gud."
 34.  Jesus svarede dem: "Er der ikke skrevet i eders Lov: Jeg har
      sagt: I ere Guder?
 35.  Når den nu har kaldt dem Guder, til hvem Guds Ord kom (og
      Skriften kan ikke rokkes),
 36.  sige I da til den, hvem Faderen har Helliget og sendt til
      Verden: Du taler bespotteligt, fordi jeg sagde: Jeg er Guds Søn?
 37.  Dersom jeg ikke gør min Faders Gerninger, så tror mig ikke!
 38.  Men dersom jeg gør dem, så tror Gerningerne, om I end ikke ville
      tro mig, for at I kunne indse og erkende, at Faderen er i mig,
      og jeg i Faderen."
 39.  De søgte da atter at gribe ham; og han undslap af deres Hånd.

 40.  Og han drog atter bort hinsides Jordan til det Sted, hvor
      Johannes først døbte, og han blev der.
 41.  Og mange kom til ham, og de sagde: "Johannes gjorde vel intet
      Tegn; men alt, hvad Johannes sagde om denne, var sandt."
 42.  Og mange troede på ham der.

Johannes 11

  1.  Men der lå en Mand syg, Lazarus fra Bethania, den Landsby, hvor
      Maria og hendes Søster Martha boede.
  2.  Men Maria var den, som salvede Herren med Salve og tørrede hans
      Fødder med sit Hår; hendes Broder Lazarus var syg.
  3.  Da sendte Søstrene Bud til ham og lod sige: "Herre! se, den, du
      elsker, er syg."
  4.  Men da Jesus hørte dette, sagde han: "Denne Sygdom er ikke til
      Døden, men for Guds Herligheds Skyld, for at Guds Søn skal
      herliggøres ved den."
  5.  Men Jesus elskede Martha og hendes Søster og Lazarus.
  6.  Da han nu hørte, at han var syg, blev han dog to Dage på det
      Sted, hvor han var.
  7.  Derefter siger han så til Disciplene:"Lader os gå til Judæa
      igen!
  8.  Disciplene sige til ham: "Rabbi! nylig søgte Jøderne at stene
      dig, og du drager atter derhen?"
  9.  Jesus svarede: "Har Dagen ikke tolv Timer? Vandrer nogen om
      Dagen, da støder han ikke an; thi han ser denne Verdens Lys.
 10.  Men vandrer nogen om Natten, da støder han an; thi Lyset er ikke
      i ham."
 11.  Dette sagde han, og derefter siger han til dem: "Lazarus, vor
      Ven, er sovet ind; men jeg går hen for at vække ham af Søvne."
 12.  Da sagde Disciplene til ham: "Herre! sover han, da bliver han
      helbredt."
 13.  Men Jesus havde talt om hans Død; de derimod mente, at han talte
      om Søvnens Hvile.
 14.  Derfor sagde da Jesus dem rent ud: "Lazarus er død!
 15.  Og for eders Skyld er jeg glad over, at jeg ikke var der, for at
      I skulle tro; men lader os gå til ham!"
 16.  Da sagde Thomas (hvilket betyder Tvilling), til sine
      Meddisciple: "Lader os også gå, for at vi kunne dø med ham!"
 17.  Da Jesus nu kom, fandt han, at han havde ligget i Graven
      allerede fire Dage.
 18.  Men Bethania var nær ved Jerusalem, omtrent femten Stadier
      derfra.
 19.  Og mange af Jøderne vare komne til Martha og Maria for at trøste
      dem over deres Broder.
 20.  Da Martha nu hørte, at Jesus kom, gik hun ham i Møde; men Maria
      blev siddende i Huset.
 21.  Da sagde Martha til Jesus: "Herre! havde du været her, da var
      min Broder ikke død.
 22.  Men også nu ved jeg, at hvad som helst du beder Gud om, vil Gud
      give dig."
 23.  Jesus siger til hende: "Din Broder skal opstå."
 24.  Martha siger til ham: "Jeg ved at han skal opstå i Opstandelsen
      på den yderste Dag."
 25.  Jesus sagde til hende: "Jeg er Opstandelsen og Livet; den, som
      tror på mig, skal leve, om han end dør.
 26.  Og hver den, som lever og tror på mig, skal i al Evighed ikke
      dø.  Tror du dette?"
 27.  Hun siger til ham: "Ja, Herre! jeg tror, at du er Kristus, Guds
      Søn, den, som kommer til Verden."
 28.  Og da hun havde sagt dette, gik hun bort og kaldte hemmeligt sin
      Søster Maria og sagde: "Mesteren er her og kalder ad dig."
 29.  Da hun hørte det, rejste hun sig hastigt og gik til ham.
 30.  Men Jesus var endnu ikke kommen til Landsbyen, men var på det
      Sted, hvor Martha havde mødt ham.
 31.  Da nu Jøderne, som vare hos hende i Huset og trøstede hende, så,
      at Maria stod hastigt op og gik ud, fulgte de hende, idet de
      mente, at hun gik ud til Graven for at græde der.
 32.  Da Maria nu kom derhen, hvor Jesus var, og så ham, faldt hun ned
      for hans Fødder og sagde til ham: "Herre! havde du været her da
      var min Broder ikke død."
 33.  Da nu Jesus så hende græde og så Jøderne, som vare komne med
      hende, græde, harmedes han i Ånden og blev heftig bevæget i sit
      Indre; og han sagde:
 34.  "Hvor have I lagt ham?" De sige til ham: "Herre! kom og se!"
 35.  Jesus græd.
 36.  Da sagde Jøderne: "Se, hvor han elskede ham!"
 37.  Men nogle af dem sagde: "Kunde ikke han, som åbnede den blindes
      Øjne, have gjort, at også denne ikke var død?"
 38.  Da harmes Jesus atter i sit Indre og går hen til Graven. Men det
      var en Hule, og en Sten lå for den.
 39.  Jesus siger: "Tager Stenen bort!" Martha, den dødes Søster,
      siger til ham: "Herre! han stinker allerede; thi han har ligget
      der fire Dage:"
 40.  Jesus siger til hende: " Sagde jeg ikke, at dersom du tror, skal
      du se Guds Herlighed?"
 41.  Da toge de Stenen bort. Men Jesus opløftede sine Øjne og sagde:
      "Fader! jeg takker dig, fordi du har hørt mig.
 42.  Jeg vidste vel, at du altid hører mig; men for Skarens Skyld,
      som står omkring, sagde jeg det, for at de skulle tro, at du har
      udsendt mig."
 43.  Og da han havde sagt dette, råbte han med høj Røst: "Lazarus,
      kom herud!"
 44.  Og den døde kom ud, bunden med Jordeklæder om Fødder og Hænder,
      og et Tørklæde var bundet om hans Ansigt, Jesus siger til dem:
      "Løser ham, og lader ham gå!"

 45.  Mange af de Jøder, som vare komne til Maria og havde set, hvad
      han havde gjort, troede nu på ham;
 46.  men nogle af dem gik hen til Farisæerne og sagde dem, hvad
      Jesus, havde gjort.
 47.  Ypperstepræsterne og Farisæerne sammenkaldte da et Møde af Rådet
      og sagde: "Hvad gøre vi? thi dette Menneske gør mange Tegn.
 48.  Dersom vi lade ham således blive ved, ville alle tro på ham, og
      Romerne ville komme og tage både vort Land og Folk."
 49.  Men en af dem, Kajfas, som var Ypperstepræst i det År, sagde til
      dem:
 50.  "I vide intet; ej heller betænke I, at det er os gavnligt, at
      eet Menneske dør for Folket, og at ikke det hele Folk skal gå
      til Grunde."
 51.  Men dette sagde han ikke af sig selv; men da han var
      Ypperstepræst i det År, profeterede han at Jesus skulde dø for
      Folket;
 52.  og ikke for Folket alene, men for at han også kunde samle Guds
      adspredte Børn sammen til eet.
 53.  Fra den Dag af rådsloge de derfor om at ihjelslå ham.

 54.  Derfor vandrede Jesus ikke mere frit om iblandt jøderne, men gik
      bort derfra ud på Landet, nær ved Ørkenen, til en By, som kaldes
      Efraim; og han blev der med sine Disciple.
 55.  Men Jødernes Påske var nær; og mange fra Landet gik op til
      Jerusalem før Påsken for at rense sig.
 56.  Da ledte de efter Jesus og sagde mellem hverandre, da de stode i
      Helligdommen: "Hvad mene I? Mon han ikke kommer til Højtiden?"
 57.  Men Ypperstepræsterne og Farisæerne havde givet Befaling om at
      dersom nogen vidste, hvor han var, skulde han give det til Kende
      for at de kunde gribe ham.

Johannes 12

  1.  Seks Dage før Påske kom Jesus nu til Bethania, hvor Lazarus
      boede, han, som Jesus havde oprejst fra de døde.
  2.  Der gjorde de da et Aftensmåltid for ham, og Martha vartede op;
      men Lazarus var en af dem, som sade til Bords med ham.
  3.  Da tog Maria et Pund af ægte, såre kostbar Nardussalve og
      salvede Jesu Fødder og tørrede hans Fødder med sit Hår; og Huset
      blev fuldt af Salvens Duft.
  4.  Da siger en af hans Disciple, Judas, Simons Søn, Iskariot, han,
      som siden forrådte ham:
  5.  "Hvorfor blev denne Salve ikke solgt for tre Hundrede Denarer og
      given til fattige?"
  6.  Men dette sagde han, ikke fordi han brød sig om de fattige, men
      fordi han var en Tyv og havde Pungen og bar, hvad der blev lagt
      deri.
  7.  Da sagde Jesus: "Lad hende med Fred, hun har jo bevaret den til
      min Begravelsesdag!
  8.  De fattige have I jo altid hos eder; men mig have I ikke altid."
  9.  En stor Skare af Jøderne fik nu at vide, at han var der; og de
      kom ikke for Jesu Skyld alene, men også for at se Lazarus, hvem
      han havde oprejst fra de døde.
 10.  Men Ypperstepræsterne rådsloge om også at slå Lazarus ihjel:
 11.  thi for hans Skyld gik mange af Jøderne hen og troede på Jesus.

 12.  Den følgende Dag, da den store Skare, som var kommen til
      Højtiden, hørte, at Jesus kom til Jerusalem,
 13.  toge de Palmegrene og gik ud imod ham og råbte: "Hosanna!
      velsignet være den, som kommer, i Herrens Navn, Israels Konge!"
 14.  Men Jesus fandt et ungt Æsel og satte sig derpå, som der er
      skrevet:
 15.  "Frygt ikke, Zions Datter! se, din Konge kommer, siddende på en
      Asenindes Føl."
 16.  Dette forstode hans Disciple ikke først; men da Jesus var
      herliggjort, da kom de i Hu, at dette var skrevet om ham, og at
      de havde gjort dette for ham.
 17.  Skaren, som var med ham, vidnede nu, at han havde kaldt Lazarus
      frem fra Graven og oprejst ham fra de døde.
 18.  Det var også derfor, at Skaren gik ham i Møde, fordi de havde
      hørt, at han havde gjort dette Tegn.
 19.  Da sagde Farisæerne til hverandre: "I se, at I udrette ikke
      noget; se, Alverden går efter ham."

 20.  Men der var nogle Grækere af dem, som plejede at gå op for at
      tilbede på Højtiden.
 21.  Disse gik nu til Filip, som var fra Bethsajda i Galilæa, og bade
      ham og sagde: "Herre! vi ønske at se Jesus."
 22.  Filip kommer og siger det til Andreas, Andreas og Filip komme og
      sige det til Jesus.
 23.  Men Jesus svarede dem og sagde: "Timen er kommen, til at
      Menneskesønnen skal herliggøres.
 24.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, hvis ikke Hvedekornet falder
      i Jorden og dør, bliver det ene; men dersom det dør, bærer det
      megen Frugt.
 25.  Den, som elsker sit Liv, skal miste det; og den, som hader sit
      Liv i denne Verden, skal bevare det til et evigt Liv.
 26.  Om nogen tjener mig, han følge mig, og hvor jeg er, der skal
      også min Tjener være; om nogen tjener mig, ham skal Faderen ære.
 27.  Nu er min Sjæl forfærdet; og hvad skal jeg sige? Fader, frels
      mig fra denne Time? Dog, derfor er jeg kommen til denne Time.
 28.  Fader herliggør dit Navn!" Da kom der en Røst fra Himmelen:
      "Både har jeg herliggjort det, og vil jeg atter herliggøre det."
 29.  Da sagde Skaren, som stod og hørte det, at det havde tordnet;
      andre sagde: "En Engel har talt til ham."
 30.  Jesus svarede og sagde: "Ikke for min Skyld er denne Røst
      kommen, men for eders Skyld.
 31.  Nu går der Dom over denne Verden, nu skal denne Verdens Fyrste
      kastes ud,
 32.  og jeg skal, når jeg bliver ophøjet fra Jorden, drage alle til
      mig."
 33.  Men dette sagde han for at betegne, hvilken Død han skulde dø.
 34.  Skaren svarede ham: "Vi have hørt af Loven, at Kristus bliver
      evindelig, og hvorledes siger da du, at Menneskesønnen bør
      ophøjes?  Hvem er denne Menneskesøn?"
 35.  Da sagde Jesus til dem: "Endnu en liden Tid er Lyset hos eder.
      Vandrer, medens I have Lyset, for at Mørke ikke skal overfalde
      eder!  Og den, som vandrer i Mørket, ved ikke, hvor han går hen.
 36.  Medens I have Lyset, tror på Lyset, for at I kunne blive Lysets
      Børn!" Dette talte Jesus, og han gik bort og blev skjult for
      dem.

 37.  Men endskønt han havde gjort så mange Tegn for deres Øjne,
      troede de dog ikke på ham,
 38.  for at Profeten Esajas's Ord skulde opfyldes, som han har sagt:
      "Herre! hvem troede det, han hørte af os, og for hvem blev
      Herrens Arm åbenbaret?"
 39.  Derfor kunde de ikke tro, fordi Esajas har atter sagt:
 40.  "Han har blindet deres Øjne og forhærdet deres Hjerte, for at de
      ikke skulle se med Øjnene og forstå med Hjertet og omvende sig,
      så jeg kunde helbrede dem."
 41.  Dette sagde Esajas, fordi han så hans Herlighed og talte om ham.
 42.  Alligevel var der dog mange, endogså af Rådsherrerne, som troede
      på ham; men for Farisæernes Skyld bekendte de det ikke, for at
      de ikke skulde blive udelukkede af Synagogen;
 43.  thi de elskede Menneskenes Ære mere end Guds Ære.
 44.  Men Jesus råbte og sagde: "Den, som tror på mig, tror ikke på
      mig, men på ham, som sendte mig,
 45.  og den, som ser mig, ser den, som sendte mig.
 46.  Jeg er kommen som et Lys til Verden, for at hver den, som tror
      på mig, ikke skal blive i Mørket.
 47.  Og om nogen hører mine Ord og ikke vogter på dem, ham dømmer
      ikke jeg; thi jeg er ikke kommen for at dømme Verden, men for at
      frelse Verden.
 48.  Den, som foragter mig og ikke modtager mine Ord, har den, som
      dømmer ham; det Ord, som jeg har talt, det skal dømme ham på den
      yderste Dag.
 49.  Thi jeg har ikke talt af mig selv; men Faderen, som sendte mig,
      han har givet mig Befaling om, hvad jeg skal sige, og hvad jeg
      skal tale.
 50.  Og jeg ved, at hans Befaling er evigt Liv. Altså, hvad jeg
      taler, taler jeg således, som Faderen har sagt mig."

Johannes 13

  1.  Men før Påskehøjtiden, da Jesus vidste, at hans Time var kommen,
      til at han skulde gå bort fra denne Verden til Faderen, da,
      ligesom han havde elsket sine egne, som vare i Verden, så
      elskede han dem indtil Enden.
  2.  Og medens der holdtes Aftensmåltid, da Djævelen allerede havde
      indskudt i Judas's, Simons Søns, Iskariots Hjerte, at han skulde
      forråde ham;
  3.  da Jesus vidste, at Faderen havde givet ham alle Ting i Hænde,
      og at han var udgået fra Gud og gik hen til Gud:
  4.  så rejser han sig fra Måltidet og lægger sine Klæder fra sig, og
      han tog et Linklæde og bandt det om sig.
  5.  Derefter hælder han Vand i Vaskefadet og begyndte at to
      Disciplenes Fødder og at tørre dem med Linklædet, som han var
      ombunden med.
  6.  Han kommer da til Simon Peter; og denne siger til ham: "Herre!
      tor du mine Fødder?"
  7.  Jesus svarede og sagde til ham: "Hvad jeg gør, ved du ikke nu,
      men du skal forstå det siden efter."
  8.  Peter siger til ham: "Du skal i al Evighed ikke to mine Fødder."
      Jesus svarede ham: "Dersom jeg ikke tor dig, har du ikke Lod
      sammen med mig."
  9.  Simon Peter siger til ham: "Herre! ikke mine Fødder alene, men
      også Hænderne og Hovedet."
 10.  Jesus siger til ham: "Den, som er tvættet, har ikke nødig at to
      andet end Fødderne, men er ren over det hele; og I ere rene, men
      ikke alle."
 11.  Thi han kendte den, som forrådte ham; derfor sagde han: "I ere
      ikke alle rene."
 12.  Da han nu havde toet deres Fødder og havde taget sine Klæder og
      atter sat sig til Bords, sagde han til dem: "Vide I, hvad jeg
      har gjort ved eder?
 13.  I kalde mig Mester og Herre, og I tale ret, thi jeg er det.
 14.  Når da jeg, Herren og Mesteren, har toet eders Fødder, så ere
      også I skyldige at to hverandres Fødder.
 15.  Thi jeg har givet eder et Eksempel, for at, ligesom jeg gjorde
      ved eder, skulle også I gøre.
 16.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, en Tjener er ikke større end
      sin Herre, ikke heller et Sendebud større end den, som har sendt
      ham.
 17.  Når I vide dette, ere I salige, om I gøre det.
 18.  Jeg taler ikke om eder alle; jeg ved, hvilke jeg har udvalgt;
      men Skriften måtte opfyldes: Den, som æder Brødet med mig, har
      opløftet sin Hæl imod mig.
 19.  Fra nu af siger jeg eder det, førend det sker, for at I, når det
      er sket, skulle tro, at det er mig.
 20.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, den, som modtager, hvem jeg
      sender, modtager mig; men den, som modtager mig, modtager ham,
      som har sendt mig."

 21.  Da Jesus havde sagt dette, blev han heftigt bevæget i Ånden og
      vidnede og sagde: "Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, en af
      eder vil forråde mig."
 22.  Da så Disciplene på hverandre, tvivlrådige om, hvem han talte
      om.
 23.  Men der var en iblandt hans Disciple, som sad til Bords ved Jesu
      Side, han, hvem Jesus elskede.
 24.  Til denne nikker da Simon Peter og siger til ham: "Sig, hvem det
      er, han taler om?"
 25.  Men denne bøjer sig op til Jesu Bryst og siger til ham: "Herre!
      hvem er det?"
 26.  Jesus svarer: "Det er den, hvem jeg giver det Stykke Brød, som
      jeg dypper." Så dypper han Stykket og tager og giver det til
      Judas, Simons Søn, Iskariot.
 27.  Og efter at han havde fået Stykket, da gik Satan ind i ham. Så
      siger Jesus til ham: "Hvad du gør, gør det snart!"
 28.  Men ingen af dem, som sade til Bords, forstod, hvorfor han sagde
      ham dette.
 29.  Thi nogle mente, efterdi Judas havde Pungen, at Jesus sagde til
      ham: "Køb, hvad vi have nødig til Højtiden;" eller at han skulde
      give noget til de fattige.
 30.  Da han nu havde fået Stykket, gik han straks ud. Men det var
      Nat.

 31.  Da han nu var gået ud, siger Jesus: "Nu er Menneskesønnen
      herliggjort, og Gud er herliggjort i ham.
 32.  Dersom Gud er herliggjort i ham, skal Gud også herliggøre ham i
      sig, og han skal snart herliggøre ham.
 33.  Børnlille! endnu en liden Stund er jeg hos eder. I skulle lede
      efter mig, og ligesom jeg sagde til Jøderne: "Hvor jeg går hen,
      kunne I ikke komme," siger jeg nu også til eder.
 34.  Jeg giver eder en ny Befaling, at I skulle elske hverandre, at
      ligesom jeg elskede eder, skulle også I elske hverandre.
 35.  Derpå skulle alle kende, at I ere mine Disciple, om I have
      indbyrdes Kærlighed."

 36.  Simon Peter siger til ham: "Herre! hvor går du hen?" Jesus
      svarede ham: "Hvor jeg går hen, kan du ikke nu følge mig, men
      siden skal du følge mig."
 37.  Peter siger til ham: "Herre! hvorfor kan jeg ikke følge dig nu?
      Jeg vil sætte mit Liv til for dig?
 38.  Jesus svarer: "Vil du sætte dit Liv til for mig? Sandelig,
      sandelig, siger jeg dig, Hanen skal ikke gale, førend du har
      fornægtet mig tre Gange."

Johannes 14

  1.  "Eders Hjerte forfærdes ikke! Tror på Gud, og tror på mig!
  2.  I min Faders Hus er der mange Boliger. Dersom det ikke var så,
      havde jeg sagt eder det; thi jeg går bort for at berede eder
      Sted.
  3.  Og når jeg er gået bort og har beredt eder Sted, kommer jeg igen
      og tager eder til mig, for at, hvor jeg er, der skulle også I
      være.
  4.  Og hvor jeg går hen, derhen vide I Vejen."
  5.  Thomas siger til ham: "Herre! vi vide ikke, hvor du går hen; og
      hvorledes kunne vi vide Vejen?"
  6.  Jesus siger til ham: "Jeg er Vejen og Sandheden og Livet; der
      kommer ingen til Faderen uden ved mig.
  7.  Havde I kendt mig, da havde I også kendt min Fader; og fra nu af
      kende I ham og have set ham."
  8.  Filip siger til ham: "Herre! vis os Faderen, og det er os nok."
  9.  Jesus siger til ham: "Så lang en Tid har jeg været hos eder, og
      du kender mig ikke, Filip? Den, som har set mig, har set
      Faderen; hvorledes kan du da sige: Vis os Faderen?
 10.  Tror du ikke, at jeg er i Faderen, og Faderen er i mig? De Ord,
      som jeg siger til eder, taler jeg ikke af mig selv; men Faderen,
      som bliver i mig, han gør sine Gerninger.
 11.  Tror mig, at jeg er i Faderen, og Faderen er i mig; men ville I
      ikke, så tror mig dog for selve Gerningernes Skyld!

 12.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, den, som tror på mig, de
      Gerninger, som jeg gør, skal også han gøre, og han skal gøre
      større Gerninger end disse; thi jeg går til Faderen,
 13.  og hvad som helst I bede om i mit Navn, det vil jeg gøre, for at
      Faderen må herliggøres ved Sønnen.
 14.  Dersom I bede om noget i mit Navn, vil jeg gøre det.
 15.  Dersom I elske mig, da holder mine Befalinger!
 16.  Og jeg vil bede Faderen, og han skal give eder en anden Talsmand
      til at være hos eder evindelig,
 17.  den Sandhedens Ånd, som Verden ikke kan modtage, thi den ser den
      ikke og kender den ikke; men I kende den, thi den bliver hos
      eder og skal være i eder.
 18.  Jeg vil ikke efterlade eder faderløse; jeg kommer til eder.
 19.  Endnu en liden Stund, og Verden ser mig ikke mere, men I se mig;
      thi jeg lever, og I skulle leve.
 20.  På den Dag skulle I erkende, at jeg er i min Fader, og I i mig,
      og jeg i eder.
 21.  Den, som har mine Befalinger og holder dem, han er den, som
      elsker mig; men den, som elsker mig, skal elskes af min Fader;
      og jeg skal elske ham og åbenbare mig for ham."
 22.  Judas (ikke Iskariot) siger til ham: "Herre! hvor kommer det, at
      du vil åbenbare dig for os og ikke for verden?"
 23.  Jesus svarede og sagde til ham: "Om nogen elsker mig, vil han
      holde mit Ord; og min Fader skal elske ham, og vi skulle komme
      til ham og tage Bolig hos ham.
 24.  Den, som ikke elsker mig, holder ikke mine Ord; og det Ord, som
      I høre, er ikke mit, men Faderens, som sendte mig.

 25.  Dette har jeg talt til eder, medens jeg blev hos eder.
 26.  Men Talsmanden, den Helligånd, som Faderen vil sende i mit Navn,
      han skal lære eder alle Ting og minde eder om alle Ting, som jeg
      har sagt eder.
 27.  Fred efterlader jeg eder, min Fred giver jeg eder; jeg giver
      eder ikke, som Verden giver. Eders Hjerte forfærdes ikke og
      forsage ikke!
 28.  I have hørt, at jeg sagde til eder: Jeg går bort og kommer til
      eder igen. Dersom I elskede mig, da glædede I eder over, at jeg
      går til Faderen; thi Faderen er større end jeg.
 29.  Og nu har jeg sagt eder det, før det sker, for at I skulle tro,
      når det er sket.
 30.  Jeg skal herefter ikke tale meget med eder; thi denne Verdens
      Fyrste kommer, og han har slet intet i mig;
 31.  men for at verden skal kende, at jeg elsker Faderen og gør
      således, som Faderen har befalet mig: så står nu op, lader os gå
      herfra!"

Johannes 15

  1.  "Jeg er det sande Vintræ, og min Fader er Vingårdsmanden.
  2.  Hver Gren på mig, som ikke bærer Frugt, den borttager han, og
      hver den, som bærer Frugt, renser han, for at den skal bære mere
      Frugt.
  3.  I ere allerede rene på Grund af det Ord, som jeg har talt til
      eder.
  4.  Bliver i mig, da bliver også jeg i eder. Ligesom Grenen ikke kan
      bære Frugt af sig selv, uden den bliver på Vintræet, således
      kunne I ikke heller, uden I blive i mig.
  5.  Jeg er Vintræet, I ere Grenene. Den, som bliver i mig, og jeg i
      ham, han bærer megen Frugt; thi uden mig kunne I slet intet
      gøre.
  6.  Om nogen ikke bliver i mig, han bliver udkastet som en Gren og
      visner; man sanker dem og kaster dem i Ilden, og de brændes.
  7.  Dersom I blive i mig, og mine Ord blive i eder, da beder, om
      hvad som helst I ville, og det skal blive eder til Del.
  8.  Derved er min Fader herliggjort, at I bære megen Frugt, og I
      skulle blive mine Disciple.

  9.  Ligesom Faderen har elsket mig, så har også jeg elsket eder;
      bliver i min Kærlighed!
 10.  Dersom I holde mine Befalinger, skulle I blive i min Kærlighed,
      ligesom jeg har holdt min Faders Befalinger og bliver i hans
      Kærlighed.
 11.  Dette har jeg talt til eder, for at min Glæde kan være i eder,
      og eders Glæde kan blive fuldkommen.
 12.  Dette er min Befaling, at I skulle elske hverandre, ligesom jeg
      har elsket eder.
 13.  Større Kærlighed har ingen end denne, at han sætter sit Liv til
      for sine Venner.
 14.  I ere mine Venner, dersom I gøre, hvad jeg befaler eder.
 15.  Jeg kalder eder ikke længere Tjenere; thi Tjeneren ved ikke,
      hvad hans Herre gør; men eder har jeg kaldt Venner; thi alt det,
      som jeg har hørt af min Fader, har jeg kundgjort eder.
 16.  I have ikke udvalgt mig, men jeg har udvalgt eder og sat eder
      til, at I skulle gå hen og bære Frugt, og eders Frugt skal blive
      ved, for at Faderen skal give eder, hvad som helst I bede ham om
      i mit Navn.
 17.  Dette befaler jeg eder, at I skulle elske hverandre.

 18.  Når Verden hader eder, da vid, at den har hadet mig førend eder.
 19.  Vare I af Verden, da vilde Verden elske sit eget; men fordi I
      ikke ere af Verden, men jeg har valgt eder ud af Verden, derfor
      hader Verden eder.
 20.  Kommer det Ord i Hu, som jeg har sagt eder: En Tjener er ikke
      større end sin Herre. Have de forfulgt mig, ville de også
      forfølge eder; have de holdt mit Ord, ville de også holde eders.
 21.  Men alt dette ville de gøre imod eder for mit Navns Skyld, fordi
      de ikke kende den, som sendte mig.
 22.  Dersom jeg ikke var kommen og havde talt til dem, havde de ikke
      Synd; men nu have de ingen Undskyldning for deres Synd.
 23.  Den, som hader mig, hader også min Fader.
 24.  Havde jeg ikke gjort de Gerninger iblandt dem, som ingen anden
      har gjort, havde de ikke Synd; men nu have de set dem og dog
      hadet både mig og min Fader.
 25.  Dog, det Ord, som er skrevet i deres Lov, må opfyldes: De hadede
      mig uforskyldt.
 26.  Men når Talsmanden kommer, som jeg skal sende eder fra Faderen,
      Sandhedens Ånd, som udgår fra Faderen, da skal han vidne om mig.
 27.  Men også I skulle vidne; thi I vare med mig fra Begyndelsen."

Johannes 16

  1.  "Dette har jeg talt til eder, for at I ikke skulle forarges.
  2.  De skulle udelukke eder af Synagogerne, ja, den Tid skal komme,
      at hver den, som slår eder ihjel, skal mene, at han viser Gud en
      Dyrkelse.
  3.  Og dette skulle de gøre, fordi de hverken kende Faderen eller
      mig.
  4.  Men dette har jeg talt til eder, for at I, når Timen kommer,
      skulle komme i Hu, at jeg har sagt eder det; men dette sagde jeg
      eder ikke fra Begyndelsen, fordi jeg var hos eder.

  5.  Men nu går jeg hen til ham, som sendte mig, og ingen af eder
      spørger mig: Hvor går du hen?
  6.  Men fordi jeg har talt dette til eder, har Bedrøvelsen opfyldt
      eders Hjerte.
  7.  Men jeg siger eder Sandheden: Det er eder gavnligt, at jeg går
      bort, thi går jeg ikke bort, kommer Talsmanden ikke til eder;
      men går jeg bort, så vil jeg sende ham til eder.
  8.  Og når han kommer, skal han overbevise Verden om Synd og om
      Retfærdighed og om Dom.
  9.  Om Synd, fordi de ikke tro på mig;
 10.  men om Retfærdighed, fordi jeg går til min Fader, og I se mig
      ikke længer;
 11.  men om Dom, fordi denne Verdens Fyrste er dømt.
 12.  Jeg har endnu meget at sige eder; men I kunne ikke bære det nu.
 13.  Men når han, Sandhedens Ånd, kommer, skal han vejlede eder til
      hele Sandheden; thi han skal ikke tale af sig selv, men hvad som
      helst han hører, skal han tale, og de kommende Ting skal han
      forkynde eder.
 14.  Han skal herliggøre mig; thi han skal tage af mit og forkynde
      eder.
 15.  Alt, hvad Faderen har, er mit; derfor sagde jeg, at han skal
      tage af mit og forkynde eder.

 16.  Om en liden Stund skulle I ikke se mig længer, og atter om en
      liden Stund skulle I se mig."
 17.  Da sagde nogle af hans Disciple til hverandre: "Hvad er dette,
      som han siger os: Om en liden Stund skulle I ikke se mig, og
      atter om en liden Stund skulle I se mig, og: Jeg går hen til
      Faderen?"
 18.  De sagde altså: "Hvad er dette, han siger: Om en liden Stund?
      Vi forstå ikke, hvad han taler."
 19.  Jesus vidste, at de vilde spørge ham, og han sagde til dem: "I
      spørge hverandre om dette, at jeg sagde: Om en liden Stund
      skulle I ikke se mig, og atter om en liden Stund skulle I se
      mig.
 20.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg eder, I skulle græde og jamre, men
      Verden skal glæde sig; I skulle være bedrøvede, men eders
      Bedrøvelse skal blive til Glæde.
 21.  Når Kvinden føder, har hun Bedrøvelse, fordi hendes Time er
      kommen; men når hun har født Barnet, kommer hun ikke mere sin
      Trængsel i Hu af Glæde over, at et Menneske er født til Verden.
 22.  Også I have da vel nu Bedrøvelse, men jeg skal se eder igen, og
      eders Hjerte skal glædes, og ingen tager eders Glæde fra eder.
 23.  Og på den Dag skulle I ikke spørge mig om noget. Sandelig,
      sandelig, siger jeg eder, hvad som helst I bede Faderen om, skal
      han give eder i mit Navn.
 24.  Hidindtil have I ikke bedt om noget i mit Navn; beder, og I
      skulle få, for at eders Glæde må blive fuldkommen.
 25.  Dette har jeg talt til eder i Lignelser; der kommer en Time, da
      jeg ikke mere skal tale til eder i Lignelser, men frit ud
      forkynde eder om Faderen.
 26.  På den Dag skulle I bede i mit Navn, og jeg siger ikke til eder,
      at jeg vil bede Faderen for eder;
 27.  thi Faderen selv elsker eder, fordi I have elsket mig og troet,
      at jeg er udgået fra Gud.
 28.  Jeg udgik fra Faderen og er kommen til Verden; jeg forlader
      Verden igen og går til Faderen."
 29.  Hans Disciple sige til ham: "Se, nu taler du frit ud og siger
      ingen Lignelse.
 30.  Nu vide vi, at du ved alle Ting og ikke har nødig, at nogen
      spørger dig; desårsag tro vi, at du er udgået fra Gud."
 31.  Jesus svarede dem: "Nu tro I!
 32.  Se, den Time kommer, og den er kommen, da I skulle adspredes
      hver til sit og lade mig alene; dog, jeg er ikke alene, thi
      Faderen er med mig.
 33.  Dette har jeg talt til eder, for at I skulle have Fred i mig. I
      Verden have I Trængsel; men værer frimodige, jeg har overvundet
      Verden."

Johannes 17

  1.  Dette talte Jesus;og han opløftede sine Øjne til Himmelen og
      sagde: "Fader! Timen er kommen; herliggør din Søn, for at Sønnen
      må herliggøre dig,
  2.  ligesom du har givet ham Magt over alt Kød, for at han skal give
      alle dem, som du har givet ham, evigt Liv.
  3.  Men dette er det evige Liv, at de kende dig, den eneste sande
      Gud, og den, du udsendte, Jesus Kristus.
  4.  Jeg har herliggjort dig på Jorden ved at fuldbyrde den Gerning,
      som du har givet mig at gøre.
  5.  Og Fader! herliggør du mig nu hos dig selv med den Herlighed,
      som jeg havde hos dig, før Verden var.

  6.  Jeg har åbenbaret dit Navn for de Mennesker, som du har givet
      mig ud af Verden; de vare dine, og du gav mig dem. og de have
      holdt dit Ord.
  7.  Nu vide de, at alt det, som du har givet mig, er fra dig.
  8.  Thi de Ord, som du har givet mig, har jeg givet dem; og de have
      modtaget dem og erkendt i Sandhed, at jeg udgik fra dig, og de
      have troet, at du har udsendt mig.
  9.  Jeg beder for dem; jeg beder ikke for Verden, men for dem, som
      du har givet mig; thi de ere dine.
 10.  Og alt mit er dit, og dit er mit; og jeg er herliggjort i dem.
 11.  Og jeg er ikke mere i Verden, men disse ere i Verden, og jeg
      kommer til dig. Hellige Fader! bevar dem i dit Navn, hvilket du
      har givet mig, for at de må være et ligesom vi.
 12.  Da jeg var hos dem, bevarede jeg dem i dit Navn, hvilket du har
      givet mig, og jeg vogtede dem, og ingen af dem blev fortabt,
      uden Fortabelsens Søn, for at Skriften skulde opfyldes.
 13.  Men nu kommer jeg til dig, og dette taler jeg i Verden, for at
      de må have min Glæde fuldkommet i sig.
 14.  Jeg har givet dem dit Ord; og Verden har hadet dem, fordi de
      ikke ere af Verden, ligesom jeg ikke er af Verden.
 15.  Jeg beder ikke om, at du vil tage dem ud af Verden, men at du
      vil bevare dem fra det onde.
 16.  De ere ikke af Verden, ligesom jeg ikke er af Verden.
 17.  Hellige dem i Sandheden; dit Ord er Sandhed.
 18.  Ligesom du har udsendt mig til Verden, så har også jeg udsendt
      dem til Verden.
 19.  Og jeg helliger mig selv for dem, for at også de skulle være
      helligede i Sandheden.

 20.  Men jeg beder ikke alene for disse, men også for dem, som ved
      deres Ord tro på mig,
 21.  at de må alle være eet; ligesom du, Fader! i mig, og jeg i dig,
      at også de skulle være eet i os, for at Verden må tro, at du har
      udsendt mig.
 22.  Og den Herlighed, som du har givet mig, har jeg givet dem, for
      at de skulle være eet, ligesom vi ere eet,
 23.  jeg i dem og du i mig, for at de må være fuldkommede til eet,
      for at Verden må erkende, at du har udsendt mig og har elsket
      dem, ligesom du har elsket mig.
 24.  Fader! jeg vil, at, hvor jeg er, skulle også de, som du har
      givet mig, være hos mig, for at de må skue min Herlighed, som du
      har givet mig; thi du har elsket mig før Verdens Grundlæggelse.
 25.  Retfærdige Fader! og Verden har ikke kendt dig, men jeg har
      kendt dig, og disse have kendt, at du har udsendt mig.
 26.  Og jeg har kundgjort dem dit Navn og vil kundgøre dem det, for
      at den Kærlighed, hvormed du har elsket mig, skal være i dem, og
      jeg i dem."

Johannes 18

  1.  Da Jesus havde sagt dette, gik han ud med sine Disciple over
      Kedrons Bæk, hvor der var en Have, i hvilken han gik ind med
      sine Disciple.
  2.  Men også Judas, som forrådte ham, kendte Stedet; thi Jesus
      samledes ofte der med sine Disciple.
  3.  Så tager Judas Vagtafdelingen og Svende fra Ypperstepræsterne og
      Farisæerne og kommer derhen med Fakler og Lamper og Våben.
  4.  Da nu Jesus vidste alt, hvad der skulde komme over ham, gik han
      frem og sagde til dem: "Hvem lede I efter?"
  5.  De svarede ham: "Jesus af Nazareth." Jesus siger til dem: "Det
      er mig." Men også Judas, som forrådte ham, stod hos dem.
  6.  Som han da sagde til dem: "Det er mig," vege de tilbage og faldt
      til Jorden.
  7.  Han spurgte dem nu atter: "Hvem lede I efter?" Men de sagde:
      "Jesus af Nazareth."
  8.  Jesus svarede: "Jeg har sagt eder, at det er mig; dersom I da
      lede efter mig, så lader disse gå!"
  9.  for at det Ord skulde opfyldes, som han havde sagt: "Jeg mistede
      ingen af dem, som du har givet mig."
 10.  Simon Peter, som havde et Sværd, drog det nu og slog
      Ypperstepræstens Tjener og afhuggede hans højre Øre. Men
      Tjeneren hed Malkus.
 11.  Da sagde Jesus til Peter: "Stik dit Sværd i Skeden! Skal jeg
      ikke drikke den Kalk, som min Fader har givet mig?"

 12.  Vagtafdelingen og Krigsøversten og Jødernes Svende grebe da
      Jesus og bandt ham.
 13.  Og de førte ham først til Annas; thi han var Svigerfader til
      Kajfas, som var Ypperstepræst i det År.
 14.  Men det var Kajfas, som havde givet Jøderne det Råd, at det var
      gavnligt, at eet Menneske døde for Folket.
 15.  Men Simon Peter og en anden Discipel fulgte Jesus, og den
      Discipel var kendt med Ypperstepræsten, og han gik ind med Jesus
      i Ypperstepræstens Gård.
 16.  Men Peter stod udenfor ved Døren. Da gik den anden Discipel, som
      var kendt med Ypperstepræsten, ud og sagde det til Dørvogtersken
      og førte Peter ind.
 17.  Pigen, som var Dørvogterske, siger da til Peter: "Er også du af
      dette Menneskes Disciple?" Han siger: "Nej, jeg er ikke."
 18.  Men Tjenerne og Svendene stode og havde gjort en Kulild (thi det
      var koldt) og varmede sig; men også Peter stod hos dem og
      varmede sig.
 19.  Ypperstepræsten spurgte nu Jesus om hans Disciple og om hans
      Lære.
 20.  Jesus svarede ham: "Jeg har talt frit ud til Verden; jeg har
      altid lært i Synagoger og i Helligdommen, der, hvor alle Jøderne
      komme sammen, og i Løndom har jeg intet talt.
 21.  Hvorfor spørger du mig? Spørg dem, som have hørt, hvad jeg talte
      til dem; se, de vide, hvad jeg har sagt."
 22.  Men som han sagde dette, gav en af Svendene, som stode hos,
      Jesus et Slag i Ansigtet og sagde: "Svarer du Ypperstepræsten
      således?"
 23.  Jesus svarede ham: "Har jeg talt ilde, da bevis, at det er ondt:
      men har jeg talt ret, hvorfor slår du mig da?"
 24.  Annas sendte ham nu bunden til Ypperstepræsten Kajfas.
 25.  Men Simon Peter stod og varmede sig. Da sagde de til ham: "Er
      også du af hans Disciple?" Han nægtede det og sagde: "Nej, jeg
      er ikke."
 26.  En af Ypperstepræstens Tjenere, som var en Frænde af ham, hvis
      Øre Peter havde afhugget, siger: "Så jeg dig ikke i Haven med
      ham?"
 27.  Da nægtede Peter det atter, og straks galede Hanen.

 28.  De føre nu Jesus fra Kajfas til Landshøvdingens Borg; men det
      var årle. Og de gik ikke ind i Borgen, for at de ikke skulde
      besmittes, men kunde spise Påske,
 29.  Pilatus gik da ud til dem, og han siger: "Hvad Klagemål føre I
      mod dette Menneske?"
 30.  De svarede og sagde til ham: "Var han ikke en Ugerningsmand, da
      havde vi ikke overgivet ham til dig."
 31.  Da sagde Pilatus til dem: "Tager I ham og dømmer ham efter eders
      Lov!" Da sagde Jøderne til ham: "Det er os ikke tilladt at
      aflive nogen; "
 32.  for at Jesu Ord skulde opfyldes, det, som han sagde, da han gav
      til Kende, hvilken Død han skulde dø.
 33.  Da gik Pilatus igen ind i Borgen og kaldte på Jesus og sagde til
      ham: "Er du Jødernes Konge?"
 34.  Jesus svarede: "Siger du dette af dig selv, eller have andre
      sagt dig det om mig?"
 35.  Pilatus svarede: "Mon jeg er en Jøde? dit Folk og
      Ypperstepræsterne have overgivet dig til mig; hvad har du
      gjort?"
 36.  Jesus svarede: "Mit Rige er ikke af denne Verden. Var mit Rige
      af denne verden, havde mine Tjenere stridt for, at jeg ikke var
      bleven overgiven til Jøderne; men nu er mit Rige ikke deraf."
 37.  Da sagde Pilatus til ham: "Du er altså dog en Konge?" Jesus
      svarede: "Du siger det, jeg er en Konge. Jeg er dertil født og
      dertil kommen til Verden, at jeg skal vidne om Sandheden. Hver
      den, som er af Sandheden, hører min Røst."
 38.  Pilatus siger til ham: "Hvad er Sandhed?" Og da han havde sagt
      dette, gik han igen ud til Jøderne, og han siger til dem: "Jeg
      finder ingen Skyld hos ham.
 39.  Men I have den Skik, at jeg løslade eder en om Påsken; ville I
      da, at jeg skal løslade eder Jødernes Konge?"
 40.  Da råbte de alle igen og sagde: "Ikke ham, men Barabbas;" og
      Barabbas var en Røver.

Johannes 19

  1.  Nu tog da Pilatus Jesus og lod ham hudstryge.
  2.  Og Stridsmændene flettede en Krone af Torne og satte den på hans
      Hoved og kastede en Purpurkappe om ham, og de gik hen til ham og
      sagde:
  3.  "Hil være dig, du Jødernes Konge!" og de sloge ham i Ansigtet.
  4.  Og Pilatus gik atter ud, og han siger til dem: "Se, jeg fører
      ham ud til eder, for at I skulle vide, at jeg finder ingen Skyld
      hos ham."
  5.  Da gik Jesus ud med Tornekronen og Purpurkappen på. Og han siger
      til dem: "Se, hvilket Menneske!"
  6.  Da nu Ypperstepræsterne og Svendene så ham, råbte de og sagde:
      "Korsfæst! korsfæst!" Pilatus siger til dem: "Tager I ham og
      korsfæster ham; thi jeg finder ikke Skyld hos ham."
  7.  Jøderne svarede ham: "Vi have en Lov, og efter denne Lov er han
      skyldig at dø, fordi han har gjort sig selv til Guds Søn."
  8.  Da Pilatus nu hørte dette Ord, blev han endnu mere bange.
  9.  Og han gik ind igen i Borgen og siger til Jesus: "Hvorfra er
      du?"  Men Jesus gav ham intet Svar.
 10.  Pilatus siger da til ham: "Taler du ikke til mig? Ved du ikke,
      at jeg har Magt til at løslade dig, og at jeg har Magt til at
      korsfæste dig?"
 11.  Jesus svarede: "Du havde aldeles ingen Magt over mig, dersom den
      ikke var givet dig ovenfra; derfor har den, som overgav mig til
      dig, større Synd."
 12.  Derefter forsøgte Pilatus at løslade ham. Men Jøderne råbte og
      sagde: "Dersom du løslader denne, er du ikke Kejserens Ven. Hver
      den, som gør sig selv til Konge, sætter sig op imod Kejseren."
 13.  Da Pilatus hørte disse Ord, førte han Jesus ud og satte sig på
      Dommersædet, på det Sted, som kaldes Stenlagt, men på Hebraisk
      Gabbatha;
 14.  men det var Beredelsens dag i Påsken, ved den sjette Time. Og
      han siger til Jøderne: "Se, eders Konge!"
 15.  De råbte nu: "Bort, bort med ham! korsfæst ham!" Pilatus siger
      til dem: "Skal jeg korsfæste eders Konge?" Ypperstepræsterne
      svarede: "Vi have ingen Konge uden Kejseren."
 16.  Så overgav han ham da til dem til at korsfæstes. De toge nu
      Jesus;

 17.  og han bar selv sit Kors og gik ud til det såkaldte
      "Hovedskalsted", som hedder på Hebraisk Golgatha,
 18.  hvor de korsfæstede ham og to andre med ham, en på hver Side,
      men Jesus midt imellem.
 19.  Men Pilatus havde også skrevet en Overskrift og sat den på
      Korset. Men der var skrevet:"Jesus af Nazareth, Jødernes Konge."
 20.  Denne Overskrift læste da mange af Jøderne; thi det Sted, hvor
      Jesus blev korsfæstet, var nær ved Staden; og den var skreven på
      Hebraisk, Latin og Græsk.
 21.  Da sagde Jødernes Ypperstepræster til Pilatus: "Skriv ikke:
      Jødernes Konge, men: Han sagde: Jeg er Jødernes Konge."
 22.  Pilatus svarede: "Hvad jeg skrev, det skrev jeg."
 23.  Da nu Stridsmændene havde korsfæstet Jesus, toge de hans Klæder
      og gjorde fire Dele, een Del for hver Stridsmand, og ligeledes
      Kjortelen; men Kjortelen var usyet, vævet fra øverst helt
      igennem.
 24.  Da sagde de til hverandre: "Lader os ikke sønderskære den, men
      kaste Lod om den, hvis den skal være;" for at Skriften skulde
      opfyldes, som siger: "De delte mine Klæder imellem sig og
      kastede Lod om mit Klædebon." Dette gjorde da Stridsmændene.
 25.  Men ved Jesu Kors stod hans Moder og hans Moders Søster, Maria,
      Klopas's Hustru, og Maria Magdalene.
 26.  Da Jesus nu så sin Moder og den Discipel, han elskede, stå hos,
      siger han til sin Moder: "Kvinde! se, det er din Søn."
 27.  Derefter siger han til Disciplen: "Se, det er din Moder." Og fra
      den time tog Disciplen hende hjem til sit.
 28.  Derefter, da Jesus vidste, at alting nu var fuldbragt, for at
      Skriften skulde opfyldes, siger han: "Jeg tørster."
 29.  Der stod et Kar fuldt af Eddike; de satte da en Svamp fuld af
      Eddike på en Isopstængel og holdt den til hans Mund.
 30.  Da nu Jesus havde taget Eddiken, sagde han:"Det er fuldbragt;"
      og han bøjede Hovedet og opgav Ånden.

 31.  Da det nu var Beredelsesdag, bade Jøderne Pilatus om, at Benene
      måtte blive knuste og Legemerne nedtagne, for at de ikke skulde
      blive på Korset Sabbaten over; thi denne Sabbatsdag var stor.
 32.  Da kom Stridsmændene og knuste Benene på den første og på den
      anden; som vare korsfæstede med ham.
 33.  Men da de kom til Jesus og så, at han allerede var død, knuste
      de ikke hans Ben.
 34.  Men en af Stridsmændene stak ham i Siden med et Spyd, og straks
      flød der Blod og Vand ud.
 35.  Og den, der har set det, har vidnet det, og hans Vidnesbyrd er
      sandt, og han ved, at han siger sandt, for at også I skulle tro.
 36.  Thi disse Ting skete, for at Skriften skulde opfyldes: "Intet
      Ben skal sønderbrydes derpå".
 37.  Og atter et andet Skriftord siger: "De skulle se hen til ham,
      hvem de have gennemstunget."

 38.  Men Josef fra Arimathæa, som var en Jesu Discipel, dog lønligt,
      af Frygt for Jøderne, bad derefter Pilatus om, at han måtte tage
      Jesu Legeme, og Pilatus tillod det. Da kom han og tog Jesu
      Legeme.
 39.  Men også Nikodemus, som første Gang var kommen til Jesus om
      Natten, kom og bragte en Blanding af Myrra og Aloe, omtrent
      hundrede Pund.
 40.  De toge da Jesu Legeme og bandt det i Linklæder med de
      vellugtende Urter, som Jødernes Skik er at fly Lig til Jorde.
 41.  Men der var på det Sted, hvor han blev korsfæstet, en Have, og i
      Haven en ny Grav, hvori endnu aldrig nogen var lagt.
 42.  Der lagde de da Jesus, for Jødernes Beredelses dags Skyld,
      efterdi Graven var nær.

Johannes 20

  1.  Men på den første Dag; i Ugen kommer Maria Magdalene årle,
      medens det endnu er mørkt, til Graven og ser Stenen borttagen
      fra Graven,
  2.  Da løber hun og kommer til Simon Peter og til den anden
      Discipel, ham, hvem Jesus elskede, og siger til dem: "De have
      borttaget Herren af Graven, og vi vide ikke, hvor de have lagt
      ham."
  3.  Da gik Peter og den anden Discipel ud, og de kom til Graven.
  4.  Men de to løb sammen, og den anden Discipel løb foran, hurtigere
      end Peter, og kom først til Graven.
  5.  Og da han kiggede ind, ser han Linklæderne ligge der, men gik
      dog ikke ind.
  6.  Da kommer Simon Peter, som fulgte ham, og han gik ind i Graven
      og så Linklæderne ligge der
  7.  og Tørklædet, som han havde haft på sit Hoved, ikke liggende ved
      Linklæderne, men sammenrullet på et Sted for sig selv.
  8.  Nu gik da også den anden Discipel, som var kommen først til
      Graven, ind, og han så og troede.
  9.  Thi de forstode endnu ikke Skriften, at han skulde opstå fra de
      døde.
 10.  Da gik Disciplene atter bort til deres Hjem.

 11.  Men Maria stod udenfor ved Graven og græd. Som hun nu græd,
      kiggede hun ind i Graven,
 12.  og hun ser to Engle sidde i hvide Klæder, en ved Hovedet og en
      ved Fødderne,hvor Jesu Legeme havde ligget.
 13.  Og de sige til hende: "Kvinde! hvorfor græder du?" Hun siger til
      dem: "Fordi de have taget min Herre bort, og jeg ved ikke, hvor
      de have lagt ham."
 14.  Da hun havde sagt dette, vendte hun sig om, og hun ser Jesus stå
      der, og hun vidste ikke, at det var Jesus.
 15.  Jesus siger til hende: "Kvinde: hvorfor græder du? hvem leder du
      efter?" Hun mente, det var Havemanden, og siger til ham: "Herre!
      dersom du har båret ham bort, da sig mig, hvor du har lagt ham,
      så vil jeg tage ham."
 16.  Jesus siger til hende: "Maria!" Hun vender sig om og siger til
      ham på Hebraisk: "Rabbuni!" hvilket betyder Mester.
 17.  Jesus siger til hende: "Rør ikke ved mig, thi jeg er endnu ikke
      opfaren til min Fader; men gå til mine Brødre og sig dem: Jeg
      farer op til min Fader og eders Fader og til min Gud og eders
      Gud."
 18.  Maria Magdalene kommer og forkynder Disciplene: "Jeg har set
      Herren," og at han havde sagt hende dette.

 19.  Da det nu var Aften på den samme Dag, den første Dag i Ugen, og
      Dørene der, hvor Disciplene opholdt sig, vare lukkede af Frygt
      for Jøderne, kom Jesus og stod midt iblandt dem, og han siger
      til dem: "Fred være med eder!"
 20.  Og som han sagde dette, viste han dem sine Hænder og sin
      Side. Så bleve Disciplene glade, da de så Herren.
 21.  Jesus sagde da atter til dem: "Fred være med eder! Ligesom
      Faderen har udsendt mig, således sender også jeg eder."
 22.  Og da han havde sagt dette, åndede han på dem, og han siger til
      dem: "Modtager den Helligånd!
 23.  Hvem I forlade Synderne, dem ere de forladte, og hvem I nægte
      Forladelse, dem er den nægtet."
 24.  Men Thomas, hvilket betyder Tvilling, en af de tolv, var ikke
      hos dem, da Jesus kom.
 25.  De andre Disciple sagde da til ham: "Vi have set Herren." Men
      han sagde til dem: "Uden jeg får set Naglegabet i hans Hænder og
      stikker min Finger i Naglegabet og stikker min Hånd i hans Side,
      vil jeg ingenlunde tro."

 26.  Og otte Dage efter vare hans Disciple atter inde, og Thomas med
      dem. Jesus kommer, da Dørene vare lukkede, og han stod midt
      iblandt dem og sagde: "Fred være med eder!"
 27.  Derefter siger han til Thomas: "Ræk din Finger hid, og se mine
      Hænder, og ræk din Hånd hid, og stik den i min Side, og vær ikke
      vantro, men troende!"
 28.  Thomas svarede og sagde til ham: "Min Herre og min Gud!"
 29.  Jesus siger til ham: "Fordi du har set mig, har du troet; salige
      ere de, som ikke have set og dog troet."

 30.  Desuden gjorde Jesus mange andre Tegn for sine Disciples Åsyn,
      som ikke ere skrevne i denne Bog.
 31.  Men dette er skrevet, for at I skulle tro, at Jesus er Kristus,
      Guds Søn, og for at I, når I tro, skulle have Livet i hans Navn.

Johannes 21

  1.  Siden åbenbarede Jesus sige atter for Disciplene ved Tiberias
      Søen; men han åbenbarede sig således.
  2.  Simon Peter og Thomas, hvilket betyder Tvilling, og Nathanael
      fra Kana i Galilæa og Zebedæus's Sønner og to andre af hans,
      Disciple vare sammen.
  3.  Simon Peter siger til dem: "Jeg går ud at fiske." De sige til
      ham: "Også vi gå med dig." De gik ud og gik om Bord i Skibet, og
      den Nat fangede de intet.
  4.  Men da det nu blev Morgen, stod Jesus ved Søbredden; dog vidste
      Disciplene ikke, at det var Jesus.
  5.  Jesus siger da til dem: "Børnlille! have I noget at spise?" De
      svarede ham: "Nej."
  6.  Men han sagde til dem: "Kaster Garnet ud på højre Side af
      Skibet, så skulle I finde." Da kastede de det ud, og de formåede
      ikke mere at drage det for Fiskenes Mængde.
  7.  Den Discipel, som Jesus elskede, siger da til Peter: "Det er
      Herren." Da Simon Peter nu hørte, at det var Herren, bandt han
      sin Fiskerkjortel om sig (thi han var nøgen), og kastede sig i
      Søen.
  8.  Men de andre Disciple kom med Skibet, thi de vare ikke langt fra
      Land, kun omtrent to Hundrede Alen, og de slæbte efter sig
      Garnet med Fiskene.
  9.  Da de nu kom i Land, se de der en Kulild og Fisk ligge derpå og
      Brød.
 10.  Jesus siger til dem: "Bringer hid af de Fisk, som I nu fangede."
 11.  Simon Peter steg op og trak Garnet på Land, fuldt af store Fisk,
      et Hundrede og tre og halvtredsindstyve, og skønt de vare så
      mange, sønderreves Garnet ikke.
 12.  Jesus siger til dem: "Kommer og holder Måltid! Men, ingen af
      Disciplene vovede at spørge ham: "Hvem er du?" thi de vidste, at
      det var Herren.
 13.  Jesus kommer og tager Brødet og giver dem det, ligeledes også
      Fiskene.
 14.  Dette var allerede den tredje Gang, at Jesus åbenbarede sig for
      sine Disciple, efter at han var oprejst fra de døde.

 15.  Da de nu havde holdt Måltid, siger Jesus til Simon Peter:
      "Simon, Johannes's Søn, elsker du mig mere end disse?" Han siger
      til ham: "Ja, Herre! du ved,at jeg har dig kær." Han siger til
      ham: "Vogt mine Lam!"
 16.  Han siger atter anden Gang til ham: "Simon, Johannes's Søn,
      elsker du mig?" Han siger til ham: "Ja, Herre! du ved, at jeg
      har dig kær."  Han siger til ham: "Vær Hyrde for mine Får!"
 17.  Han siger tredje Gang til ham: "Simon, Johannes's Søn, har du
      mig kær?" Peter blev bedrøvet, fordi han tredje Gang sagde til
      ham: "Har du mig kær?" Og han sagde til ham: "Herre! du kender
      alle Ting, du ved, at jeg har dig kær." Jesus siger til ham:
      "Vogt mine Får!
 18.  Sandelig, sandelig, siger jeg dig, da du var yngre, bandt du
      selv op om dig og gik, hvorhen du vilde; men når du bliver
      gammel, skal du udrække dine Hænder, og en anden skal binde op
      om dig og føre dig derhen, hvor du ikke vil."
 19.  Men dette sagde han for at betegne, med hvilken Død han skulde
      herliggøre Gud. Og da han havde sagt dette, siger han til ham:
      "Følg mig!"

 20.  Peter vendte sig og så den Discipel følge, som Jesus elskede, og
      som også lå op til hans Bryst ved Nadveren og sagde: "Herre!
      hvem er den, som forråder dig?"
 21.  Da nu Peter så ham, siger han til Jesus: "Herre! men hvorledes
      skal det gå denne?"
 22.  Jesus siger til ham: "Dersom jeg vil, at han skal blive, indtil
      jeg kommer, hvad vedkommer det dig? Følg du mig!"
 23.  Så kom da dette Ord ud iblandt Brødrene: "Denne Discipel dør
      ikke;" og Jesus havde dog ikke sagt til ham, at han ikke skulde
      dø, men: "Dersom jeg vil, at han skal blive, indtil jeg kommer,
      hvad vedkommer det dig?"
 24.  Dette er den Discipel, som vidner om disse Ting og har skrevet
      dette; og vi vide, at hans Vidnesbyrd er sandt.

 25.  Men der er også mange andre Ting, som Jesus har gjort, og dersom
      de skulde skrives enkeltvis. mener jeg, at ikke hele Verden
      kunde rumme de Bøger, som da bleve skrevne.


Apostelenes gerninger

Apostelenes gerninger 1

  1.  Den første Bog skrev jeg, o Theofilus! om alt det, som Jesus
      begyndte både at gøre og lære,
  2.  indtil den Dag, da han blev optagen, efter at han havde givet
      Apostlene, som han havde udvalgt, Befaling ved den Helligånd;
  3.  for hvem han også, efter at han havde lidt, fremstillede sig
      levende ved mange Beviser, idet han viste sig for dem i
      fyrretyve Dage og talte om de Ting, der høre til Guds Rige.
  4.  Og medens han var sammen med dem, bød han dem, at de ikke måtte
      vige fra Jerusalem, men skulde oppebie Faderens Forjættelse,
      "hvorom," sagde han, "I have hørt af mig.
  5.  Thi Johannes døbte med Vand; men I skulle døbes med den
      Helligånd om ikke mange Dage."
  6.  Som de nu vare forsamlede, spurgte de ham og sagde: "Herre!
      opretter du på denne Tid Riget igen for Israel?"
  7.  Men han sagde til dem: "Det tilkommer ikke eder at kende Tider
      eller Timer, hvilke Faderen har fastsat i sin egen Magt.
  8.  Men I skulle få Kraft, når den Helligånd kommer over eder; og I
      skulle være mine Vidner både i Jerusalem og i hele Judæa og
      Samaria og indtil Jordens Ende."
  9.  Og da han havde sagt dette, blev han optagen, medens de så
      derpå, og en Sky tog ham bort fra deres Øjne.
 10.  Og som de stirrede op imod Himmelen, medens han for bort, se, da
      stode to Mænd hos dem i hvide Klæder,
 11.  og de sagde: "I galilæiske Mænd, hvorfor stå I og se op imod
      Himmelen? Denne Jesus, som er optagen fra eder til Himmelen,
      skal komme igen på samme Måde, som I have set ham fare til
      Himmelen."

 12.  Da vendte de tilbage til Jerusalem fra det Bjerg, som kaldes
      Oliebjerget og er nær ved Jerusalem, en Sabbatsvej derfra.
 13.  Og da de kom derind, gik de op på den Sal, hvor de plejede at
      opholde sig, Peter og Johannes og Jakob og Andreas, Filip og
      Thomas, Bartholomæus og Matthæus, Jakob, Alfæus's Søn og Simon
      Zelotes, og Judas, Jakobs Søn.
 14.  Alle disse vare endrægtigt vedholdende i Bønnen tillige med
      nogle Kvinder og Maria, Jesu Moder, og med hans Brødre.
 15.  Og i disse Dage stod Peter op midt iblandt Brødrene og sagde:
      (og der var en Skare samlet på omtrent hundrede og tyve
      Personer):
 16.  "I Mænd, Brødre! det Skriftens Ord burde opfyldes, som den
      Helligånd forud havde talt ved Davids Mund om Judas, der blev
      Vejleder for dem, som grebe Jesus;
 17.  thi han var regnet iblandt os og havde fået denne Tjenestes Lod.
 18.  Han erhvervede sig nu en Ager for sin Uretfærdigheds Løn, og han
      styrtede ned og brast itu, og alle hans Indvolde væltede ud,
 19.  hvilket også er blevet vitterligt for alle dem, som bo i
      Jerusalem, så at den Ager kaldes på deres eget Mål Hakeldama,
      det er Blodager.
 20.  Thi der er skrevet i Salmernes Bog: "Hans Bolig blive øde, og
      der være ingen, som bor i den," og: "Lad en anden få hans
      Tilsynsgerning."
 21.  Derfor bør en af de Mænd, som vare sammen med os i hele den Tid,
      da den Herre Jesus gik ind og gik ud hos os,
 22.  lige fra Johannes's Dåb indtil den Dag, da han blev optagen fra
      os, blive Vidne sammen med os om hans Opstandelse."
 23.  Og de fremstillede to, Josef, som kaldtes Barsabbas med Tilnavn
      Justus, og Matthias.
 24.  Og de bade og sagde: "Du Herre! som kender alles Hjerter, vis os
      den ene, som du har udvalgt af disse to
 25.  til at få denne Tjenestes og Apostelgernings Plads, som Judas
      forlod for at gå hen til sit eget Sted."
 26.  Og de kastede Lod imellem dem, og Loddet faldt på Matthias. og
      han blev regnet sammen med de elleve Apostle.

Apostelenes gerninger 2

  1.  Og da Pinsefestens Dag kom, vare de alle endrægtigt forsamlede.
  2.  Og der kom pludseligt fra Himmelen en Lyd som af et fremfarende
      vældigt Vejr og fyldte hele Huset, hvor de sade.
  3.  Og der viste sig for dem Tunger som af Ild, der fordelte sig og
      satte sig på hver enkelt af dem.
  4.  Og de bleve alle fyldte med den Helligånd, og de begyndte at
      tale i andre Tungemål, efter hvad Ånden gav dem at udsige.
  5.  Men der var Jøder, bosiddende i Jerusalem, gudfrygtige Mænd af
      alle Folkeslag under Himmelen.
  6.  Da denne Lyd kom, strømmede Mængden sammen og blev forvirret;
      thi hver enkelt hørte dem tale på hans eget Mål.
  7.  Og de forbavsedes alle og undrede sig og sagde: "Se, ere ikke
      alle disse, som tale, Galilæere?
  8.  Hvor kunne vi da høre dem tale, hver på vort eget Mål, hvor vi
      ere fødte,
  9.  Parthere og Medere og Elamiter, og vi, som høre hjemme i
      Mesopotamien, Judæa og Happadokien. Pontus og Asien,
 10.  i Frygien og Pamfylien, Ægypten og Libyens Egne ved Kyrene, og
      vi her boende Romere,
 11.  Jøder og Proselyter, Kretere og Arabere, vi høre dem tale om
      Guds store Gerninger i vore Tungemål?"
 12.  Og de forbavsedes alle og,vare tvivlrådige og sagde den ene til
      den anden: "Hvad kan dette være?"
 13.  Men andre sagde spottende: "De ere fulde af sød Vin."

 14.  Da stod Peter frem med de elleve og opløftede sin Røst og talte
      til dem: "I jødiske Mænd og alle I, som bo i Jerusalem! dette
      være eder vitterligt, og låner Øre til mine Ord!
 15.  Thi disse ere ikke drukne, som I mene; det er jo den tredje Time
      på Dagen;
 16.  men dette er, hvad der et sagt ved Profeten Joel:
 17.  "Og det skal ske i de sidste Dage, siger Gud, da vil jeg udgyde
      af min Ånd over alt Kød; og eders Sønner og eders Døtre skulle
      profetere, og de unge iblandt eder skulle se Syner, og de gamle
      iblandt eder skulle have Drømme.
 18.  Ja, endog over mine Trælle og over mine Trælkvinder vil jeg i de
      Dage udgyde af min Ånd, og de skulle profetere.
 19.  Og jeg vil lade ske Undere på Himmelen oventil og Tegn på Jorden
      nedentil, Blod og Ild og rygende Damp.
 20.  Solen skal forvandles til Mørke og Månen til Blod, førend
      Herrens store og herlige Dag kommer.
 21.  Og det skal ske, enhver, som påkalder Herrens Navn, skal
      frelses."
 22.  I israelitiske Mænd! hører disse Ord: Jesus af Nazareth, en
      Mand, som fra Gud var godtgjort for eder ved kraftige Gerninger
      og Undere og Tegn, hvilke Gud gjorde ved ham midt iblandt eder,
      som I jo selv vide,
 23.  ham, som efter Guds bestemte Rådslutning og Forudviden var
      bleven forrådt, ham have I ved lovløses Hånd korsfæstet og
      ihjelslået.
 24.  Men Gud oprejste ham, idet han gjorde Ende på Dødens Veer,
      eftersom det ikke var muligt, at han kunde fastholdes af den.
 25.  Thi David siger med Henblik på ham: "Jeg havde altid Herren for
      mine Øjne; thi han er ved min højre Hånd, for at jeg ikke skal
      rokkes,
 26.  Derfor glædede mit Hjerte sig, og min Tunge jublede, ja, også
      mit Kød skal bo i Håb;
 27.  thi du skal ikke lade min Sjæl tilbage i Dødsriget, ikke heller
      tilstede din hellige at se Forrådnelse,
 28.  Du har kundgjort mig Livets Veje; du skal fylde mig med Glæde
      for dit Åsyn."
 29.  I Mænd Brødre! Jeg kan sige med Frimodighed til eder om
      Patriarken David, at han er både død og begraven, og hans Grav
      er hos os indtil denne Dag.
 30.  Da han nu var en Profet og vidste, at Gud med Ed havde tilsvoret
      ham, at af hans Lænds Frugt skulde en sidde på hans Trone,
 31.  talte han, forudseende, om Kristi Opstandelse, at hverken blev
      han ladt tilbage i Dødsriget, ej heller så hans Kød Forrådnelse.
 32.  Denne Jesus oprejste Gud, hvorom vi alle ere Vidner.
 33.  Efter at han nu ved Guds højre Hånd er ophøjet og af Faderen har
      fået den Helligånds Forjættelse, har han udgydt denne, hvilket I
      både se og høre.
 34.  Thi David for ikke op til Himmelen; men han siger selv: "Herren
      sagde til min Herre: Sæt dig ved min højre Hånd,
 35.  indtil jeg får lagt dine Fjender som en Skammel for dine
      Fødder."
 36.  Derfor skal hele Israels Hus vide for vist, at denne Jesus, hvem
      I korsfæstede, har Gud gjort både til Herre og til Kristus,"

 37.  Men da de hørte dette, stak det dem i Hjertet, og de sagde til
      Peter og de øvrige Apostle: "I Mænd, Brødre! hvad skulle vi
      gøre?"
 38.  Men Peter sagde til dem: "Omvender eder, og hver af eder lade
      sig døbe på Jesu Kristi Navn til eders Synders Forladelse; og I
      skulle få den Helligånds Gave.
 39.  Thi for eder er Forjættelsen og for eders Børn og for alle dem,
      som ere langt borte, så mange som Herren vor Gud vil tilkalde."
 40.  Også med mange andre Ord vidnede han for dem og format dem, idet
      han sagde: "Lader eder frelse fra denne vanartede Slægt!"
 41.  De, som nu toge imod hans Ord, bleve døbte; og der føjedes samme
      Dag omtrent tre Tusinde Sjæle til.

 42.  Og de holdt fast ved Apostlenes Lære og Samfundet, Brødets
      Brydelse og Bønnerne.
 43.  Men der kom Frygt over en hver Sjæl, og der skete mange Undere
      og Tegn ved Apostlene.
 44.  Og alle de troende holdt sig sammen og havde alle Ting fælles.
 45.  Og de solgte deres Ejendom og Gods og delte det ud iblandt alle,
      efter hvad enhver havde Trang til.
 46.  Og idet de hver Dag vedholdende og endrægtigt kom i Helligdommen
      og brød Brødet hjemme, fik de deres Føde med Fryd og i Hjertets
      Enfold,
 47.  idet de lovede Gud og havde Yndest hos hele Folket. Men Herren
      føjede daglig til dem nogle, som lode sig frelse.

Apostelenes gerninger 3

  1.  Men Peter og Johannes gik op i Helligdommen ved Bedetimen, den
      niende Time.
  2.  Og en Mand, som var lam fra Moders Liv af, blev båren frem; ham
      satte de daglig ved den Dør til Helligdommen, som kaldtes den
      skønne, for at han kunde bede dem, som gik ind i Helligdommen,
      om Almisse.
  3.  Da han så Peter og Johannes, idet de vilde gå ind i
      Helligdommen, bad han om at få en Almisse.
  4.  Da så Peter tillige med Johannes fast på ham og sagde: "Se på
      os!"
  5.  Og han gav Agt på dem, efterdi han ventede at få noget af dem.
  6.  Men Peter sagde: "Sølv og Guld ejer jeg ikke, men hvad jeg har,
      det giver jeg dig: I Jesu Kristi Nazaræerens Navn stå op og gå!"
  7.  Og han greb ham ved den højre Hånd og rejste ham op.
  8.  Men straks bleve hans Ben og Ankler stærke, og han sprang op og
      stod og gik omkring og gik med dem ind i Helligdommen, hvor han
      gik omkring og sprang og lovede Gud.
  9.  Og hele Folket så ham gå omkring og love Gud.
 10.  Og de kendte ham som den, der havde siddet ved den skønne Port
      til Helligdommen for at få Almisse; og de bleve fulde af Rædsel
      og Forfærdelse over det, som var timedes ham.
 11.  Medens han nu holdt fast ved Peter og Johannes, løb alt Folket
      rædselsslagent sammen om dem i den Søjlegang, som kaldes
      Salomons.

 12.  Men da Peter så det, talte han til Folket: "I israelitiske Mænd!
      Hvorfor undre I eder over dette? eller hvorfor stirre I på os,
      som om vi af egen Magt eller Gudfrygtighed havde gjort, at han
      kan gå?
 13.  Abrahams og Isaks og Jakobs Gud, vore Fædres Gud, har
      herliggjort sin Tjener" Jesus, hvem I prisgave og fornægtede for
      Pilatus, da han dømte, at han skulde løslades.
 14.  Men I fornægtede den hellige og retfærdige og bade om, at en
      Morder måtte skænkes eder.
 15.  Men Livets Fyrste sloge I ihjel, hvem Gud oprejste fra de døde,
      hvorom vi ere Vidner.
 16.  Og i Troen på hans Navn har hans Navn styrket denne, hvem I se
      og kende, og Troen, som virkedes ved ham, har givet denne hans
      Førlighed i Påsyn af eder alle.
 17.  Og nu, Brødre! jeg ved, at I handlede i Uvidenhed, ligesom også
      eders Rådsherrer.
 18.  Men Gud har således fuldbyrdet, hvad han forud forkyndte ved
      alle Profeternes Mund, at hans Salvede skulde lide.
 19.  Derfor fatter et andet Sind og vender om, for at eders Synder må
      blive udslettede, for at Vederkvægelsens Tider må komme fra
      Herrens Åsyn,
 20.  og han må sende den for eder bestemte Kristus, Jesus,
 21.  hvem Himmelen skal modtage indtil alle Tings Genoprettelses
      Tider, hvorom Gud har talt ved sine hellige Profeters Mund fra
      de ældste Dage.
 22.  Moses sagde: "En Profet skal Herren eders Gud oprejse eder af
      eders Brødre ligesom mig; ham skulle I høre i alt, hvad han end
      vil tale til eder.
 23.  Men det skal ske, hver Sjæl, som ikke hører den Profet, skal
      udryddes af Folket."
 24.  Men også alle Profeterne, fra Samuel af og derefter, så mange
      som talte, have også forkyndt disse Dage.
 25.  I ere Profeternes Sønner og Sønner af den Pagt, som Gud sluttede
      med vore Fædre, da han sagde til Abraham: "Og i din Sæd skulle
      alle Jordens Slægter velsignes."
 26.  For eder først har Gud oprejst sin Tjener og sendt han for at
      velsigne eder, når enhver af eder vender om fra sin Ondskab."

Apostelenes gerninger 4

  1.  Men medens de talte til Folket, kom Præsterne og Høvedsmanden
      for Helligdommen og Saddukæerne over dem,
  2.  da de harmedes over, at de lærte Folket og i Jesus forkyndte
      Opstandelsen fra de døde.
  3.  Og de lagde Hånd på dem og satte dem i Forvaring til den
      følgende Dag; thi det var allerede Aften.
  4.  Men mange af dem, som havde hørt Ordet, troede, og Tallet på
      Mændene blev omtrent fem Tusinde.
  5.  Men det skete Dagen derefter, at deres Rådsherrer og Ældste og
      skriftkloge forsamlede sig i Jerusalem,
  6.  ligeså Ypperstepræsten Annas og Kajfas og Johannes og Alexander
      og alle, som vare af ypperstepræstelig Slægt.
  7.  Og de stillede dem midt iblandt sig og spurgte: "Af hvad Magt
      eller i hvilket Navn have I gjort dette?"
  8.  Da sagde Peter, fyldt med den Helligånd, til dem: "I Folkets
      Rådsherrer og Ældste!
  9.  Når vi i Dag forhøres angående denne Velgerning imod en vanfør
      Mand, om hvorved han er bleven helbredt;
 10.  da skal det være eder alle og hele Israels Folk vitterligt, at
      ved Jesu Kristi Nazaræerens Navn, hvem I have korsfæstet, hvem
      Gud har oprejst fra de døde, ved dette Navn er det, at denne
      står rask her for eders Øjne,
 11.  Han er den Sten, som blev agtet for intet af eder, I
      Bygningsmænd, men som er bleven til en Hovedhjørnesten.
 12.  Og der er ikke Frelse i nogen anden; thi der er ikke noget andet
      Navn under Himmelen, givet iblandt Mennesker, ved hvilket vi
      skulle blive frelste."
 13.  Men da de så Peters og Johannes Frimodighed og kunde mærke, at
      de vare ulærde Mænd og Lægfolk, forundrede de sig, og de kendte
      dem, at de havde været med Jesus.
 14.  Og da de så Manden, som var helbredt, stå hos dem, havde de
      intet at sige derimod.
 15.  Men de bøde dem at træde ud fra Rådet og rådførte sig med
      hverandre og sagde:
 16.  "Hvad skulle vi gøre med disse Mennesker? thi at et vitterligt
      Tegn er sket ved dem, det er åbenbart for alle dem, som bo i
      Jerusalem, og vi kunne ikke nægte det.
 17.  Men for at det ikke skal komme videre ud iblandt Folket, da
      lader os true dem til ikke mere at tale til noget Menneske i
      dette Navn."
 18.  Og de kaldte dem ind og forbøde dem aldeles at tale eller lære i
      Jesu Navn.
 19.  Men Peter og Johannes svarede og sagde til dem: "Dømmer selv. om
      det er ret for Gud at lyde eder mere end Gud.
 20.  Thi vi kunne ikke lade være at tale om det, som vi have set og
      hørt."
 21.  Men de truede dem end mere og løslode dem, da de ikke kunde
      udfinde, hvorledes de skulde straffe dem, for Folkets Skyld; thi
      alle priste Gud for det, som var sket.
 22.  Thi den Mand, på hvem dette Helbredelsestegn var sket, var mere
      end fyrretyve År gammel.

 23.  Da de nu vare løsladte, kom de til deres egne og fortalte dem
      alt, hvad Ypperstepræsterne og de Ældste havde sagt til dem.
 24.  Men da de hørte dette, opløftede de endrægtigt Røsten til Gud og
      sagde: "Herre, du, som har gjort Himmelen og Jorden og Havet og
      alle Ting, som ere i dem,
 25.  du, som har sagt ved din Tjener Davids Mund: "Hvorfor fnyste
      Hedninger, og Folkeslag oplagde forfængelige Råd?
 26.  Jordens Konger rejste sig, og Fyrsterne samlede sig til Hobe
      imod Herren og imod hans Salvede."
 27.  Ja, de have i Sandhed forsamlet sig i denne Stad imod din
      hellige Tjener Jesus, hvem du har salvet, både Herodes og
      Pontius Pilatus tillige med Hedningerne og Israels Folkestammer
 28.  for at gøre det, som din Hånd og dit Råd forud havde bestemt
      skulde ske.
 29.  Og nu, Herre! se til deres Trusler, og giv dine Tjenere at tale
      dit Ord med al Frimodighed,
 30.  idet du udrækker din Hånd til Helbredelse, og der sker Tegn og
      Undere ved din hellige Tjeners Jesu Navn."
 31.  Og da de havde bedt, rystedes Stedet, hvor de vare forsamlede;
      og de bleve alle fyldte med den Helligånd, og de talte Guds Ord
      med Frimodighed.
 32.  Men de troendes Mængde havde eet Hjerte og een Sjæl; og end ikke
      een kaldte noget af det, han ejede, sit eget; men de havde alle
      Ting fælles.
 33.  Og med stor Kraft aflagde Apostlene Vidnesbyrdet om den Herres
      Jesu Opstandelse, og der var stor Nåde over dem alle.
 34.  Thi der var end ikke nogen trængende iblandt dem; thi alle de,
      som vare Ejere af Jordstykker eller Huse, solgte dem og bragte
      Salgssummerne
 35.  og lagde dem for Apostlenes Fødder; men der blev uddelt til
      enhver, efter hvad han havde Trang til.
 36.  Og Josef, som af Apostlene fik Tilnavnet Barnabas, (det er
      udlagt: Trøstens Søn), en Levit, født på Kypern
 37.  som ejede en Jordlod, solgte den og bragte Pengene og lagde dem
      for Apostlenes Fødder.

Apostelenes gerninger 5

  1.  Men en Mand, ved Navn Ananias, tillige med Safira, hans Hustru,
      solgte en Ejendom
  2.  og stak med sin Hustrus Vidende noget af Værdien til Side og
      bragte en Del deraf og lagde den for Apostlenes Fødder.
  3.  Men Peter sagde: "Ananias! hvorfor har Satan fyldt dit Hjerte,
      så du har løjet imod den Helligånd og stukket noget til Side af
      Summen for Jordstykket?
  4.  Var det ikke dit, så længe du ejede det, og stod ikke det, som
      det blev solgt for, til din Rådighed? Hvorfor har du dog sat dig
      denne Gerning for i dit Hjerte? Du har ikke løjet for Mennesker,
      men for Gud."
  5.  Men da Ananias hørte disse Ord, faldt han om og udåndede. Og der
      kom stor Frygt over alle, som hørte det.
  6.  Men de unge Mænd stode op og lagde ham til Rette og bare ham ud
      og begravede ham.
  7.  Men det skete omtrent tre Timer derefter, da kom hans Hustru ind
      uden at vide, hvad der var sket.
  8.  Da sagde Peter til hende: "Sig mig, om I solgte Jordstykket til
      den Pris?" Og hun sagde: "Ja, til den Pris."
  9.  Men Peter sagde til hende: "Hvorfor ere I dog blevne enige om at
      friste Herrens Ånd? Se, deres Fødder, som have begravet din
      Mand, ere for Døren, og de skulle bære dig ud."
 10.  Men hun faldt straks om for hans Fødder og udåndede. Men da de
      unge Mænd kom ind, fandt de hende død, og de bare hende ud og
      begravede hende hos hendes Mand.
 11.  Og stor Frygt kom over hele Menigheden og over alle, som hørte
      dette.

 12.  Men ved Apostlenes Hænder skete der mange Tegn og Undere iblandt
      Folket; og de vare alle endrægtigt sammen i Salomons Søjlegang.
 13.  Men af de andre turde ingen holde sig til dem; dog priste Folket
      dem højt,
 14.  og der føjedes stedse flere troende til Herren, Skarer både af
      Mænd og Kvinder,
 15.  så at de endogså bare de syge ud på Gaderne og lagde dem på
      Senge og Løjbænke, for at når Peter kom, endog blot hans Skygge
      kunde overskygge nogen af dem.
 16.  Ja, selv fra Byerne i Jerusalems Omegn strømmede Mængden sammen
      og bragte syge og sådanne, som vare plagede af urene Ånder, og
      de bleve alle helbredte.

 17.  Men Ypperstepræsten stod op samt alle de, som holdt med ham,
      nemlig Saddukæernes Parti, og de bleve fulde af Nidkærhed.
 18.  Og de lagde Hånd på Apostlene og satte dem i offentlig
      Forvaring.
 19.  Men en Herrens Engel åbnede Fængselets Døre om Natten og førte
      dem ud og sagde:
 20.  "Går hen og træder frem og taler i Helligdommen alle disse
      Livets Ord for Folket!"
 21.  Men da de havde hørt dette, gik de ved Daggry ind i Helligdommen
      og lærte. Men Ypperstepræsten og de, som holdt med ham, kom og
      sammenkaldte Rådet og alle Israels Børns Ældste og sendte Bud
      til Fængselet, at de skulde føres frem.
 22.  Men da Tjenerne kom derhen, fandt de dem ikke i Fængselet; og de
      kom tilbage og meldte det og sagde:
 23.  "Fængselet fandt vi tillukket helt forsvarligt, og Vogterne
      stående ved Dørene; men da vi lukkede op, fandt vi ingen
      derinde."
 24.  Men da Høvedsmanden for Helligdommen og Ypperstepræsterne hørte
      disse Ord, bleve de tvivlrådige om dem,hvad dette skulde blive
      til.
 25.  Men der kom en og meldte dem: "Se, de Mænd, som I satte i
      Fængselet, stå i Helligdommen og lære Folket."
 26.  Da gik Høvedsmanden hen med Tjenerne og hentede dem, dog ikke
      med Magt; thi de frygtede for Folket, at de skulde blive
      stenede.
 27.  Men da de havde hentet dem, stillede de dem for Rådet; og
      Ypperstepræsten spurgte dem og sagde:
 28.  "Vi bøde eder alvorligt, at I ikke måtte lære i dette Navn, og
      se, I have fyldt Jerusalem med eders Lære, og I ville bringe
      dette Menneskes Blod over os!"
 29.  Men Peter og Apostlene svarede og sagde: "Man bør adlyde Gud
      mere end Mennesker.
 30.  Vore Fædres Gud oprejste Jesus, hvem I hængte på et Træ og sloge
      ihjel.
 31.  Ham har Gud ved sin højre Hånd ophøjet til en Fyrste og Frelser
      for at give Israel Omvendelse og Syndernes Forladelse.
 32.  Og vi ere hans Vidner om disse Ting, ligesom også den Helligånd,
      som Gud har givet dem, der adlyde ham."

 33.  Men da de hørte dette, skar det dem i Hjertet, og de rådsloge om
      at slå dem ihjel.
 34.  Men der rejste sig i Rådet en Farisæer ved Navn Gamaliel, en
      Lovlærer, højt agtet af hele Folket, og han bød, at de skulde
      lade Mændene træde lidt udenfor.
 35.  Og han sagde til dem: "I israelitiske Mænd! ser eder vel for,
      hvad I gøre med disse Mennesker.
 36.  Thi for nogen Tid siden fremstod Theudas, som udgav sig selv for
      at være noget, og et Antal af omtrent fire Hundrede Mænd
      sluttede sig til ham; han blev slået ihjel, og alle de, som
      adløde ham, adsplittedes og bleve til intet.
 37.  Efter ham fremstod Judas Galilæeren i Skatteindskrivningens Dage
      og fik en Flok Mennesker til at følge sig. Også han omkom, og
      alle de, som adløde ham, bleve adspredte.
 38.  Og nu siger jeg eder: Holder eder fra disse Mennesker, og lader
      dem fare; thi dersom dette Råd eller dette Værk er af Mennesker,
      bliver det til intet;
 39.  men er det af Gud, kunne I ikke gøre dem til intet. Lader eder
      dog ikke findes som de, der endog ville stride mod Gud!"

 40.  Og de adløde ham; og de kaldte Apostlene frem og lode dem piske
      og forbøde dem at tale i Jesu Navn og løslode dem.
 41.  Så gik de da glade bort fra Rådets Åsyn, fordi de vare blevne
      agtede værdige til at vanæres for hans Navns Skyld.
 42.  Og de holdt ikke op med hver Dag at lære i Helligdommen og i
      Husene og at forkynde Evangeliet om Kristus Jesus.

Apostelenes gerninger 6

  1.  Men da i de Dage Disciplenes Antal forøgedes, begyndte
      Hellenisterne at knurre imod Hebræerne", fordi deres Enker bleve
      tilsidesatte ved den daglige Uddeling.
  2.  Da sammenkaldte de tolv Disciplenes Skare og sagde: "Det huer os
      ikke at forlade Guds Ord for at tjene ved Bordene.
  3.  Udser derfor, Brødre! iblandt eder syv Mænd, som have godt
      Vidnesbyrd og ere fulde af Ånd og Visdom; dem ville vi så
      indsætte til denne Gerning.
  4.  Men vi ville holde trolig ved i Bønnen og Ordets Tjeneste."
  5.  Og denne Tale behagede hele Mængden; og de udvalgte Stefanus. en
      Mand fuld af Tro og den Helligånd, og Filip og Prokorus og
      Nikaiior og Timon og Parmenas og Nikolaus, en Proselyt fra
      Antiokia;
  6.  dem stillede de frem for Apostlene; og disse bade og lagde
      Hænderne på dem.

  7.  Og Guds Ord havde Fremgang og Disciplenes Tal forøgedes meget i
      Jerusalem; og en stor Mængde af Præsterne adløde Troen.

  8.  Men Stefanus, fuld af Nåde og Kraft, gjorde Undere og store Tegn
      iblandt Folket,
  9.  Da stod der nogle frem af den Synagoge, som kaldes de frigivnes
      og Kyrenæernes og Aleksandrinernes, og nogle af dem fra Kilikien
      og Asien, og de tvistedes med Stefanus.
 10.  Og de kunde ikke modstå den Visdom og den Ånd, som han talte af.
 11.  Da fik de hemmeligt nogle Mænd til at sige: "Vi have hørt ham
      tale bespottelige Ord imod Moses og imod Gud."
 12.  Og de ophidsede Folket og de Ældste og de skriftkloge, og de
      overfaldt ham og slæbte ham med sig og førte ham for Rådet;
 13.  og de fremstillede falske Vidner, som sagde: "Dette Menneske
      holder ikke op med at tale Ord imod dette hellige Sted og imod
      Loven.
 14.  Thi vi have hørt ham sige, at denne Jesus af Nazareth skal
      nedbryde dette Sted og forandre de Skikke, som Moses har
      overgivet os."
 15.  Og alle de, som sade i Rådet, stirrede på ham, og de så hans
      Ansigt som en Engels Ansigt.

Apostelenes gerninger 7

  1.  Men Ypperstepræsten sagde: "Forholder dette sig således?"
  2.  Men han sagde: "I Mænd, Brødre og Fædre, hører til! Herlighedens
      Gud viste sig for vor Fader Abraham, da han var i Mesopotamien,
      førend han tog Bolig i Karan.
  3.  Og han sagde til ham: "Gå ud af dit Land og fra din Slægt, og
      kom til det Land, som jeg vil vise dig."
  4.  Da gik han ud fra Kaldæernes Land og tog Bolig i Karan; og efter
      hans Faders Død lod Gud ham flytte derfra hen i dette Land, hvor
      I nu bo.
  5.  Og han gav ham ikke Ejendom deri, end ikke en Fodsbred; dog
      forjættede han ham at give ham det til Eje og hans Sæd efter
      ham, endskønt han intet Barn havde.
  6.  Men Gud talte således: "Hans Sæd skal være Udlændinge i et
      fremmed Land, og man skal gøre dem til Trælle og handle ilde med
      dem i fire Hundrede År.
  7.  Og det Folk, for hvilket de skulle trælle, vil jeg dømme, sagde
      Gud; og derefter skulle de drage ud og tjene mig på dette Sted."
  8.  Og han gav ham Omskærelsens Pagt. Og så avlede han Isak og
      omskar ham den ottende Dag, og Isak avlede Jakob, og Jakob de
      tolv Patriarker.
  9.  Og Patriarkerne bare Avind imod Josef og solgte ham til Ægypten;
      og Gud var med ham,
 10.  og han udfriede ham af alle hans Trængsler og gav ham Nåde og
      Visdom for Farao, Kongen i Ægypten, som satte ham til Øverste
      over Ægypten og over hele sit Hus.
 11.  Men der kom Hungersnød over hele Ægypten og Kanån og en stor
      Trængsel, og vore Fædre fandt ikke Føde.
 12.  Men da Jakob hørte, at der var Korn i Ægypten, sendte han vore
      Fædre ud første Gang.
 13.  Og anden Gang blev Josef genkendt af sine Brødre, og Josefs
      Herkomst blev åbenbar for Farao.
 14.  Men Josef sendte Bud og lod sin Fader Jakob og al sin Slægt
      kalde til sig, fem og halvfjerdsindstyve Sjæle.
 15.  Og Jakob drog ned til Ægypten. Og han og vore Fædre døde,
 16.  og de bleve flyttede til Sikem og lagte i den Grav, som Abraham
      havde købt for en Sum Penge af Hemors Sønner i Sikem.
 17.  Som nu Tiden nærmede sig for den Forjættelse, Gud havde tilsagt
      Abraham, voksede Folket og formeredes i Ægypten,
 18.  indtil der fremstod en anden Konge, som ikke kendte Josef.
 19.  Han viste Træskhed imod vor Slægt og handlede ilde med vore
      Fædre, så de måtte sætte deres små Børn ud, for at de ikke
      skulde holdes i Live.
 20.  På den Tid blev Moses født, og han var dejlig for Gud; han blev
      opfostret i tre Måneder i sin Faders Hus.
 21.  Men da han var sat ud, tog Faraos Datter ham op og opfostrede
      ham til sin Søn.
 22.  Og Moses blev oplært i al Ægypternes Visdom; og han var mægtig i
      sine Ord og Gerninger.
 23.  Men da han blev fyrretyve År gammel, fik han i Sinde at besøge
      sine Brødre, Israels Børn.
 24.  Og da han så en lide Uret, forsvarede han ham og hævnede den
      mishandlede, idet han slog Ægypteren ihjel.
 25.  Men han mente, at hans Brødre forstode, at Gud gav dem Frelse
      ved hans Hånd; men de forstode det ikke.
 26.  Og den næste Dag viste han sig iblandt dem under en Strid og
      vilde forlige dem til at holde Fred, sigende: "I Mænd! I ere
      Brødre, hvorfor gøre I hinanden Uret?"
 27.  Men den, som gjorde sin Næste Uret, stødte ham fra sig og sagde:
      "Hvem har sat dig til Hersker og Dommer over os?
 28.  Vil du slå mig ihjel, ligesom du i Går slog Ægypteren ihjel?"
 29.  Da flygtede Moses for denne Tales Skyld og boede som fremmed i
      Midians Land, hvor han avlede to Sønner.
 30.  Og efter fyrretyve Års Forløb viste en Engel sig for ham i Sinai
      Bjergs Ørken i en Tornebusk, der stod i lys Lue.
 31.  Men da Moses så det, undrede han sig over Synet, og da han gik
      hen for at betragte det, lød Herrens Røst til ham:
 32.  "Jeg er dine Fædres Gud, Abrahams og Isaks og Jakobs Gud." Da
      bævede Moses og turde ikke se derhen.
 33.  Men Herren sagde til ham: "Løs Skoene af dine Fødder; thi det
      Sted, som du står på, er hellig Jord.
 34.  Jeg har grant set mit Folks Mishandling i Ægypten og hørt deres
      Suk, og jeg er stegen ned for at udfri dem; og nu kom, lad mig
      sende dig til Ægypten!"
 35.  Denne Moses, hvem de fornægtede, idet de sagde: "Hvem har sat
      dig til Hersker og Dommer," ham har Gud sendt til at være både
      Hersker og Befrier ved den Engels Hånd,som viste sig for ham i
      Tornebusken.
 36.  Ham var det, som førte dem ud,idet han gjorde Undere og Tegn i
      Ægyptens Land og i det røde Hav og i Ørkenen i fyrretyve År.
 37.  Han er den Moses, som sagde til Israels Børn: "En Profet skal
      Gud oprejse eder af eders Brødre ligesom mig."
 38.  Han er den, som i Menigheden i Ørkenen færdedes med Engelen, der
      talte til ham på Sinai Bjerg, og med vore Fædre; den, som modtog
      levende Ord at give os;
 39.  hvem vore Fædre ikke vilde adlyde, men de stødte ham fra sig og
      vendte sig med deres Hjerter til Ægypten, idet de sagde til
      Aron:
 40.  "Gør os Guder, som kunne gå foran os; thi vi vide ikke, hvad der
      er sket med denne Moses, som førte os ud af Ægyptens Land."
 41.  Og de gjorde en Kalv i de Dage og bragte Offer til Gudebilledet
      og frydede sig ved deres Hænders Gerninger.
 42.  Men Gud vendte sig fra dem og gav dem hen til at tjene Himmelens
      Hær, som der er skrevet i Profeternes Bog: "Have I vel, Israels
      Hus!  bragt mig Slagtofre og andre Ofre i fyrretyve År i
      Ørkenen?
 43.  Og I bare Moloks Telt og Guden Remfans Stjerne, de Billeder, som
      I havde gjort for at tilbede dem; og jeg vil flytte eder bort
      hinsides Babylon."
 44.  Vore Fædre i Ørkenen havde Vidnesbyrdets Tabernakel, således som
      han, der talte til Moses, havde befalet at gøre det efter det
      Forbillede, som han havde set.
 45.  Dette toge også vore Fædre i Arv og bragte det under Josva ind i
      Landet, som Hedningerne besade, hvilke Gud fordrev fra vore
      Fædres Åsyn indtil Davids Dage,
 46.  som vandt Nåde for Gud og bad om at måtte finde en Bolig for
      Jakobs Gud.
 47.  Men Salomon byggede ham et Hus.
 48.  Dog, den Højeste bor ikke i Huse gjorte med Hænder, som Profeten
      siger:
 49.  "Himmelen er min Trone, og Jorden mine Fødders Skammel, hvad Hus
      ville I bygge mig? siger Herren, eller hvilket er min Hviles
      Sted?
 50.  Har ikke min Hånd gjort alt dette?"
 51.  I hårde Halse og uomskårne på Hjerter og Øren! I stå altid den
      Helligånd imod; som eders Fædre, således også I.
 52.  Hvem af Profeterne er der, som eders Fædre ikke have forfulgt?
      og de ihjelsloge dem, som forud forkyndte om den retfærdiges
      Komme, hvis Forrædere og Mordere I nu ere blevne,
 53.  I, som modtoge Loven under Engles Besørgelse og have ikke holdt
      den!"

 54.  Men da de hørte dette, skar det dem i deres Hjerter, og de bede
      Tænderne sammen imod ham.
 55.  Men som han var fuld af den Helligånd, stirrede han op imod
      Himmelen og så Guds Herlighed og Jesus stående ved Guds højre
      Hånd.
 56.  Og han sagde: "Se, jeg ser Himlene åbnede og Menneskesønnen
      stående ved Guds højre Hånd."
 57.  Men de råbte med høj Røst og holdt for deres Øren og stormede
      endrægtigt ind på ham.
 58.  Og de stødte ham ud uden for Staden og stenede ham. Og Vidnerne
      lagde deres Klæder af ved en ung Mands Fødder, som hed Saulus.
 59.  Og de stenede Stefanus, som bad og sagde: "Herre Jesus, tag imod
      min Ånd!"
 60.  Men han faldt på Knæ og råbte med høj Røst: "Herre, tilregn dem
      ikke denne Synd!" Og som han sagde dette, sov han hen.  (Kap.8)
      1 Men Saulus fandt Behag i hans Mord.

Apostelenes gerninger 8

  1.  Og på den Dag udbrød der en stor Forfølgelse imod Menigheden i
      Jerusalem, og de adspredtes alle over Judæas og Samarias Egne,
      undtagen Apostlene.
  2.  Men gudfrygtige Mænd begravede Stefanus og holdt en stor Veklage
      over ham.
  3.  Men Saulus plagede Menigheden og gik ind i Husene og trak både
      Mænd og Kvinder frem og lod dem sætte i Fængsel.
  4.  Imidlertid gik de, som bleve adspredte, omkring og forkyndte
      Evangeliets Ord.

  5.  Da kom Filip til Byen Samaria og prædikede Kristus for dem.
  6.  Og Skarerne gave endrægtigt Agt på det, som blev sagt af Filip,
      idet de hørte og så de Tegn, som han gjorde.
  7.  Thi der var mange, som havde urene Ånder, og af hvem disse fore
      ud, råbende med høj Røst; og mange værkbrudne og lamme bleve
      helbredte.
  8.  Og der blev en stor Glæde i denne By.
  9.  Men en Mand, ved Navn Simon, var i Forvejen i Byen og drev
      Trolddom og satte Samarias Folk i Forbavselse, idet han udgav
      sig selv for at være noget stort.
 10.  På ham gave alle Agt, små og store, og sagde: "Det er ham, som
      man kalder Guds store Kraft."
 11.  Men de gave Agt på ham, fordi han i lang Tid havde sat dem i
      Forbavselse ved sine Trolddomskunster.
 12.  Men da de troede Filip, som forkyndte Evangeliet om Guds Rige og
      Jesu Kristi Navn, lode de sig døbe, både Mænd og Kvinder.
 13.  Men Simon troede også selv, og efter at være døbt holdt han sig
      nær til Filip; og da han så Tegn og store, kraftige Gerninger
      ske, forbavsedes han højligt.
 14.  Men da Apostlene i Jerusalem hørte, at Samaria havde taget imod
      Guds Ord, sendte de Peter og Johannes til dem,
 15.  og da disse vare komne derned, bade de for dem om, at de måtte
      få den Helligånd;
 16.  thi den var endnu ikke falden på nogen af dem, men de vare blot
      døbte til den Herres Jesu Navn.
 17.  Da lagde de Hænderne på dem, og de fik den Helligånd.
 18.  Men da Simon så, at den Helligånd blev given ved Apostlenes
      Håndspålæggelse, bragte han dem Penge og sagde:
 19.  "Giver også mig denne Magt, at, hvem jeg lægger Hænderne på, han
      må få den Helligånd."
 20.  Men Peter sagde til ham: "Gid dit Sølv må gå til Grunde tillige
      med dig, fordi du mente at kunne erhverve Guds Gave for Penge.
 21.  Du har ikke Del eller Lod i dette Ord; thi dit Hjerte er ikke
      ret for Gud.
 22.  Omvend dig derfor fra denne din Ondskab og bed Herren, om dog
      dit Hjertes Påfund måtte forlades dig.
 23.  Thi jeg ser, at du er stedt i Bitterheds Galde og Uretfærdigheds
      Lænke."
 24.  Men Simon svarede og sagde: "Beder I for mig til Herren, for at
      intet af det, som I have sagt, skal komme over mig."
 25.  Men da de havde vidnet og talt Herrens Ord, vendte de tilbage
      til Jerusalem, og de forkyndte Evangeliet i mange af
      Samaritanernes Landsbyer.

 26.  Men en Herrens Engel talte til Filip og sagde: "Stå op og gå mod
      Syd på den Vej, som går ned fra Jerusalem til Gaza; den er øde."
 27.  Og han stod op og gik. Og se, der var en Æthioper, en Hofmand,
      en mægtig Mand hos Kandake, Æthiopernes Dronning, som var sat
      over alle hendes Skatte; han var kommen til Jerusalem for at
      tilbede.
 28.  Og han var på Hjemvejen og sad på sin Vogn og læste Profeten
      Esajas.
 29.  Men Ånden sagde til Filip:"Gå hen og hold dig til denne Vogn!"
 30.  Og Filip løb derhen og hørte ham læse Profeten Esajas; og han
      sagde: "Forstår du også det, som du læser?"
 31.  Men han sagde: "Hvorledes skulde jeg kunne det, uden nogen
      vejleder mig?" Og han bad Filip stige op og sætte sig hos ham.
 32.  Men det Stykke af Skriften, som han læste, var dette: "Som et
      Får blev han ført til Slagtning, og som et Lam er stumt imod
      den, der klipper det, således oplader han ej sin Mund.
 33.  I Fornedrelsen blev hans Dom taget bort; hvem kan fortælle om
      hans Slægt, efterdi hans Liv borttages fra Jorden?"
 34.  Men Hofmanden talte til Filip og sagde: "Jeg beder dig, om hvem
      siger Profeten dette? om sig selv eller om en anden?"
 35.  Da oplod Filip sin Mund, og idet han begyndte fra dette
      Skriftsted, forkyndte han ham Evangeliet om Jesus.
 36.  Men som de droge frem ad Vejen, kom de til noget Vand; og
      Hofmanden siger: "Se, her er Vand, hvad hindrer mig fra at blive
      døbt?"  (37 Men Filip sagde: "Dersom du tror, af hele dit
      Hjerte, kan det ske." Men han svarede og sagde: "Jeg tror, at
      Jesus Kristus er Guds Søn.")
 38.  Og han bød, at Vognen skulde holde, og de stege begge ned i
      Vandet, både Filip og Hofmanden; og han døbte ham
 39.  Men da de stege op af Vandet, bortrykkede Herrens Ånd Filip, og
      Hofmanden så ham ikke mere; thi han drog sin Vej med Glæde.
 40.  Men Filip blev funden i Asdod, og han drog omkring og forkyndte
      Evangeliet i alle Byerne, indtil han kom fil Kæsarea.

Apostelenes gerninger 9

  1.  Men Saulus, som endnu fnøs med Trusel og Mord imod Herrens
      Disciple, gik til Ypperstepræsten
  2.  og bad ham om Breve til Damaskus til Synagogerne, for at han, om
      han fandt nogle, Mænd eller Kvinder, som holdt sig til Vejen,
      kunde føre dem bundne til Jerusalem.
  3.  Men da han var undervejs og nærmede sig til Damaskus, omstrålede
      et Lys fra Himmelen ham pludseligt.
  4.  Og han faldt til Jorden og hørte en Røst, som sagde til ham:
      "Saul!  Saul! hvorfor forfølger du mig?"
  5.  Og han sagde: "Hvem er du, Herre?" Men han svarede: "Jeg er
      Jesus, som du forfølger.
  6.  Men stå op og gå ind i Byen, og det skal siges dig, hvad du bør
      gøre."
  7.  Men de Mænd, som rejste med ham, stode målløse, da de vel hørte
      Røsten, men ikke så nogen.
  8.  Og Saulus rejste sig op fra Jorden; men da han oplod sine Øjne,
      så han intet. Men de ledte ham ved Hånden og førte ham ind i
      Damaskus.
  9.  Og han kunde i tre Dage ikke se, og han hverken spiste eller
      drak.
 10.  Men der var en Discipel i Damaskus, ved Navn Ananias, og Herren
      sagde til ham i et Syn: "Ananias!" Og han sagde: "Se, her er
      jeg, Herre!"
 11.  Og Herren sagde til ham: "Stå op, gå hen i den Gade, som kaldes
      den lige, og spørg i Judas's Hus efter en ved Navn Saulus fra
      Tarsus; thi se, han beder.
 12.  Og han har i et Syn set en Mand, ved Navn Ananias, komme ind og
      lægge Hænderne på ham, for at han skulde blive seende."
 13.  Men Ananias svarede: "Herre! jeg har hørt af mange om denne
      Mand, hvor meget ondt han har gjort dine hellige i Jerusalem.
 14.  Og her har han Fuldmagt fra Ypperstepræsterne til at binde alle
      dem, som påkalde dit Navn."
 15.  Men Herren sagde til ham: "Gå; thi denne er mig et udvalgt
      Redskab til at bære mit Navn frem både for Hedninger og Konger
      og Israels Børn;
 16.  thi jeg vil, vise ham hvor meget han bør lide for mit Navns
      Skyld."
 17.  Men Ananias gik hen og kom ind i Huset og lagde Hænderne på ham
      og sagde: "Saul, Broder! Herren har sendt mig, den Jesus, der
      viste sig for dig på Vejen, ad hvilken du kom, for at du skal
      blive seende igen og fyldes med den Helligånd."
 18.  Og straks faldt der ligesom Skæl fra hans Øjne, og han blev
      seende, og han stod op og blev døbt.
 19.  Og han fik Mad og kom til Kræfter. Men han blev nogle Dage hos
      Disciplene i Damaskus.

 20.  Og straks prædikede han i Synagogerne om Jesus, at han er Guds
      Søn.
 21.  Men alle, som hørte det, forbavsedes og sagde: "Er det ikke ham,
      som i Jerusalem forfulgte dem, der påkaldte dette Navn, og var
      kommen hertil for at føre dem bundne til Ypperstepræsterne?"
 22.  Men Saulus voksede i Kraft og gendrev Jøderne, som boede i
      Damaskus, idet han beviste, at denne er Kristus.
 23.  Men da nogle Dage vare forløbne, holdt Jøderne Råd om at slå ham
      ihjel.
 24.  Men Saulus fik deres Efterstræbelser at vide. Og de bevogtede
      endog Portene både Dag og Nat, for at de kunde slå ham ihjel.
 25.  Men hans Disciple toge ham ved Nattetid og bragte ham ud igennem
      Muren, idet de firede ham ned i en Kurv.
 26.  Men da han kom til Jerusalem, forsøgte han at holde sig til
      Disciplene; men de frygtede alle for ham, da de ikke troede, at
      han var en Discipel.
 27.  Men Barnabas tog sig af ham og førte ham til Apostlene; og han
      fortalte dem, hvorledes han havde set Herren på Vejen, og at han
      havde talt til ham, og hvorledes han i Damaskus havde vidnet
      frimodigt i Jesu Navn.
 28.  Og han gik ind og gik ud med dem i Jerusalem
 29.  og vidnede frimodigt i Herrens Navn. Og han talte og tvistedes
      med Hellenisterne; men de toge sig for at slå ham ihjel.
 30.  Men da Brødrene fik dette at vide, førte de ham ned til Kæsarea
      og sendte ham videre til Tarsus.

 31.  Så havde da Menigheden Fred over hele Judæa og Galilæa og
      Samaria, og den opbyggedes og vandrede i Herrens Frygt, og ved
      den Helligånds Formaning voksede den.
 32.  Men det skete, medens Peter drog omkring alle Vegne, at han også
      kom ned til de hellige, som boede i Lydda.
 33.  Der fandt han en Mand ved Navn Æneas, som havde ligget otte År
      til Sengs og var værkbruden.
 34.  Og Peter sagde til ham: "Æneas! Jesus Kristus helbreder dig; stå
      op, og red selv din Seng!" Og han stod straks op.
 35.  Og alle Beboere af Lydda og Saron så ham, og de omvendte sig til
      Herren.
 36.  Men i Joppe var der en Discipelinde ved Navn Tabitha, hvilket
      udlagt betyder Hind; hun var rig på gode Gerninger og gav mange
      Almisser.
 37.  Men det skete i de Dage, at hun blev syg og døde. Da toede de
      hende og lagde hende i Salen ovenpå.
 38.  Men efterdi Lydda var nær ved Joppe, udsendte Disciplene, da de
      hørte, at Peter var der, to Mænd til ham og bade ham: "Kom uden
      Tøven over til os!"
 39.  Men Peter stod op og gik med dem. Og da han kom derhen, førte de
      ham op i Salen ovenpå, og alle Enkerne stode hos ham, græd og
      viste ham alle de Kjortler og Kapper, som "Hinden" havde
      forarbejdet, medens hun var hos dem.
 40.  Men Peter bød dem alle at gå ud, og han faldt på Knæ og bad; og
      han vendte sig til det døde Legeme og sagde: "Tabitha, stå op!"
      Men hun oplod sine Øjne, og da hun så Peter, satte hun sig op.
 41.  Men han gav hende Hånden og rejste hende op, og han kaldte på de
      hellige og Enkerne og fremstillede hende levende for dem.
 42.  Men det blev vitterligt over hele Joppe, og mange troede på
      Herren.
 43.  Og det skete, at han blev mange Dage i Joppe hos en vis Simon,
      en Garver.

Apostelenes gerninger 10

  1.  Men en Mand i Kæsarea ved Navn Konelius, en Høvedsmand ved den
      Afdeling, som kaldes den italienske,
  2.  en from Mand, der frygtede Gud tillige med hele sit Hus og gav
      Folket mange Almisser og altid bad til Gud,
  3.  han så klarlig i et Syn omtrent ved den niende Time på Dagen en
      Guds Engel, som kom ind til ham og sagde til ham: "Kornelius!"
  4.  Men han stirrede på ham og blev forfærdet og sagde: "Hvad er
      det, Herre?" Han sagde til ham: "Dine Bønner og dine Almisser
      ere opstegne til Ihukommelse for Gud.
  5.  Og send nu nogle Mænd til Joppe, og lad hente en vis Simon med
      Tilnavn Peter.
  6.  Han har Herberge hos en vis Simon, en Garver, hvis Hus er ved
      Havet."
  7.  Men da Engelen, som talte til ham, var gået bort, kaldte han to
      af sine Husfolk og en gudfrygtig Stridsmand af dem, som stadig
      vare om ham.
  8.  Og han fortalte dem det alt sammen og sendte dem til Joppe.
  9.  Men den næste Dag, da disse vare undervejs og nærmede sig til
      Byen, steg Peter op på Taget for at bede ved den sjette Time.
      10Og han blev meget hungrig og vilde have noget at spise; men
      medens de lavede det til, kom der en Henrykkelse over ham,
 11.  og han så Himmelen åbnet og noget, der dalede ned, ligesom en
      stor Dug, der ved de fire Hjørner sænkedes ned på Jorden;
 12.  og i denne var der alle Jordens firføddede Dyr og krybende Dyr
      og Himmelens Fugle.
 13.  Og en Røst lød til ham: "Stå op, Peter, slagt og spis!"
 14.  Men Peter sagde: "Ingenlunde, Herre! thi aldrig har jeg spist
      noget vanhelligt og urent."
 15.  Og atter for anden Gang lød der en Røst til ham: "Hvad Gud har
      renset, holde du ikke for vanhelligt!"
 16.  Og dette skete tre Gange, og straks blev dugen igen optagen til
      Himmelen.
 17.  Men medens Peter var tvivlrådig med sig selv om, hvad det Syn,
      som han havde set, måtte betyde, se, da havde de Mænd, som vare
      udsendte af Kornelius, opspurgt Simons Hus og stode for Porten.
 18.  Og de råbte og spurgte, om Simmon med Tilnavn Peter havde
      Herberge der.
 19.  Men idet Peter grublede over Synet, sagde Ånden til ham: "Se,
      der er tre Mænd, som søge efter dig;
 20.  men stå op, stig ned, og drag med dem uden at tvivle; thi det er
      mig, som har sendt dem."
 21.  Så steg Peter ned til Mændene og sagde: "Se, jeg er den, som I
      søge efter; hvad er Årsagen, hvorfor I ere komne?"
 22.  Men de sagde: "Høvedsmanden Kornelius, en retfærdig og
      gudfrygtig Mand, som har godt Vidnesbyrd af hele Jødernes Folk,
      har at en hellig Engel fået Befaling fra Gud til at lade dig
      hente til sit Hus og høre, hvad du har at sige."
 23.  Da kaldte han dem ind og gav dem Herberge. Men den næste Dag
      stod han op og drog bort med dem, og nogle af Brødrene fra Joppe
      droge med ham.
 24.  Og den følgende Dag kom de til Kæsarea. Men Kornelius ventede på
      dem og havde sammnenkaldt sine Frænder og nærmeste Venner.
 25.  Men da det nu skete, at Peter kom ind, gik Kornelius ham i Møde
      og faldt ned for hans Fødder og tilbad ham.
 26.  Men Peter rejste ham op og sagde: "Stå op! også jeg er selv et
      Menneske."
 27.  Og under Samtale med ham gik han ind og fandt mange samlede.
 28.  Og han sagde til dem: "I vide, hvor utilbørligt det er for en
      jødisk Mand at omgås med eller komne til nogen, som er af et
      fremmede Folk; men mig har Gud vist, at jeg ikke skulde kalde
      noget Menneske vanhelligt eller urent.
 29.  Derfor kom jeg også uden Indvending, da jeg blev hentet; og jeg
      spørger eder da, af hvad Årsag I hentede mig?"
 30.  Og Kornelius sagde: "For fire Dage siden fastede jeg indtil
      denne Time, og ved den niende Time bad jeg i mit Hus; og se, en
      Mand stod for mig i et strålende Klædebon,
 31.  og han sagde: Kornelius! din Bøn er hørt, og dine Almisser ere
      ihukommede for Gud.
 32.  Send derfor Bud til Joppe og lad Simon med Tilnavn Peter kalde,
      til dig; han har Herberge i Garveren Simons Hus ved Havet; han
      skal tale til dig, når han kommer.
 33.  Derfor sendte jeg straks Bud til dig, og du gjorde vel i at
      komme.  Nu ere vi derfor alle til Stede for Guds Åsyn for at
      høre alt, hvad der er dig befalet af Herren."
 34.  Men Peter oplod Munden og sagde: "Jeg forstår i Sandhed, at Gud
      ikke anser Personer;
 35.  men i hvert Folk er den, som frygter ham og gør Retfærdighed,
      velkommen for ham;
 36.  det Ord, som han sendte til Israels Børn, da han forkyndte Fred
      ved Jesus Kristus: han er alles Herre.
 37.  I kende det, som er udgået over hele Judæa, idet det begyndte
      fra Galilæa, efter den Dåb, som Johannes prædikede,
 38.  det om Jesus fra Nazareth, hvorledes Gud salvede ham med den
      Helligånd og Kraft, han, som drog omkring og gjorde vel og
      helbredte alle, som vare overvældede af Djævelen; thi Gud var
      med ham;
 39.  og vi ere Vidner om alt det, som han har gjort både i Jødernes
      Land og i Jerusalem, han, som de også sloge ihjel, idet de
      hængte ham på et Træ.
 40.  Ham oprejste Gud på den tredje dag og gav ham at åbenbares,
 41.  ikke for hele Folket, men for de Vidner, som vare forud udvalgte
      af Gud, for os, som spiste og drak med ham, efter at han var
      opstanden fra de døde.
 42.  Og han har påbudt os at prædike for Folket og at vidne, at han
      er den af Gud bestemte Dommer over levende og døde.
 43.  Ham give alle Profeterne det Vidnesbyrd, at enhver, som tror på
      ham, skal få Syndernes Forladelse ved hans Navn."
 44.  Medens Peter endnu talte disse Ord, faldt den Helligånd på alle
      dem, som hørte Ordet.
 45.  Og de troende af Omskærelsen, så mange, som vare komne med
      Peter, bleve meget forbavsede over, af den Helligånds Gave var
      bleven udgydt også over Hedningerne;
 46.  thi de hørte dem tale i Tunger og ophøje Gud.
 47.  Da svarede Peter: "Mon nogen kan formene disse Vandet; så de
      ikke skulde døbes, de, som dog havde fået den Helligånd lige så
      vel som vi?"
 48.  Og han befalede, af de skulde døbes i Jesu Kristi Navn. Da bade
      de ham om at blive der nogle Dage.

Apostelenes gerninger 11

  1.  Men Apostlene og de Brødre, som vare rundt om i Judæa, hørte, at
      også Hedningerne havde modtaget Guds Ord.
  2.  Og da Peter kom op til Jerusalem, tvistedes de af Omskærelsen
      med ham og sagde:
  3.  "Du er gået ind til uomskårne Mænd og har spist med dem."
  4.  Men Peter begyndte og forklarede dem det i Sammenhæng og sagde:
  5.  "Jeg var i Byen Joppe og bad; og jeg så i en Henrykkelse et Syn,
      noget, der dalede ned, ligesom en stor Dug, der ved de fire
      Hjørner sænkedes ned fra Himmelen, og den kom lige hen til mig.
  6.  Jeg stirrede på den og betragtede den og så da Jordens
      firføddede Dyr og vilde Dyr og krybende Dyr og Himmelens Fugle.
  7.  Og jeg hørte også en Røst, som sagde til mig: Stå op, Peter,
      slagt og spis!
  8.  Men jeg sagde: Ingenlunde, Herre! thi aldrig kom noget
      vanhelligt eller urent i min Mund.
  9.  Men en Røst svarede anden Gang fra Himmelen: Hvad Gud har
      renset, holde du ikke for vanhelligt!
 10.  Og dette skete tre Gange; så blev det igen alt sammen draget op
      til Himmelen.
 11.  Og se, i det samme stode tre Mænd ved det Hus, i hvilket jeg
      var, som vare udsendte til mig fra Kæsarea.
 12.  Men Ånden sagde til mig, at jeg skulde gå med dem uden at gøre
      Forskel. Men også disse seks Brødre droge med mig, og vi gik ind
      i Mandens Hus.
 13.  Og han fortalte os, hvorledes han havde set Engelen stå i hans
      Hus og sige: Send Bud til Joppe og lad Simon med Tilnavn Peter
      hente!
 14.  Han skal tale Ord til dig, ved hvilke du og hele dit Hus skal
      frelses.
 15.  Men idet jeg begyndte at tale, faldt den Helligånd på dem
      ligesom også på os i Begyndelsen.
 16.  Og jeg kom Herrens Ord i Hu, hvorledes han sagde: Johannes døbte
      med Vand, men I skulle døbes med den Helligånd.
 17.  Når altså Gud gav dem lige Gave med os, da de troede på den
      Herre Jesus Kristus,hvem var da jeg, at jeg skulde kunne hindre
      Gud?"
 18.  Men da de hørte dette, bleve de rolige, og de priste Gud og
      sagde: "Så har Gud også givet Hedningerne Omvendelsen til Liv."

 19.  De, som nu vare blevne adspredte på Grund af den Trængsel, som
      opstod i Anledning af Stefanus, vandrede om lige til Fønikien og
      Kypern og Antiokia, og de talte ikke Ordet til nogen uden til
      Jøder alene.
 20.  Men iblandt dem var der nogle Mænd fra Kypern og Kyrene, som kom
      til Antiokia og talte også til Grækerne og forkyndte Evangeliet
      om den Herre Jesus.
 21.  Og Herrens Hånd var med dem, og et stort Antal blev troende og
      omvendte sig til Herren.
 22.  Men Rygtet om dem kom Menigheden i Jerusalem for Øre, og de
      sendte Barnabas ud til Antiokia.
 23.  Da han nu kom derhen og så Guds Nåde, glædede han sig og
      formanede alle til med Hjertets Forsæt at blive ved Herren.
 24.  Thi han var en god Mand og fuld af den Helligånd og Tro. Og en,
      stor Skare blev ført til Herren.
 25.  Men han drog ud til Tarsus for at opsøge Saulus; og da han fandt
      ham, førte han ham til Antiokia.
 26.  Og det skete, at de endog et helt År igennem færdedes sammen i
      Menigheden og lærte en stor Skare, og at Disciplene først i
      Antiokia bleve kaldte Kristne.

 27.  Men i disse Dage kom der Profeter ned fra Jerusalem til Antiokia
 28.  Og en af dem, ved Navn Agabus, stod op og tilkendegav ved Ånden,
      at der skulde komme en stor Hungersnød over hele Verden, hvilken
      også kom under Klaudius.
 29.  Men Disciplene besluttede at sende, hver efter sin Evne, noget
      til Hjælp for Brødrene, som boede i Judæa;
 30.  hvilket de også gjorde, og de sendte det til de Ældste ved
      Barnabas og Saulus's Hånd.

Apostelenes gerninger 12

  1.  På den Tid lagde Kong Herodes den for at mishandle dem,
  2.  og Jakob, Johannes's Broder, lod han henrette med Sværd.
  3.  Og da han så, at det behagede Jøderne, gik han videre og lod
      også Peter gribe. Det var de usyrede Brøds Dage.
  4.  Og da han havde grebet ham, satte han ham i Fængsel og overgav
      ham til at bevogtes af fire Vagtskifter, hvert på fire
      Stridsmænd, da han efter Påsken vilde føre ham frem for Folket.
  5.  Så blev da Peter bevogtet i Fængselet; men der blev af
      Menigheden holdt inderlig Bøn til Gud for ham.
  6.  Men da Herodes vilde til at føre ham frem, sov Peter den Nat
      imellem to Stridsmænd, bunden med to Lænker, og Vagter foran
      Døren bevogtede Fængselet.
  7.  Og se, en Herrens Engel stod der, og et Lys strålede i
      Fangerummet, og han slog Peter i Siden og vækkede ham og sagde:
      "Stå op i Hast!" og Lænkerne faldt ham af Hænderne.
  8.  Og Engelen sagde til ham: "Bind op om dig, og bind dine Sandaler
      på!" Og han gjorde så. Og han siger til ham: "Kast din Kappe om
      dig, og følg mig!"
  9.  Og han gik ud og fulgte ham, og han vidste ikke, at det, som
      skete ved Engelen, var virkeligt, men mente, at han så et Syn.
 10.  Men de gik igennem den første og den anden Vagt og kom til den
      Jernport, som førte ud til Staden; denne åbnede sig for dem af
      sig selv, og de kom ud og gik en Gade frem, og straks skiltes
      Engelen fra ham.
 11.  Og da Peter kom til sig selv, sagde han: "Nu ved jeg i Sandhed,
      at Herren udsendte sin Engel og udfriede mig af Herodes's Hånd
      og al det jødiske Folks Forventning."
 12.  Og da han havde besindet sig, gik han til Marias Hus, hun, som
      var Moder til Johannes, med Tilnavn Markus, hvor mange vare
      forsamlede og bade.
 13.  Men da han bankede på Døren til Portrummet, kom der en Pige ved
      Navn Rode for at høre efter.
 14.  Og da hun kendte Peters Røst, lod hun af Glæde være at åbne
      Porten, men løb ind og forkyndte dem, at Peter stod uden for
      Porten.
 15.  Da sagde de til hende: "Du raser." Men hun stod fast på, at det
      var således. Men de sagde: "Det er hans Engel."
 16.  Men Peter blev ved at banke på, og da de lukkede op, så de ham
      og bleve forbavsede.
 17.  Da vinkede han til dem med Hånden, at de skulde tie, og fortalte
      dem, hvorledes Herren havde ført ham ud af Fængselet, og han
      sagde: "Forkynder Jakob og Brødrene dette!" Og han gik ud og
      drog til et andet Sted.

 18.  Men da det blev Dag, var der ikke liden Uro iblandt
      Stridsmændene over, hvad der var blevet af Peter.
 19.  Men da Herodes søgte ham og ikke fandt ham, forhørte han Vagten
      og befalede, at de skulde henrettes. Og han drog ned fra Judæa
      til Kæsarea og opholdt sig der.
 20.  Men han lå i Strid med Tyrierne og Sidonierne. Men de kom
      endrægtigt til ham og fik Blastus, Kongens Kammerherre, på deres
      Side og bade om Fred, fordi deres Land fik Næringsmidler
      tilførte fra Kongens Land.
 21.  Men på en fastsat Dag iførte Herodes sig en Kongedragt og satte
      sig på Tronen og holdt en Tale til dem,
 22.  Og Folket råbte til ham: "DeterGudsRøstog ikke et Menneskes."
 23.  Men straks slog en Herrens Engel ham, fordi han ikke gav Gud
      Æren; og han blev fortæret af Orme og udåndede.
 24.  Men Guds Ord havde Fremgang og udbredtes.
 25.  Og Barnabas og Saulus vendte tilbage fra Jerusalem efter at have
      fuldført deres Ærinde, og de havde Johannes, med Tilnavn Markus,
      med sig.

Apostelenes gerninger 13

  1.  Men i Antiokia, i den derværende Menighed, var der Profeter og
      Lærere, nemlig Barnabas og Simeon, med Tilnavn Niger, og
      Kyrenæeren Lukius og Manaen, en Fosterbroder af Fjerdingsfyrsten
      Herodes, og Saulus.
  2.  Medens de nu holdt Gudstjeneste og fastede, sagde den Helligånd:
      "Udtager mig Barnabas og Saulus til den Gerning, hvortil jeg har
      kaldet dem."
  3.  Da fastede de og bade og lagde Hænderne på dem og lode dem fare.
  4.  Da de nu således vare udsendte af den Helligånd, droge de ned
      til Seleukia og sejlede derfra til Kypern.
  5.  Og da de vare komne til Salamis, forkyndte de Guds Ord i
      Jødernes Synagoger; men de havde også Johannes til Medhjælper.
  6.  Og da de vare dragne igennem hele Øen indtil Pafus, fandt de en
      Troldkarl, en falsk Profet, en Jøde, hvis Navn var Barjesus.
  7.  Han var hos Statholderen Sergius Paulus, en forstandig
      Mand. Denne kaldte Barnabas og Saulus til sig og attråede at
      høre Guds Ord.
  8.  Men Elimas, Troldkarlen, (thi dette betyder hans Navn), stod dem
      imod og søgte at vende Statholderen bort fra Troen.
  9.  Men Saulus, som også kaldes Paulus, blev fyldt med den
      Helligånd, så fast på ham og sagde:
 10.  "O, du Djævelens Barn, fuld af al Svig og al Underfundighed, du
      Fjende af al Retfærdighed! vil du ikke holde op med at forvende
      Herrens de lige Veje?
 11.  Og nu se, Herrens Hånd er over dig, og du skal blive blind og
      til en Tid ikke se Solen." Men straks faldt der Mulm og Mørke
      over ham, og han gik omkring og søgte efter nogen, som kunde
      lede ham.
 12.  Da Statholderen så det, som var sket, troede han, slagen af
      Forundring over Herrens Lære.

 13.  Paulus og de, som vare med ham, sejlede da ud fra Pafus og kom
      til Perge i Pamfylien. Men Johannes skiltes fra dem og vendte
      tilbage til Jerusalem.
 14.  Men de droge videre fra Perge og kom til Antiokia i Pisidien og
      gik ind i Synagogen på Sabbatsdagen og satte sig.
 15.  Men efter Forelæsningen af Loven og Profeterne sendte
      Synagogeforstanderne Bud hen til dem og lode sige: "I Mænd,
      Brødre!  have I noget Formaningsord til Folket, da siger frem!"
 16.  Men Paulus stod op og slog til Lyd med Hånden og sagde: "I
      israelitiske Mænd og I, som frygte Gud, hører til!  17. Dette
      Folks, Israels Gud udvalgte vore Fædre og ophøjede Folket i
      Udlændigheden i Ægyptens Land og førte dem derfra med løftet
      Arm.
 18.  Og omtrent fyrretyve År tålte han deres Færd i Ørkenen.
 19.  Og han udryddede syv Folk i Kanåns Land og fordelte disses Land
      iblandt dem,
 20.  og derefter i omtrent fire Hundrede og halvtredsindstyve År gav
      han dem Dommere indtil Profeten Samuel.
 21.  Og derefter bade de om en Konge; og Gud gav dem Saul, Kis's Søn,
      en Mand af Benjamins Stamme, i fyrretyve År.
 22.  Og da han havde taget ham bort, oprejste han dem David til
      Konge, om hvem han også vidnede, og sagde: "Jeg har fundet
      David, Isajs Søn, en Mand efter mit Hjerte, som skal gøre al min
      Villie."
 23.  Af dennes Sæd bragte Gud efter Forjættelsen Israel en Frelser,
      Jesus,
 24.  efter at Johannes forud for hans Fremtræden havde prædiket
      Omvendelses-Dåb for hele Israels Folk.
 25.  Men da Johannes var ved at fuldende sit Løb, sagde han: "Hvad
      anse I mig for at være? Mig er det ikke; men se, der kommer en
      efter mig, hvis Sko jeg ikke er værdig at løse."
 26.  I Mænd, Brødre, Sønner af Abrahams Slægt, og de iblandt eder,
      som frygte Gud! Til os er Ordet om denne Frelse sendt.
 27.  Thi de, som bo i Jerusalem, og deres Rådsherrer kendte ham ikke;
      de dømte ham og opfyldte derved Profeternes Ord, som forelæses
      hver Sabbat.
 28.  Og om end de ingen Dødsskyld fandt hos ham, bade de dog Pilatus,
      at han måtte blive slået ihjel.
 29.  Men da de havde fuldbragt alle Ting, som ere skrevne om ham,
      toge de ham ned af Træet og lagde ham i en Grav.
 30.  Men Gud oprejste ham fra de døde,
 31.  og han blev set i flere Dage af dem, som vare gåede med ham op
      fra Galilæa til Jerusalem, dem, som nu ere hans Vidner for
      Folket.
 32.  Og vi forkynde eder den Forjættelse, som blev given til Fædrene,
      at Gud har opfyldt denne for os, deres Børn, idet han oprejste
      Jesus;
 33.  som der også er skrevet i den anden Salme: "Du er min Søn, jeg
      har født dig i Dag."
 34.  Men at han har oprejst ham fra de døde, så at han ikke mere skal
      vende tilbage til Forrådnelse, derom har han sagt således: "Jeg
      vil give eder Davids hellige Forjættelser, de trofaste."
 35.  Thi han siger også i en anden Salme: "Du skal ikke tilstede din
      hellige at se Forrådnelse."
 36.  David sov jo hen, da han i sin Livstid havde tjent Guds
      Rådslutning, og han blev henlagt hos sine Fædre og så
      Forrådnelse;
 37.  men den, som Gud oprejste, så ikke Forrådnelse.
 38.  Så være det eder vitterligt, I Mænd, Brødre! at ved ham
      forkyndes der eder Syndernes Forladelse;
 39.  og fra alt, hvorfra I ikke kunde retfærdiggøres ved Mose Lov,
      retfærdiggøres ved ham enhver, som tror.
 40.  Ser nu til, at ikke det, som er sagt ved Profeterne, kommer over
      eder:
 41.  "Ser, I Foragtere, og forundrer eder og bliver til intet; thi en
      Gerning gør jeg i eders Dage, en Gerning, som I ikke vilde tro,
      dersom nogen fortalte eder den."
 42.  Men da de gik ud, bad man dem om, at disse Ord måtte blive talte
      til dem på den følgende Sabbat.
 43.  Men da Forsamlingen var opløst, fulgte mange af Jøderne og af de
      gudfrygtige Proselyter Paulus og Barnabas, som talte til dem og
      formanede dem til at blive fast ved Guds Nåde.

 44.  Men på den følgende Sabbat forsamledes næsten hele Byen for at
      høre Guds Ord.
 45.  Men da Jøderne så Skarerne, bleve de fulde af Nidkærhed og
      modsagde det, som blev talt af Paulus, ja, både sagde imod og
      spottede.
 46.  Men Paulus og Barnabas talte frit ud og sagde: "Det var
      nødvendigt, at Guds Ord først skulde tales til eder; men efterdi
      I støde det fra eder og ikke agte eder selv værdige til det
      evige Liv, se, så vende vi os til Hedningerne.
 47.  Thi således har Herren befalet os: "Jeg har sat dig til
      Hedningers Lys, for at du skal være til Frelse lige ud til
      Jordens Ende."
 48.  Men da Hedningerne hørte dette, bleve de glade og priste Herrens
      Ord, og de troede, så mange, som vare bestemte til evigt Liv,
 49.  og Herrens Ord udbredtes over hele Landet.
 50.  Men Jøderne ophidsede de fornemme gudfrygtige Kvinder og de
      første Mænd i Byen; og de vakte en Forfølgelse imod Paulus og
      Barnabas og joge dem ud fra deres Grænser.
 51.  Men de rystede Støvet af deres Fødder imod dem og droge til
      Ikonium.
 52.  Men Disciplene bleve fyldte med Glæde og den Helligånd.

Apostelenes gerninger 14

  1.  Men det skete i Ikonium, at de sammen gik ind i Jødernes
      Synagoge og talte således, at en stor Mængde,både af Jøder og
      Grækere, troede.
  2.  Men de Jøder, som vare genstridige, ophidsede Hedningernes Sind
      og satte ondt i dem imod Brødrene.
  3.  De opholdt sig nu en Tid lang der og talte med Frimodighed i
      Herren, som gav sin Nådes Ord Vidnesbyrd, idet han lod Tegn og
      Undere ske ved deres Hænder.
  4.  Men Mængden i Byen blev uenig, og nogle holdt med Jøderne, andre
      med Apostlene.

  5.  Men da der blev et Opløb, både af Hedningerne og Jøderne med
      samt deres Rådsherrer, for at mishandle og stene dem,
  6.  og de fik dette at vide, flygtede de bort til Byerne i
      Lykaonien, Lystra og Derbe, og til det omliggende Land,
  7.  og der forkyndte de Evangeliet.
  8.  Og i Lystra sad der en Mand, som var kraftesløs i Fødderne, lam
      fra Moders Liv, og han havde aldrig gået.
  9.  Han hørte Paulus tale; og da denne fæstede Øjet på ham og så, at
      han havde Tro til at frelses, sagde han med høj Røst:
 10.  "Stå ret op på dine Fødder!" Og han sprang op og gik omkring.
 11.  Men da Skarerne så, hvad Paulus havde gjort, opløftede de deres
      Røst og sagde på Lykaonisk: "Guderne ere i menneskelig Skikkelse
      stegne ned til os."
 12.  Og de kaldte Barnabas Zens, men Paulus Hermes, fordi han var
      den, som førte Ordet.
 13.  Men Præsten ved Zenstemplet, som var uden for Byen, bragte Tyre
      og Kranse hen til Portene og vilde ofre tillige med Skarerne.
 14.  Men da Apostlene, Barnabas og Paulus, hørte dette, sønderreve de
      deres Klæder og sprang ind i Skaren,
 15.  råbte og sagde: "I Mænd! hvorfor gøre I dette? Vi ere også
      Mennesker, lige Kår undergivne med eder, og vi forkynde eder
      Evangeliet om at vende om fra disse tomme Ting til den levende
      Gud, som har gjort Himmelen og Jorden og Havet og alt, hvad der
      er i dem;
 16.  han, som i de forbigangne Tider lod alle Hedningerne vandre
      deres egne Veje,
 17.  ihvorvel han ikke lod sig selv være uden Vidnesbyrd, idet han
      gjorde godt og gav eder Regn og frugtbare Tider fra Himmelen og
      mættede eders Hjerter med Føde og Glæde."
 18.  Og det var med Nød og næppe, at de ved at sige dette afholdt
      Skarerne fra at ofre til dem.
 19.  Men der kom Jøder til fra Antiokia og Ikonium, og de overtalte
      Skarerne og stenede Paulus og slæbte ham uden for Byen i den
      Tro, at han var død.
 20.  Men da Disciplene omringede ham, stod han op og gik ind i
      Byen. Og den næste Dag gik han med Barnabas bort til Derbe.

 21.  Og da de havde forkyndt Evangeliet i denne By og vundet mange
      Disciple, vendte de tilbage til Lystra og Ikonium og Antiokia
 22.  og styrkede Disciplenes Sjæle og påmindede dem om at blive i
      Troen og om, at vi må igennem mange Trængsler indgå i Guds Rige.
 23.  Men efter at de i hver Menighed havde udvalgt Ældste for dem,
      overgave de dem under Bøn og Faste til Herren, hvem de havde
      givet deres Tro.
 24.  Og de droge igennem Pisidien og kom til Pamfylien.
 25.  Og da de havde talt Ordet i Perge, droge de ned til Attalia.
 26.  Og derfra sejlede de til Antiokia, hvorfra de vare blevne
      overgivne til Guds Nåde til den Gerning, som de havde fuldbragt.
 27.  Men da de kom derhen og havde forsamlet Menigheden, forkyndte
      de, hvor store Ting Gud havde gjort med dem, og at han havde
      åbnet en Troens Dør for Hedningerne.
 28.  Men de opholdt sig en ikke liden Tid sammen med Disciplene.

Apostelenes gerninger 15

  1.  Og der kom nogle ned fra Judæa, som lærte Brødrene: "Dersom I
      ikke lade eder omskære efter Mose Skik, kunne I ikke blive
      frelste."
  2.  Da nu Paulus og Barnabas kom i en ikke ringe Splid og Strid med
      dem, så besluttede man, at Paulus og Barnabas og nogle andre af
      dem skulde drage op til Jerusalem til Apostlene og de Ældste i
      Anledning af dette Spørgsmål.
  3.  Disse bleve da sendte af Sted af Menigheden og droge igennem
      Fønikien og Samaria og fortalte om Hedningernes Omvendelse, og
      de gjorde alle Brødrene stor Glæde.
  4.  Men da de kom til Jerusalem, bleve de modtagne af Menigheden og
      Apostlene og de Ældste, og de kundgjorde, hvor store Ting Gud
      havde gjort med dem.
  5.  Men nogle af Farisæernes Parti, som vare blevne troende, stode
      op og sagde: "Man bør omskære dem og befale dem at holde Mose
      Lov."
  6.  Men Apostlene og de Ældste forsamlede sig for at overlægge denne
      Sag.
  7.  Men da man havde tvistet meget herom, stod Peter op og sagde til
      dem: "I Mænd, Brødre! I vide, at for lang Tid siden gjorde Gud
      det Valg iblandt eder, at Hedningerne ved min Mund skulde høre
      Evangeliets Ord og tro.
  8.  Og Gud, som kender Hjerterne, gav dem Vidnesbyrd ved at give dem
      den Helligånd lige så vel som os.
  9.  Og han gjorde ingen Forskel imellem os og dem, idet han ved
      Troen rensede deres Hjerter.
 10.  Hvorfor friste I da nu Gud, så I lægge et Åg på Disciplenes
      Nakke, som hverken vore Fædre eller vi have formået at bære?
 11.  Men vi tro, at vi bliver frelste ved den Herres Jesu Nåde på
      samme Måde som også de."
 12.  Men hele Mængden tav og de hørte Barnabas og Paulus fortælle,
      hvor store Tegn og Undere Gud havde gjort iblandt Hedningerne
      ved dem.
 13.  Men da de havde hørt op at tale, tog Jakob til Orde og sagde: "I
      Mænd, Brødre, hører mig!"
 14.  Simon har fortalt, hvorledes Gud først drog Omsorg for at tage
      ud af Hedninger et Folk for sit Navn.
 15.  Og dermed stemme Profeternes Tale overens, som der er skrevet:
 16.  "Derefter vil jeg vende tilbage og atter opbygge Davids faldne
      Hytte, og det nedrevne af den vil jeg atter opbygge og oprejse
      den igen,
 17.  for at de øvrige af Menneskene skulle søge Herren, og alle
      Hedningerne, over hvilke mit Navn er nævnet, siger Herren, som
      gør dette."
 18.  Gud kender fra Evighed af alle sine Gerninger.
 19.  Derfor mener jeg, at man ikke skal besvære dem af Hedningerne,
      som omvende sig til Gud,
 20.  men skrive til dem, at de skulle afholde sig fra Besmittelse med
      Afguderne og fra Utugt og fra det kvalte og fra Blodet.
 21.  Thi Moses har fra gammel Tid i hver By Mennesker, som prædike
      ham, idet han oplæses hver Sabbat i Synagogerne."
 22.  Da besluttede Apostelene og de Ældste tillige med hele
      Menigheden at udvælge nogle Mænd af deres Midte og sende dem til
      Antiokia tillige med Paulus og Barnabas, nemlig Judas, kaldet
      Barsabbas, og Silas, hvilke Mænd vare ansete iblandt Brødrene.
 23.  Og de skreve således med dem: "Apostlene og de Ældste og
      Brødrene hilse Brødrene af Hedningerne i Antiokia og Syrien og
      Kilikien.
 24.  Efterdi vi have hørt, at nogle, som ere komne fra os, have
      forvirret eder med Ord og voldt eders Sjæle Uro uden at have
      nogen Befaling fra os,
 25.  så have vi endrægtigt forsamlede, besluttet at udvælge nogle
      Mænd og sende dem til eder med vore elskelige Barnabas og
      Paulus,
 26.  Mænd, som have vovet deres Liv for vor Herres Jesu Kristi Navn.
 27.  Vi have derfor sendt Judas og Silas, der også mundtligt skulle
      forkynde det samme.
 28.  Thi det er den Helligånds Beslutning og vor, ingen videre Byrde
      at pålægge eder uden disse nødvendige Ting:
 29.  At I skulle afholde eder fra Afgudsofferkød og fra Blod og fra
      det kvalte og fra Utugt. Når I holde eder derfra, vil det gå
      eder godt.  Lever vel!"

 30.  Så lod man dem da fare, og de kom ned til Antiokia og forsamlede
      Mængden og overgave Brevet.
 31.  Men da de læste det, bleve de glade over Trøsten.
 32.  Og Judas og Silas, som også selv vare Profeter, opmuntrede
      Brødrene med megen Tale og styrkede dem.
 33.  Men da de havde opholdt sig der nogen Tid, lode Brødrene dem
      fare med Fred til dem, som havde udsendt dem.  (34 Men Silas
      besluttede at blive der.)
 35.  Men Paulus og Barnabas opholdt sig i Antiokia, hvor de tillige
      med mange andre lærte og forkyndte Herrens Ord.
 36.  Men efter nogen Tids Forløb sagde Paulus til Barnabas: "Lader os
      dog drage tilbage og besøge vore Brødre i hver By, hvor vi have
      forkyndt Herrens Ord, for at se, hvorledes det går dem."
 37.  Men Barnabas vilde også tage Johannes, kaldet Markus, med.
 38.  Men Paulus holdt for, at de ikke skulde tage den med, som havde
      forladt dem i Pamfylien og ikke havde fulgt med dem til
      Arbejdet.
 39.  Der blev da en heftig Strid, så at de skiltes fra hverandre, og
      Barnabas tog Markus med sig og sejlede til Kypern.
 40.  Men Paulus udvalgte Silas og drog ud, anbefalet af Brødrene til
      Herrens Nåde.
 41.  Men han rejste omkring i Syrien og Kilikien og styrkede
      Menighederne.

Apostelenes gerninger 16

  1.  Og han kom til Derbe og Lystra, og se, der var der en Discipel
      ved Navn Timotheus, Søn af en troende Jødinde og en græsk Fader.
  2.  Han havde godt Vidnesbyrd af Brødrene i Lystra og Ikonium.
  3.  Ham vilde Paulus have til at drage med sig, og han tog og omskar
      ham for Jødernes Skyld, som vare på disse Steder; thi de vidste
      alle, at hans Fader var en Græker.
  4.  Men alt som de droge igennem Byerne, overgave de dem de
      Bestemmelser at holde, som vare vedtagne af Apostlene og de
      Ældste i Jerusalem,
  5.  Så styrkedes Menighederne i Troen og voksede i Antal hver Dag.
  6.  Men de droge igennem Frygien og det galatiske Land, da de af den
      Helligånd vare blevne forhindrede i at tale Ordet i Asien.
  7.  Da de nu kom hen imod Mysien, forsøgte de at drage til
      Bithynien; og Jesu Ånd tilstedte dem det ikke.
  8.  De droge da Mysien forbi og kom ned til Troas.
  9.  Og et Syn viste sig om Natten for Paulus: En makedonisk Mand
      stod der og bad ham og sagde: "Kom over til Makedonien og hjælp
      os!"
 10.  Men da han havde set dette Syn, ønskede vi straks at drage over
      til Makedonien; thi vi sluttede, at Gud havde kaldt os derhen
      til at forkynde Evangeliet for dem.

 11.  Vi sejlede da ud fra Troas og styrede lige til Samothrake og den
      næste Dag til Neapolis
 12.  og derfra til Filippi, hvilken er den første By i den Del af
      Makedonien, en Koloni. I denne By opholdt vi os nogle Dage.
 13.  Og på Sabbatsdagen gik vi uden for Porten ved en Flod, hvor vi
      mente, at der var et Bedested", og vi satte os og talte til de
      Kvinder, som kom sammen.
 14.  Og en Kvinde ved Navn Lydia, en Purpurkræmmerske fra Byen
      Thyatira, en Kvinde, som frygtede Gud, hørte til, og hendes
      Hjerte oplod Herren til at give Agt på det, som blev talt af
      Paulus.
 15.  Men da hun og hendes Hus var blevet døbt, bad hun og sagde:
      "Dersom I agte mig for at være Herren tro, da kommer ind i mit
      Hus og bliver der!" Og hun nødte os.

 16.  Men det skete, da vi gik til Bedestedet, at en Pige mødte os,
      som havde en Spådomsånd og skaffede sine Herrer megen Vinding
      ved at spå.
 17.  Hun fulgte efter Paulus og os, råbte og sagde: "Disse Mennesker
      ere den højeste Guds Tjenere, som forkynde eder Frelsens Vej."
 18.  Og dette gjorde hun i mange Dage. Men Paulus blev fortrydelig
      derover, og han vendte sig og sagde til Ånden: "Jeg byder dig i
      Jesu Kristi Navn at fare ud af hende." Og den for ud i den samme
      Stund.
 19.  Men da hendes Herrer så, at deres Håb om Vinding var forsvundet,
      grebe de Paulus og Silas og slæbte dem hen på Torvet for
      Øvrigheden.
 20.  Og de førte dem til Høvedsmændene og sagde: "Disse Mennesker,
      som ere Jøder, forvirre aldeles vor By.
 21.  og de forkynde Skikke, som det ikke er tilladt os, der ere
      Romere, at antage eller øve."
 22.  Og Mængden rejste sig imod dem, og Høvedsmændene lode Klæderne
      rive af dem og befalede at piske dem.
 23.  Og da de havde givet dem mange Slag, kastede de dem i Fængsel og
      befalede Fangevogteren at holde dem sikkert bevogtede.
 24.  Da han havde fået sådan Befaling, kastede han dem i det inderste
      Fængsel og sluttede deres Fødder i Blokken.

 25.  Men ved Midnat bade Paulus og Silas og sang Lovsange til Gud; og
      Fangerne lyttede på dem.
 26.  Men pludseligt kom der et stort Jordskælv, så at Fængselets
      Grundvolde rystede, og straks åbnedes alle Dørene, og alles
      Lænker løstes.
 27.  Men Fangevogteren for op at Søvne, og da han så Fængselets Døre
      åbne, drog han et Sværd og vilde dræbe sig selv, da han mente,
      at Fangerne vare flygtede.
 28.  Men Paulus råbte med høj Røst og sagde: "Gør ikke dig selv noget
      ondt; thi vi ere her alle."
 29.  Men han forlangte Lys og sprang ind og faldt skælvende ned for
      Paulus og Silas.
 30.  Og han førte dem udenfor og sagde: "Herrer! hvad skal jeg gøre,
      for at jeg kan blive frelst?"
 31.  Men de sagde: "Tro på den Herre Jesus Kristus, så skal du blive
      frelst, du og dit Hus."
 32.  Og de talte Herrens Ord til ham og til alle dem, som vare i hans
      Hus.
 33.  Og han tog dem til sig i den samme Stund om Natten og aftoede
      deres Sår; og han selv og alle hans blev straks døbte.
 34.  Og han førte dem op i sit Hus og satte et Bord for dem og
      frydede sig over, at han med hele sit Hus var kommen til Troen
      på Gud.
 35.  Men da det var blevet Dag, sendte Høvedsmændene Bysvendene hen
      og sagde: "Løslad de Mænd!"
 36.  Men Fangevogteren meldte Paulus disse Ord: "Høvedsmændene have
      sendt Bud, at I skulle løslades; så drager nu ud og går bort med
      Fred!"
 37.  Men Paulus sagde til dem: "De have ladet os piske offentligt og
      uden Dom, os, som dog ere romerske Mænd, og kastet os i Fængsel,
      og nu jage de os hemmeligt bort! Nej, lad dem selv komme og føre
      os ud!"
 38.  Men Bysvendene meldte disse Ord til Høvedsmændene; og de bleve
      bange, da de hørte, at de vare Romere.
 39.  Og de kom og gave dem gode Ord, og de førte dem ud og bade dem
      at drage bort fra Byen.
 40.  Og de gik ud af Fængselet og gik ind til Lydia; og da de havde
      set Brødrene. formanede de dem og droge bort.

Apostelenes gerninger 17

  1.  Men de rejste igennem Amfipolis og Apollonia og kom til
      Thessalonika, hvor Jøderne havde en Synagoge.
  2.  Og efter sin Sædvane gik Paulus ind til dem, og på tre Sabbater
      samtalede han med dem ud fra Skrifterne,
  3.  idet han udlagde og forklarede, at Kristus måtte lide og opstå
      fra de døde, og han sagde: "Denne Jesus, som jeg forkynder eder,
      han er Kristus."
  4.  Og nogle af dem bleve overbeviste og sluttede sig til Paulus og
      Silas, og tillige en stor Mængde at de gudfrygtige Grækere og
      ikke få af de fornemste Kvinder.
  5.  Men Jøderne bleve nidkære og toge med sig nogle slette Mennesker
      af Lediggængerne på Torvet, rejste et Opløb og oprørte Byen; og
      de stormede Jasons Hus og søgte efter dem for at føre dem ud til
      Folket.
  6.  Men da de ikke fandt dem, trak de Jason og nogle Brødre for
      Byens Øvrighed og råbte: "Disse, som have bragt hele Verden i
      Oprør, ere også komne hid;
  7.  dem har Jason taget ind til sig; og alle disse handle imod
      Kejserens Befalinger og sige, at en anden er Konge, nemlig
      Jesus."
  8.  Og de satte Skræk i Mængden og Byens Øvrighed, som hørte det.
  9.  Og denne lod Jason og de andre stille Borgen og løslod dem.

 10.  Men Brødrene sendte straks om Natten både Paulus og Silas bort
      til Berøa; og da de vare komne dertil,gik de ind i Jødernes
      Synagoge.
 11.  Men disse vare mere velsindede end de i Thessalonika, de modtoge
      Ordet med al Redebonhed og ransagede daglig Skrifterne, om disse
      Ting forholdt sig således.
 12.  Så troede da mange af dem og ikke få af de fornemme græske
      Kvinder og Mænd.
 13.  Men da Jøderne i Thessalonika fik at vide, at Guds Ord blev
      forkyndt af Paulus også i Berøa, kom de og vakte også der Røre
      og Bevægelse iblandt Skarerne.

 14.  Men da sendte Brødrene straks Paulus bort, for at han skulde
      drage til Havet; men både Silas og Timotheus bleve der tilbage.
 15.  Og de, som ledsagede Paulus, førte ham lige til Athen; og efter
      at have fået det Bud med til Silas og Timotheus, at de snarest
      muligt skulde komme til ham, droge de bort.
 16.  Medens nu Paulus ventede på dem i Athen, harmedes hans Ånd i
      ham, da han så, at Byen var fuld af Afgudsbilleder.
 17.  Derfor talte han i Synagogen med Jøderne og de gudfrygtige og på
      Torvet hver Dag til dem, som han traf på.
 18.  Men også nogle af de epikuræiske og stoiske Filosoffer indlode
      sig i Ordstrid med ham; og nogle sagde: ""Hvad vil denne
      Ordgyder sige?"" men andre: ""Han synes at være en Forkynder af
      fremmede Guddomme;"" fordi han forkyndte Evangeliet om Jesus og
      Opstandelsen.
 19.  Og de toge ham og førte ham op på Areopagus og sagde: ""Kunne vi
      få at vide, hvad dette er for en ny Lære, som du taler om?
 20.  Thi du bringer os nogle fremmede Ting for Øren; derfor ville vi
      vide, hvad dette skal betyde.""
 21.  Men alle Atheniensere og de fremmede, som opholdt sig der, gave
      sig ikke Stunder til andet end at fortælle eller høre nyt.
 22.  Men Paulus stod frem midt på Areopagus og sagde: ""I
      athemiensiske Mænd! jeg ser, at I i alle Måder ere omhyggelige
      for eders Gudsdyrkelse.
 23.  Thi da jeg gik omkring og betragtede eders Helligdommen, fandt
      jeg også et Alter, på hvilket der var skrevet: ""For en ukendt
      Gud.""  Det, som I således dyrke uden at kende det, det
      forkynder jeg eder.
 24.  Gud, som har gjort Verden og alle Ting, som ere i den, han, som
      er Himmelens og Jordens Herre, bor ikke i Templer, gjorte med
      Hænder,
 25.  han tjenes ikke heller af Menneskers Hænder som en, der trænger
      til noget, efterdi han selv giver alle Liv og Ånde og alle Ting.
 26.  Og han har gjort, at hvert Folk iblandt Mennesker bor ud af eet
      Blod på hele Jordens Flade, idet han fastsatte bestemte Tider og
      Grænserne for deres Bolig,
 27.  for at de skulde søge Gud, om de dog kunde føle sig frem og
      finde ham, skønt han er ikke langt fra hver enkelt af os;
 28.  thi i ham leve og røres og ere vi, som også nogle af eders
      Digtere have sagt: Vi ere jo også hans Slægt.
 29.  Efterdi vi da ere Guds Slægt, bør vi ikke mene, at Guddommen er
      lig Guld eller Sølv eller Sten, formet ved Menneskers Kunst og
      Opfindsomhed.
 30.  Efter at Gud altså har båret over med disse Vankundighedens
      Tider, byder han nu Menneskene at de alle og alle Vegne skulle
      omvende sig.
 31.  Thi han har fastsat en Dag, på hvilken han vil dømme Jorderige
      med Retfærdighed ved en Mand, som han har beskikket dertil, og
      dette har han bevist for alle ved at oprejse ham fra de døde."
 32.  Men da de hørte om de dødes Opstandelse, spottede nogle; men
      andre sagde: "Ville atter høre dig om dette."
 33.  Således gik Paulus ud fra dem.
 34.  Men nogle Mænd holdt sig til ham og troede; iblandt hvilke også
      var Areopagiten Dionysius og en Kvinde ved Navn Damaris og andre
      med dem.

Apostelenes gerninger 18

  1.  Derefter forlod Paulus Athen og kom til Korinth
  2.  Der traf han en Jøde ved Navn Akvila, født i Pontus, som nylig
      var kommen fra Italien med sin Hustru Priskilla, fordi Klaudius
      havde befalet, at alle Jøderne skulde forlade Rom. Til disse gik
      han.
  3.  Og efterdi han øvede det samme Håndværk, blev han hos dem og
      arbejdede; thi de vare Teltmagere af Håndværk.
  4.  Men han holdt Samtaler i Synagogen på hver Sabbat og overbeviste
      Jøder og Grækere.
  5.  Men da Silas og Timotheus kom ned fra Makedonien, var Paulus
      helt optagen af at tale og vidnede for Jøderne, at Jesus er
      Kristus.
  6.  Men da de stode imod og spottede, rystede han Støvet af sine
      Klæder og sagde til dem: "Eders Blod komme over eders Hoved! Jeg
      er ren; herefter vil jeg gå til Hedningerne."
  7.  Og han gik bort derfra og gik ind til en Mand ved Navn Justus,
      som frygtede Gud, og hvis Hus lå ved Siden af Synagogen.
  8.  Men Synagogeforstanderen Krispus troede på Herren tillige med
      hele sit Hus, og mange af Korinthierne, som hørte til, troede og
      bleve døbte.
  9.  Men Herren sagde til Paulus i et Syn om Natten: "Frygt ikke, men
      tal og ti ikke,
 10.  eftersom jeg er med dig, og ingen skal lægge Hånd på dig for at
      gøre dig noget ondt; thi jeg har et talrigt Folk i denne By."
 11.  Og han slog sig ned der et År og seks Måneder og lærte Guds Ord
      iblandt dem.
 12.  Men medens Gallio var Statholder i Akaja, stode Jøderne
      endrægtigt op imod Paulus og førte ham for Domstolen og sagde:
 13.  "Denne overtaler Folk til en Gudsdyrkelse imod Loven."
 14.  Og da Paulus vilde oplade Munden, sagde Gallio til Jøderne: "
      Dersom det var nogen Uret eller Misgerning, I Jøder! vilde jeg,
      som billigt var, tålmodigt høre på eder.
 15.  Men er det Stridsspørgsmål om Lære og Navne og om den Lov, som I
      have, da ser selv dertil; thi jeg vil ikke være Dommer over
      disse Ting."
 16.  Og han drev dem bort fra Domstolen.
 17.  Men alle grebe Synagogeforstanderen Sosthenes og sloge ham lige
      for Domstolen; og Gallio brød sig ikke om noget af dette.

 18.  Men Paulus blev der endnu i mange dage; derefter tog han Afsked
      med Brødrene og sejlede bort til Syrien og med ham Priskilla og
      Akvila, efter at han havde ladet sit Hår klippe af i Kenkreæ;
      thi han havde et Løfte på sig.
 19.  Men de kom til Efesus; og der lod han hine blive tilbage; men
      han selv gik ind i Synagogen og samtalede med Jøderne.
 20.  Men da de bade ham om at blive i længere Tid, samtykkede han
      ikke;
 21.  men han tog Afsked og sagde: " (Jeg må endelig holde denne
      forestående Højtid i Jerusalem; men) jeg vil atter vende tilbage
      til eder, om Gud vil." Og han sejlede ud fra Efesus
 22.  og landede i Kæsarea, drog op og hilste på Menigheden og drog så
      ned til Antiokia.

 23.  Og da han havde opholdt sig der nogen Tid, drog han bort og
      rejste fra Sted til Sted igennem det galatiske Land og Frygien
      og styrkede alle Disciplene.

 24.  Men en Jøde ved Navn Apollos, født i Aleksandria, en veltalende
      Mand, som var stærk i Skrifterne, kom til Efesus.
 25.  Denne var undervist om Herrens Vej, og brændende i Ånden talte
      og lærte han grundigt om Jesus, skønt han kun kendte Johannes's
      Dåb.
 26.  Og han begyndte at tale frimodigt i Synagogen. Men da Priskilla
      og Akvila hørte ham,toge de ham til sig og udlagde ham Guds Vej
      nøjere.
 27.  Men da han vilde rejse videre til Akaja, skrev Brødrene til
      Disciplene og opmuntrede dem til at tage imod ham. Da han var
      kommen derhen, var han ved Guds Nåde de troende til megen Nytte;
 28.  thi han gendrev Jøderne offentligt med stor Kraft og beviste ved
      Skrifterne, at Jesus er Kristus.

Apostelenes gerninger 19

  1.  Men det skete, medens Apollos var i Korinth, at Paulus efter at
      være dragen igennem de højereliggende Landsdele kom ned til
      Efesus
  2.  og fandt nogle Disciple, og han sagde til dem: "Fik I den
      Helligånd, da I bleve troende?" Men de sagde til ham: "Vi have
      ikke engang hørt, at der er en Helligånd."
  3.  Og han sagde: "Hvortil bleve I da døbte?" Men de sagde: "Til
      Johannes's Dåb."
  4.  Da sagde Paulus: "Johannes døbte med Omvendelses-Dåb, idet han
      sagde til Folket, at de skulde tro på den, som kom efter ham,
      det er på Jesus."
  5.  Men da de hørte dette, lode de sig døbe til den Herres Jesu
      Navn.
  6.  Og da Paulus lagde Hænderne på dem, kom den Helligånd over dem,
      og de talte i Tunger og profeterede.
  7.  Men de vare i det hele omtrent tolv Mand.
  8.  Og han gik ind i Synagogen og vidnede frimodigt i tre Måneder,
      idet han holdt Samtaler og overbeviste om det, som hører til
      Guds Rige.
  9.  Men da nogle forhærdede sig og strede imod og over for Mængden
      talte ilde om Vejen, forlod han dem og skilte Disciplene fra dem
      og holdt daglig Samtaler i Tyrannus's Skole.
 10.  Men dette varede i to År, så at alle, som boede i Asien, både
      Jøder og Grækere, hørte Herrens Ord.
 11.  Og Gud gjorde usædvanlige kraftige Gerninger ved Paulus's
      Hænder,
 12.  så at man endog bragte Tørklæder og Bælter fra hans Legeme til
      de syge, og Sygdommene vege fra dem, og de onde Ånder fore ud.
 13.  Men også nogle af de omløbende jødiske Besværgere forsøgte at
      nævne den Herres Jesu Navn over dem, som havde de onde Ånder,
      idet de sagde: "Jeg besværger eder ved den Jesus, som Paulus
      prædiker."
 14.  Men de, som gjorde dette, vare syv Sønner af Skeuas, en jødisk
      Ypperstepræst,
 15.  Men den onde Ånd svarede og sagde til dem: "Jesus kender jeg, og
      om Paulus ved jeg; men I, hvem ere I?"
 16.  Og det Menneske, i hvem den onde Ånd var, sprang ind på dem og
      overmandede dem begge og fik sådan Magt over dem, at de flygtede
      nøgne og sårede ud af Huset.
 17.  Men dette blev vitterligt for alle dem, som boede i Efesus, både
      Jøder og Grækere; og der faldt en Frygt over dem alle, og den
      Herres Jesu Navn blev ophøjet,
 18.  og mange af dem, som vare blevne troende, kom og bekendte og
      fortalte om deres Gerninger.
 19.  Men mange af dem, som havde drevet Trolddom, bare deres Bøger
      sammen og opbrændte dem for alles Øjne; og man beregnede deres
      Værdi og fandt dem halvtredsindstyve Tusinde Sølvpenge værd.
 20.  Så kraftigt voksede Herrens Ord og fik Magt.

 21.  Men da dette var fuldbragt, satte Paulus sig for i Ånden, at han
      vilde rejse igennem Makedonien og Akaja og så drage til
      Jerusalem, og han sagde: "Efter at jeg har været der, bør jeg
      også se Rom."
 22.  Og han sendte to af dem, som gik ham til Hånde, Timotheus og
      Erastus, til Makedonien; men selv blev han nogen Tid i Asien.

 23.  Men på den Tid opstod der et ikke lidet Oprør i Anledning af
      Vejen.
 24.  Thi en Sølvsmed ved Navn Demetrius gjorde Artemistempler af Sølv
      og skaffede Kunstnerne ikke ringe Fortjeneste.
 25.  Disse samlede han tillige med de med sådanne Ting sysselsatte
      Arbejdere og sagde: "I Mænd! I vide, at vi have vort Udkomme af
      dette Arbejde.
 26.  Og I se og høre, at ikke alene i Efesus, men næsten i hele Asien
      har denne Paulus ved sin Overtalelse vildledt en stor Mængde,
      idet han siger, at de ikke ere Guder, de, som gøres med Hænder.
 27.  Men der er ikke alene Fare for, at denne vor Håndtering skal
      komme i Foragt, men også for, at den store Gudinde Artemis's
      Helligdom skal blive agtet for intet, og at den Gudindes
      Majestæt, hvem hele Asien og Jorderige dyrker, skal blive
      krænket."
 28.  Men da de hørte dette, bleve de fulde af Vrede og råbte og
      sagde: "Stor er Efesiernes Artemis!"
 29.  Og Byen kom i fuldt Oprør, og de stormede endrægtigt til Teatret
      og reve Makedonierne Hajus og Aristarkus, Paulus's Rejsefæller,
      med sig.
 30.  Men da Paulus vilde gå ind iblandt Folkemængden, tilstedte
      Disciplene ham det ikke.
 31.  Men også nogle af Asiarkerne, som vare hans Venner, sendte Bud
      til ham og formanede ham til ikke at vove sig hen til Teatret.
 32.  Da skrege nogle eet, andre et andet; thi Forsamlingen var i
      Forvirring, og de fleste vidste ikke, af hvad Årsag de vare
      komne sammen.
 33.  Men de trak Aleksander, hvem Jøderne skøde frem, ud af Skaren;
      men Aleksander slog til Lyd med Hånden og vilde holde en
      Forsvarstale til Folket.
 34.  Men da de fik at vide, at han var en Jøde, råbte de alle med een
      Røst i omtrent to Timer: "Stor er Efesiernes Artemis!"
 35.  Men Byskriveren fik Skaren beroliget og sagde: "I Mænd i Efesus!
      hvilket Menneske er der vel, som ikke ved, at Efesiernes By er
      Tempelværge for den store Artemis og det himmelfaldne Billede?
 36.  Når altså dette er uimodsigeligt, bør I være rolige og ikke
      foretage eder noget fremfusende.
 37.  Thi I have ført disse Mænd hid, som hverken er Tempelranere
      eller bespotte eders Gudinde.
 38.  Dersom nu Demetrius og hans Kunstnere have Klage imod nogen, da
      holdes der Tingdage, og der er Statholdere; lad dem kalde
      hinanden for Retten!
 39.  Men have I noget Forlangende om andre Sager, så vil det blive
      afgjort i den lovlige Forsamling.
 40.  Vi stå jo endog i Fare for at anklages for Oprør for, hvad der i
      Dag er sket, da der ingen Årsag er dertil; herfor, for dette
      Opløb, ville vi ikke kunne gøre regnskab."
 41.  Og da han havde sagt dette, lod han Forsamlingen fare.

Apostelenes gerninger 20

  1.  Men efter at dette Røre var stillet, lod Paulus Disciplene hente
      og formanede dem, tog Afsked og begav sig derfra for at rejse
      til Makedonien.
  2.  Og da han var dragen igennem disse Egne og havde formanet dem
      med megen Tale, kom han til Grækenland.
  3.  Der tilbragte han tre Måneder, og da Jøderne havde Anslag for
      imod ham, just som han skulde til at sejle til Syrien, blev han
      til Sinds at vende tilbage igennem Makedonien.
  4.  Men Pyrrus's Søn Sopater fra Berøa og af Thessalonikerne
      Aristarkus og Sekundus og Kajus fra Derbe og Timotheus og af
      Asiaterne Tykikus og Trofimus fulgte med ham til Asien.
  5.  Disse droge forud og biede på os i Troas;
  6.  men vi sejlede efter de usyrede Brøds Dage ud fra Filippi og kom
      fem Dage efter til dem i Troas, hvor vi tilbragte syv Dage.
  7.  Men på den første Dag i Ugen, da vi vare forsamlede for at bryde
      Brødet, samtalede Paulus med dem, da han den næste Dag vilde
      rejse derfra, og han blev ved med at tale indtil Midnat.
  8.  Men der var mange Lamper i Salen ovenpå, hvor vi vare samlede.
  9.  Og der sad i Vinduet en ung Mand ved Navn Eutykus; han faldt i
      en dyb Søvn, da Paulus fortsatte Samtalen så længe, og
      overvældet af Søvnen styrtede han ned fra det tredje Stokværk og
      blev tagen død op.
 10.  Men Paulus gik ned og kastede sig over ham og omfavnede ham og
      sagde: "Larmer ikke; thi hans Sjæl er i ham."
 11.  Men han gik op igen og brød Brødet og nød deraf og talte endnu
      længe med dem indtil Dagningen, og dermed drog han bort.
 12.  Men de bragte det unge Menneske levende op og vare ikke lidet
      trøstede.

 13.  Men vi gik forud til Skibet og sejlede til Assus og skulde
      derfra tage Paulus med; thi således havde han bestemt det, da
      han selv vilde gå til Fods.
 14.  Da han nu stødte til os i Assus, toge vi ham om Bord og kom til
      Mitylene.
 15.  Og vi sejlede derfra og kom den næste Dag lige udfor Kios; Dagen
      derpå lagde vi til ved Samos og kom næste Dag til Milet.
 16.  Thi Paulus havde besluttet at sejle Efesus forbi, for at det
      ikke skulde hændes, at han blev opholdt i Asien; thi han hastede
      for at komme til Jerusalem på Pinsedagen, om det var ham muligt.
 17.  Men fra Milet sendte han Bud til Efesus og lod Menighedens
      Ældste kalde til sig.
 18.  Og da de kom til ham, sagde han til dem: "I vide, hvorledes jeg
      færdedes iblandt eder den hele Tid igennem fra den første Dag,
      jeg kom til Asien,
 19.  idet jeg tjente Herren i al Ydmyghed og under Tårer og
      Prøvelser, som timedes mig ved Jødernes Efterstræbelser;
 20.  hvorledes jeg ikke har unddraget mig fra at forkynde eder noget
      som helst af det, som kunde være til Gavn, og at lære eder
      offentligt og i Husene,
 21.  idet jeg vidnede både for Jøder og Grækere om Omvendelsen til
      Gud og Troen på vor Herre Jesus Kristus.
 22.  Og nu se, bunden af Ånden drager jeg til Jerusalem uden at vide,
      hvad der skal møde mig,
 23.  kun, at den Helligånd i hver By vidner for mig og siger, at
      Lænker og Trængsler vente mig.
 24.  Men jeg agter ikke mit Liv noget værd for mig selv, for at jeg
      kan fuldende mit Løb og den Tjeneste, som jeg har fået af den
      Herre Jesus, at vidne om Guds Nådes Evangelium.
 25.  Og nu se, jeg ved, at I ikke mere skulle se mit Ansigt, alle I,
      iblandt hvem jeg gik om og prædikede Riget.
 26.  Derfor vidner jeg for eder på denne Dag, at jeg er ren for alles
      Blod;
 27.  thi jeg unddrog mig ikke fra at forkynde eder hele Guds Råd.
 28.  Så giver Agt på eder selv og den hele Hjord, i hvilken den
      Helligånd satte eder som Tilsynsmænd, til at vogte Guds
      Menighed, som han erhvervede sig med sit eget Blod.
 29.  Jeg ved, at der efter min Bortgang skal komme svare Ulve ind
      iblandt eder, som ikke ville spare Hjorden.
 30.  Og af eders egen Midte skal der opstå Mænd, som skulle tale
      forvendte Ting for at drage Disciplene efter sig.
 31.  Derfor våger og kommer i Hu, at jeg har ikke ophørt i tre År,
      Nat og Dag, at påminde hver enkelt med Tårer.
 32.  Og nu overgiver jeg eder til Gud og hans Nådes Ord, som formår
      at opbygge eder og at give eder Arven iblandt alle de helligede.
 33.  Jeg har ikke begæret nogens Sølv eller Guld eller Klædebon.
 34.  I vide selv, at disse Hænder have tjent for mine Fornødenheder
      og for dem, som vare med mig.
 35.  Jeg viste eder i alle Ting, at således bør vi arbejde og tage os
      af de skrøbelige og ihukomme den Herres Jesu Ord, at han selv
      har sagt: "Det er saligere at give end at tage."
 36.  Og da han havde sagt dette, faldt han på sine Knæ og bad med dem
      alle.
 37.  Og de brast alle i heftig Gråd, og de faldt Paulus om Halsen og
      kyssede ham.
 38.  Og mest smertede dem det Ord, han havde sagt, at de ikke mere
      skulde se hans Ansigt. Så ledsagede de ham til Skibet.

Apostelenes gerninger 21

  1.  Men da vi havde revet os løs fra dem og vare afsejlede, droge vi
      lige til Kos, og den næste Dag til Rodus og derfra til Patara.
  2.  Og da vi fandt et Skib, som skulde gå lige til Fønikien, gik vi
      om Bord og afsejlede.
  3.  Men da vi havde fået Kypern i Sigte og vare komne den forbi til
      venstre for os, sejlede vi til Synen og landede i Tyrus; thi der
      skulde Skibet losse sin Ladning.
  4.  Og vi opsøgte Disciplene og bleve der syv Dage; disse sagde ved
      Ånden til Paulus, at han ikke skulde drage op til Jerusalem.
  5.  Men da vi havde tilendebragt disse Dage, droge vi derfra og
      rejste videre, idet de alle, med Hustruer og Børn, ledsagede os
      uden for Byen; og efter at have knælet på Strandbredden og holdt
      Bøn
  6.  toge vi Afsked med hverandre; og vi gik om Bord i Skibet, men de
      vendte tilbage til deres Hjem.

  7.  Men vi fuldendte Sejladsen og kom fra Tyrus til Ptolemais, og vi
      hilste på Brødrene og bleve een Dag hos dem.
  8.  Og den følgende Dag droge vi derfra og kom til Kæsarea, og vi
      gik ind i Evangelisten Filips Hus, han, som var en af de syv, og
      bleve hos ham.
  9.  Men denne havde fire ugifte Døtre, som profeterede.
 10.  Men da vi bleve der flere Dage, kom der en Profet ned fra Judæa
      ved Navn Agabus.
 11.  Og han kom til os og tog Paulus's Bælte og bandt sine egne
      Fødder og Hænder og sagde: "Dette siger den Helligånd: Den Mand,
      hvem dette Bælte tilhører, skulle Jøderne binde således i
      Jerusalem og overgive i Hedningers Hænder."
 12.  Men da vi hørte dette, bade såvel vi som de der på Stedet ham om
      ikke at drage op til Jerusalem.
 13.  Da svarede Paulus: "Hvad gøre I, at I græde og gøre mit Hjerte
      modløst? thi jeg er rede til ikke alene at bindes, men også at
      dø i Jerusalem for den Herres Jesu Navns Skyld."
 14.  Da han nu ikke vilde lade sig overtale, bleve vi stille og
      sagde: "Herrens Villie ske!"

 15.  Men efter disse Dage gjorde vi os rede og droge op til
      Jerusalem.
 16.  Og også nogle af Disciplene fra Kæsarea rejste med os og bragte
      os til Mnason, en Mand fra Kypern, en gammel Discipel, hos hvem
      vi skulde have Herberge.
 17.  Da vi nu kom til Jerusalem, modtoge Brødrene os med Glæde.
 18.  Og Dagen efter gik Paulus ind med os til Jakob, og alle de
      Ældste kom derhen.
 19.  Og da han havde hilst på dem, fortalte han Stykke for Stykke,
      hvad Gud havde gjort iblandt Hedningerne ved hans Tjeneste.
 20.  Men da de hørte dette, priste de Gud og de sagde til ham:
      "Broder! du ser, hvor mange Tusinder der er af Jøderne, som have
      antaget Troen, og de ere alle nidkære for Loven.
 21.  Men de have hørt om dig, at du lærer alle Jøderne ude iblandt
      Hedningerne at falde fra Moses og siger, at de ikke skulle
      omskære Børnene, ej heller vandre efter Skikkene.
 22.  Hvad er der da at gøre? Der må sikkert komme mange Mennesker
      sammen; thi de ville få at høre, at du er kommen.
 23.  Gør derfor dette, som vi sige dig: Vi have her fire Mænd, som
      have et Løfte på sig.
 24.  Tag dem med dig, og rens dig sammen med dem,, og gør
      Omkostningen for dem, for at de kunne lade deres Hoved rage; så
      ville alle erkende, at det, som de have hørt om dig, ikke har
      noget på sig, men at du også selv vandrer således, at du holder
      Loven.
 25.  Men om de Hedninger, som ere blevne troende, have vi udsendt en
      Skrivelse med den Afgørelse, at de intet sådant skulle holde,
      men kun vogte sig for Afgudsofferkød og Blod og det kvalte og
      Utugt."
 26.  Da tog Paulus Mændene med sig næste dag, og efter at have renset
      sig sammen med dem gik han ind i Helligdommen og anmeldte
      Renselsesdagenes Udløb, da Offeret blev bragt for hver enkelt af
      dem.

 27.  Men da de syv Dage næsten vare til Ende, satte Jøderne fra
      Asien, som havde set ham i Helligdommen, hele Mængden i Oprør og
      lagde Hånd på ham
 28.  og råbte: "I israelitiske Mænd, kommer til Hjælp! Denne er det
      Menneske, som alle Vegne lærer alle imod Folket og Loven og
      dette Sted; og tilmed har han også ført Grækere ind i
      Helligdommen og gjort dette hellige Sted urent;"
 29.  de havde nemlig i Forvejen set Efesieren Trofimus i Staden
      sammen med ham, og ham mente de, at Paulus havde ført ind i
      Helligdommen.
 30.  Og hele Staden kom i Bevægelse, og Folket stimlede sammen; og de
      grebe Paulus og slæbte ham uden for Helligdommen, og straks
      bleve Dørene lukkede.
 31.  Og da de søgte at slå ham ihjel, gik der Melding op til
      Krigsøversten for Vagtafdelingen, at hele Jerusalem var i Oprør.
 32.  Han tog straks Stridsmænd og Høvedsmænd med sig og ilede ned
      imod dem. Men da de så Krigsøversten og Stridsmændene, holdt de
      op at slå Paulus.
 33.  Da trådte Krigsøversten til, greb ham og befalede, at han skulde
      bindes med to Lænker, og han spurgte, hvem han var, og hvad han
      havde gjort.
 34.  Da råbte nogle i Skaren eet, andre et andet til ham; men da han
      ikke kunde få noget pålideligt at vide på Grund af Larmen,
      befalede han at føre ham ind i Borgen,
 35.  Men da han kom på Trappen, gik det således, at han måtte bæres
      af Stridsmændene på Grund af Skarens Voldsomhed;
 36.  thi Folkemængden fulgte efter og råbte: "Bort med ham!"
 37.  Og da Paulus var ved at blive ført ind i Borgen, siger han til
      Krigsøversten: "Er det mig tilladt at sige noget til dig?" Men
      han sagde: "Forstår du Græsk?
 38.  Er du da ikke den Ægypter, som for nogen Tid siden gjorde Oprør
      og førte de fire Tusinde Stimænd ud i Ørkenen?"
 39.  Men Paulus sagde: "Jeg er en jødisk Mand fra Tarsus, Borger i en
      ikke ubekendt By i Kilikien. Men jeg beder dig, tilsted mig at
      tale til Folket!"
 40.  Og da han tilstedte det, stod Paulus frem på Trappen og slog til
      Lyd med Hånden for Folket. Men da der var blevet dyb Tavshed,
      tiltalte han dem i det hebraiske Sprog og sagde:

Apostelenes gerninger 22

  1.  " I Mænd, Brødre og Fædre! hører nu mit forsvar over for eder!"
  2.  Men da de hørte, at han talte til dem i det hebraiske Sprog,
      holdt de sig end mere stille. Og han siger:
  3.  "Jeg er en jødisk Mand, født i Tarsus i Kilikien, men opfostret
      i denne Stad, oplært ved Gamaliels Fødder efter vor Fædrenelovs
      Strenghed og nidkær for Gud, ligesom I alle ere i Dag.
  4.  Og jeg forfulgte denne Vej indtil Døden, idet jeg lagde både
      Mænd og Kvinder i Lænker og overgav dem til Fængsler,
  5.  som også Ypperstepræsten vidner med mig og hele Ældsterådet, fra
      hvem jeg endog fik Breve med til Brødrene i Damaskus og rejste
      derhen for også at føre dem, som vare der, bundne til Jerusalem,
      for at de måtte blive straffede.
  6.  Men det skete, da jeg var undervejs og nærmede mig til Damaskus,
      at ved Middag et stærkt Lys fra Himmelen pludseligt omstrålede
      mig.
  7.  Og jeg faldt til Jorden og hørte en Røst, som sagde til mig:
      Saul!  Saul! hvorfor forfølger du mig?
  8.  Men jeg svarede: Hvem er du, Herre? Og han sagde til mig: Jeg er
      Jesus af Nazareth, som du forfølger.
  9.  Men de, som vare med mig, så vel Lyset, men hørte ikke hans
      Røst, som talte til mig.
 10.  Men jeg sagde: Hvad skal jeg gøre, Herre? Men Herren sagde til
      mig: Stå op og gå til Damaskus; og der skal der blive talt til
      dig om alt, hvad der er bestemt, at du skal gøre.
 11.  Men da jeg havde mistet Synet ved Glansen af hint Lys, blev jeg
      ledet ved Hånden af dem, som vare med mig, og kom således ind i
      Damaskus.
 12.  Men en vis Ananias, en Mand, gudfrygtig efter Loven, som havde
      godt Vidnesbyrd af alle Jøderne, som boede der,
 13.  kom til mig og stod for mig og sagde: Saul, Broder, se op! Og
      jeg så op på ham i samme Stund.
 14.  Men han sagde: Vore Fædres Gud har udvalgt dig til at kende hans
      Villie og se den retfærdige og høre en Røst af hans Mund.
 15.  Thi du skal være ham et Vidne for alle Mennesker om de Ting, som
      du har set og hørt.
 16.  Og nu, hvorfor tøver du? Stå op, lad dig døbe og dine Synder
      aftvætte, idet du påkalder hans Navn!
 17.  Og det skete, da jeg var kommen tilbage til Jerusalem og bad i
      Helligdommen, at jeg faldt i Henrykkelse
 18.  og så ham, idet han sagde til mig: Skynd dig, og gå hastigt ud
      af Jerusalem, thi de skulle ikke af dig modtage Vidnesbyrd om
      mig.
 19.  Og jeg sagde: Herre! de vide selv, at jeg fængslede og piskede
      trindt om i Synagogerne dem, som troede på dig,
 20.  og da dit Vidne Stefanus's Blod blev udgydt, stod også jeg hos
      og havde Behag deri og vogtede på deres Klæder, som sloge ham
      ihjel.
 21.  Og han sagde til mig: Drag ud; thi jeg vil sende dig langt bort
      til Hedninger."

 22.  Men de hørte på ham indtil dette Ord, da opløftede de deres Røst
      og sagde: "Bort fra Jorden med en sådan! thi han bør ikke
      leve.""
 23.  Men da de skrege og reve Klæderne af sig og kastede Støv op i
      Luften,
 24.  befalede Krigsøversten, at han skulde føres ind i Borgen, og
      sagde, at man med Hudstrygning skulde forhøre ham, for at han
      kunde få at vide, af hvad Årsag de således råbte imod ham.
 25.  Men da de havde udstrakt ham for Svøberne, sagde Paulus til den
      hosstående Høvedsmand: "Er det eder tilladt at hudstryge en
      romersk Mand, og det uden Dom?"
 26.  Men da Høvedsmanden hørte dette, gik han til Krigsøversten og
      meldte ham det og sagde: "Hvad er det, du et ved at gøre? denne
      Mand er jo en Romer."
 27.  Men Krigsøversten gik hen og sagde til ham: "Sig mig, er du en
      Romer?" Han sagde: "Ja."
 28.  Og Krigsøversten svarede: "Jeg har købt mig denne Borgerret for
      en stor Sum," Men Paulus sagde: "Jeg er endog født dertil."
 29.  Da trak de, som skulde til at forhøre ham, sig straks tilbage
      fra ham. Og da Krigsøversten fik at vide, at han var en Romer,
      blev også han bange, fordi han havde bundet ham.
 30.  Men den næste Dag, da han vilde have noget pålideligt at vide
      om, hvad han anklagedes for af Jøderne, løste han ham og
      befalede, at Ypperstepræsterne og hele Rådet skulde komme
      sammen, og han førte Paulus ned og stillede ham for dem.

Apostelenes gerninger 23

  1.  Da så Paulus fast på Rådet og sagde: "I Mænd, Brødre! jeg har
      med al god Samvittighed vandret for Gud indtil denne Dag."
  2.  Men Ypperstepræsten Ananias befalede dem, som stode hos ham, at
      slå ham på Munden.
  3.  Da sagde Paulus til ham: "Gud skal slå dig, du kalkede Væg! Og
      du sidder for at dømme mig efter Loven, og tvært imod Loven
      befaler du, at jeg skal slås."
  4.  Men de, som stode hos, sagde: "Udskælder du Guds Ypperstepræst?"
  5.  Og Paulus sagde: "Brødre! jeg vidste ikke, at han er
      Ypperstepræst; thi der er skrevet: En Fyrste i dit Folk må du
      ikke tale ondt imod."
  6.  Men da Paulus vidste, at den ene Del bestod af Saddukæere, men
      den anden af Farisæere, råbte han i Rådet: "I Mænd, Brødre! jeg
      er en Farisæer, Søn af Farisæere, for Håb og for dødes
      Opstandelse er det, jeg dømmes."
  7.  Men da han udtalte dette, opkom der Splid imellem Farisæerne og
      Saddukæerne, og Mængden blev uenig.
  8.  Thi Saddukæerne sige, at der ingen Opstandelse er, ej heller
      nogen Engel eller Ånd; men Farisæerne hævde begge Dele.
  9.  Men der opstod en stærk Råben; og nogle af de skriftkloge af
      Farisæernes Parti stode op, strede heftigt og sagde: "Vi finde
      intet ondt hos dette Menneske; men hvad om en Ånd eller en Engel
      har talt til ham!"
 10.  Men da der blev stærk Splid frygtede Krigsøversten, at Paulus
      skulde blive sønderslidt af dem, og befalede Krigsfolket at gå
      ned og rive ham ud fra dem og føre ham ind i Borgen.
 11.  Men Natten derefter stod Herren for ham og sagde: "Vær frimodig,
      thi ligesom du har vidnet om mig i Jerusalem, således skal du
      også vidne i Rom."

 12.  Men da det var blevet Dag, sloge Jøderne sig sammen og
      forpligtede sig under Forbandelser til hverken at spise eller
      drikke, førend de havde slået Paulus ihjel.
 13.  Og de, som havde indgået denne Sammensværgelse, vare flere end
      fyrretyve i Tal.
 14.  Disse gik da til Ypperstepræsterne og de Ældste og sagde: "Vi
      have under Forbandelser forpligtet os til ikke at smage noget,
      førend vi have slået Paulus ihjel.
 15.  Så giver nu I tillige med Rådet Krigsøversten Meddelelse, for at
      han må føre ham ned til eder, som om I ville undersøge hans Sag
      nøjere; men vi ere rede til at slå ham ihjel, førend han kommer
      derhen."
 16.  Men Paulus's Søstersøn, som havde hørt om dette Anslag, kom og
      gik ind i Borgen og fortalte Paulus det.
 17.  Men Paulus kaldte en af Høvedsmændene til sig og sagde: "Før
      denne unge Mand hen til Krigsøversten; thi han har noget at
      melde ham."
 18.  Da tog han ham og førte ham til Krigsøversten og siger: "Den
      fangne Paulus kaldte mig og bad mig føre denne unge Mand til
      dig, da han har noget at tale med dig om."
 19.  Men Krigsøversten tog ham ved Hånden, gik hen til en Side og
      spurgte: "Hvad er det, som du har at melde mig?"
 26.  Men han sagde: "Jøderne have aftalt at bede dig om at lade
      Paulus føre ned for Rådet i Morgen under Foregivende af at ville
      have nøjere Underretning om ham.
 21.  Lad du dig nu ikke overtale af dem; thi mere end fyrretyve Mænd
      af dem lure på ham, og de have under Forbandelser forpligtet sig
      til hverken at spise eller at drikke, førend de have slået ham
      ihjel; og nu ere de rede og vente på dit Tilsagn."
 22.  Da lod Krigsøversten det unge Menneske fare og bød ham: "Du skal
      ingen sige, at du har givet mig dette til Kende."

 23.  Og han kaldte et Par af Høvedsmændene til sig og sagde: "Gører
      to Hundrede Stridsmænd rede til at drage til Kæsarea og
      halvfjerdsindstyve Ryttere og to Hundrede Spydkastere fra den
      tredje Time i Nat; "
 24.  og at de skulde bringe Lastdyr for at kunne lade Paulus ride og
      føre ham sikkert til Landshøvdingen Feliks.
 25.  Og han skrev et Brev af følgende Indhold:
 26.  "Klaudius Lysias hilser den mægtigste Landshøvding Feliks.
 27.  Denne Mand havde Jøderne grebet og vilde have slået ham ihjel;
      men jeg kom til med Krigsfolket og udfriede ham, da jeg
      erfarede, at han var en Romer.
 28.  Og da jeg vilde vide Årsagen, hvorfor de anklagede ham, førte
      jeg ham ned for deres Råd
 29.  og fandt ham anklaget i Anledning af nogle Stridsspørgsmål i
      deres Lov, men uden nogen Beskyldning, som fortjente Død eller
      Fængsel.
 30.  Men da jeg har fået Underretning om, at der skulde være et
      hemmeligt Anslag af Jøderne imod Manden, har jeg straks sendt
      ham til dig efter også at have befalet Anklagerne at fremføre
      for dig, hvad de have imod ham."
 31.  Da toge Stridsmændene Paulus, som det var dem befalet, og førte
      ham om Natten til Antipatris.
 32.  Men næste Dag lode de Rytterne drage videre med ham og vendte
      selv tilbage til Borgen.
 33.  Da hine nu kom til Kæsarea og havde overgivet Landshøvdingen
      Brevet, fremstillede de også Paulus for ham.
 34.  Men da han havde læst Brevet og spurgt, fra hvilken Provins han
      var, og havde erfaret, at han var fra Kilikien, sagde han:
 35.  "Jeg vil forhøre dig, når også dine Anklagere komme til Stede."
      Og han bød, at han skulde holdes bevogtet i Herodes's Borg.

Apostelenes gerninger 24

  1.  Men fem Dage derefter drog Ypperstepræsten Ananias ned med nogle
      Ældste og en Taler, Tertullus, og disse førte Klage for
      Landshøvdingen imod Paulus.
  2.  Da han nu var kaldt ind, begyndte Tertullus at anklage ham og
      sagde:
  3.  "At vi ved dig nyde megen Fred, og at Forbedringer i alle
      Retninger og alle Vegne skaffes dette Folk ved din Omsorg,
      mægtigste Feliks!  det erkende vi med al Taknemmelighed.
  4.  Men for at jeg ikke skal opholde dig for længe, beder jeg, at du
      efter din Mildhed vil høre os kortelig.
  5.  Vi have nemlig fundet, at denne Mand er en Pest og en
      Oprørsstifter iblandt alle Jøderne hele Verden over, samt er
      Fører for Nazaræernes Parti,
  6.  ja, han har endog forsøgt at vanhellige Helligdommen. Vi grebe
      ham da også og vilde have dømt ham efter vor Lov.
  7.  Men Krigsøversten Lysias kom til og borttog ham med megen Vold
      af vore Hænder
  8.  og bød hans Anklagere komme til dig. Af ham kan du selv, når du
      undersøger det, erfare alt det, hvorfor vi anklage ham."
  9.  Men også Jøderne stemmede i med og påstode, at dette forholdt
      sig således.

 10.  Og Paulus svarede, da Landshøvdingen gav ham et Vink, at han
      skulde tale: "Efterdi jeg ved, at du i mange År har været Dommer
      for dette Folk, vil jeg frimodigt forsvare min Sag,
 11.  da du kan forvisse dig om, at det er ikke mere end tolv Dage,
      siden jeg kom op for at tilbede i Jerusalem.
 12.  Og de have ikke fundet mig i Ordveksel med nogen eller i Færd
      med at vække Folkeopløb, hverken i Helligdommen eller i
      Synagogerne eller omkring i Staden.
 13.  Og de kunne ej heller bevise dig det, som de nu anklage mig for.
 14.  Men dette bekender jeg for dig, at jeg efter den Vej, som de
      kalde et Parti, tjener vor fædrene Gud således, at jeg tror på
      alt det, som står i Loven, og det, som er skrevet hos
      Profeterne,
 15.  og har det Håb til Gud, som også disse selv forvente, at der
      skal komme en Opstandelse både af retfærdige og af uretfærdige.
 16.  Derfor øver også jeg mig i altid at have en uskadt Samvittighed
      for Gud og Menneskene.
 17.  Men efter flere Års Forløb er jeg kommen for at bringe Almisser
      til mit Folk og Ofre,
 18.  hvad de fandt mig i Færd med, da jeg var bleven renset i
      Helligdommen, og ikke med Opløb og Larm; men det var nogle Jøder
      fra Asien,
 19.  og de burde nu være til Stede hos dig og klage, om de have noget
      på mig at sige.
 20.  Eller lad disse her selv sige, hvad Uret de have fundet hos mig,
      da jeg stod for Rådet,
 21.  uden det skulde være dette ene Ord, som jeg råbte, da jeg stod
      iblandt dem: Jeg dømmes i Dag af eder for dødes Opstandelse."

 22.  Nu udsatte Feliks Sagen, da han vidste ret god Besked om Vejen,
      og sagde: "Når Krigsøversten Lysias kommer herned, vil jeg
      påkende eders Sag."
 23.  Og han befalede Høvedsmanden, at han skulde holdes bevogtet, men
      med Lempelse, og at han ikke måtte forbyde nogen af hans egne at
      gå ham til Hånde.
 24.  Men nogle Dage efter kom Feliks med sin Hustru Drusilla, som var
      en Jødinde, og lod Paulus hente og hørte ham om Troen på Kristus
      Jesus.
 25.  Men da han talte med ham om Retfærdighed og Afholdenhed og den
      kommende Dom, blev Feliks forfærdet 6g svarede: "Gå for denne
      Gang; men når jeg får Tid, vil jeg lade dig kalde til mig."
 26.  Tillige håbede han også, at Paulus skulde give ham Penge; derfor
      lod han ham også oftere hente og samtalede med ham.
 27.  Men da to År vare forløbne, fik Feliks Porkius Festus til
      Efterfølger; og da Feliks vilde fortjene sig Tak af Jøderne, lod
      han Paulus blive tilbage i Lænker.

Apostelenes gerninger 25

  1.  Da Festus nu havde tiltrådt sit Landshøvdingembede, drog han
      efter tre Dages Forløb fra Kæsarea op til Jerusalem.
  2.  Da førte Ypperstepræsterne og de fornemste af Jøderne Klage hos
      ham imod Paulus og henvendte sig til ham,
  3.  idet de med ondt i Sinde imod Paulus bade ham om at bevise dem
      den Gunst, at han vilde lade ham hente til Jerusalem; thi de
      lurede på at slå ham ihjel på Vejen.
  4.  Da svarede Festus, at Paulus blev holdt bevogtet i Kæsarea, men
      at han selv snart vilde drage derned.
  5.  "Lad altså," sagde han, "dem iblandt eder, der have Myndighed
      dertil, drage med ned og anklage ham, dersom der er noget
      uskikkeligt ved Manden."
  6.  Og da han havde opholdt sig hos dem ikke mere end otte eller ti
      Dage, drog han ned til Kæsarea, og den næste Dag satte han sig
      på Dommersædet og befalede, at Paulus skulde føres frem.
  7.  Men da han kom til Stede, stillede de Jøder, som vare komne ned
      fra Jerusalem sig omkring ham og fremførte mange og svare
      Klagemål, som de ikke kunde bevise,
  8.  efterdi Paulus forsvarede sig og sagde: "Hverken imod Jødernes
      Lov eller imod Helligdommen eller imod Kejseren har jeg syndet i
      noget Stykke."

  9.  Men Festus. som vilde fortjene sig Tak af Jøderne, svarede
      Paulus og sagde: "Er du villig til at drage op til Jerusalem og
      der stå for min Domstol i denne Sag?"
 10.  Men Paulus sagde: "Jeg står for Kejserens Domstol, og der bør
      jeg dømmes. Jøderne har jeg ingen Uret gjort, som også du ved
      helt vel.
 11.  Dersom jeg så har Uret og har gjort noget, som fortjener Døden,
      vægrer jeg mig ikke ved at dø; men hvis det, hvorfor disse
      anklage mig, intet har på sig, da kan ingen prisgive mig til
      dem. Jeg skyder mig ind under Kejseren."
 12.  Da talte Festus med sit Råd og svarede: "Du har skudt dig ind
      under Kejseren; du skal rejse til Kejseren."

 13.  Men da nogle Dage vare forløbne, kom Kong Agrippa og Berenike
      til Kæsarea og hilste på Festus.
 14.  Og da de opholdt sig der i flere Dage, forelagde Festus Kongen
      Paulus's Sag og sagde: "Der er en Mand, efterladt af Feliks som
      Fange;
 15.  imod ham førte Jødernes Ypperstepræster og Ældste Klage, da jeg
      var i Jerusalem, og bade om Dom over ham.
 16.  Dem svarede jeg, at Romere ikke have for Skik at prisgive noget
      Menneske, førend den anklagede har Anklagerne personligt til
      Stede og får Lejlighed til at forsvare sig imod Beskyldningen.
 17.  Da de altså kom sammen her, tøvede jeg ikke, men satte mig den
      næste Dag på Dommersædet og bød, at Manden skulde føres frem.
 18.  Men da Anklagerne stode omkring ham, fremførte de ingen sådan
      Beskyldning, som jeg havde formodet;
 19.  men de havde nogle Stridsspørgsmål med ham om deres egen
      Gudsdyrkelse og om en Jesus, som er død, men som Paulus påstod
      er i Live.
 20.  Men da jeg var tvivlrådig angående Undersøgelsen heraf, sagde
      jeg, om han vilde rejse til Jerusalem og der lade denne Sag
      pådømme.
 21.  Men da Paulus gjorde Påstand på at holdes bevogtet til Kejserens
      Kendelse, befalede jeg, at han skulde holdes bevogtet, indtil
      jeg kan sende ham til Kejseren."
 22.  Da sagde Agrippa til Festus: "Jeg kunde også selv ønske at høre
      den Mand." Men han sagde: "I Morgen skal du få ham at høre."
 23.  Næste Dag altså, da Agrippa og Berenike kom med stor Pragt og
      gik ind i Forhørssalen tillige med Krigsøversterne og Byens
      ypperste Mænd, blev på Festus's Befaling Paulus ført frem.
 24.  Og Festus siger: "Kong Agrippa, og alle I Mænd, som ere med os
      til Stede! her se I ham, om hvem hele Jødernes Mængde har
      henvendt sig til mig, både i Jerusalem og her, råbende på, at
      han ikke længer bør leve.
 25.  Men jeg indså, at han intet havde gjort, som fortjente Døden, og
      da han selv skød sig ind under Kejseren, besluttede jeg at sende
      ham derhen.
 26.  Dog har jeg intet sikkert at skrive om ham til min Herre. Derfor
      lod jeg ham føre frem for eder og især for dig, Kong Agrippa!
      for at jeg kan have noget at skrive, når Undersøgelsen er sket.
 27.  Thi det synes mig urimeligt at sende en Fange uden også at
      angive Beskyldningerne imod ham."

Apostelenes gerninger 26

  1.  Men Agrippa sagde til Paulus: "Det tilstedes dig at tale om dig
      selv." Da udrakte Paulus Hånden og forsvarede sig således:
  2.  "Jeg agter mig selv lykkelig, fordi jeg i Dag skal forsvare mig
      for dig angående alle de Ting, for hvilke jeg anklages af
      Jøderne, Kong Agrippa!
  3.  navnlig fordi du er kendt med alle Jødernes Skikke og
      Stridsspørgsmål; derfor beder jeg dig om, at du tålmodigt vil
      høre mig.
  4.  Mit Levned fra Ungdommen af, som fra Begyndelsen har været ført
      iblandt mit Folk og i Jerusalem, vide alle Jøderne Besked om;
  5.  thi de kende mig i Forvejen lige fra først af (om de ellers
      ville vidne), at jeg har levet som Farisæer efter det strengeste
      Parti i vor Gudsdyrkelse.
  6.  Og nu står jeg her og dømmes for Håbet på den Forjættelse, som
      er given af Gud til vore Fædre,
  7.  og som vort Tolvstammefolk håber at nå frem til, idet de tjene
      Gud uafladeligt Nat og Dag; for dette Håbs Skyld anklages jeg af
      Jøder, o Konge!
  8.  Hvor kan det holdes for utroligt hos eder, at Gud oprejser døde?
  9.  Jeg selv mente nu også at burde gøre meget imod Jesu,
      Nazaræerens Navn,
 10.  og det gjorde jeg også i Jerusalem; og jeg indespærrede mange af
      de hellige i Fængsler, da jeg havde fået Fuldmagt dertil af
      Ypperstepræsterne, og når de bleve slåede ihjel, gav jeg min
      Stemme dertil.
 11.  Og i alle Synagogerne lod jeg dem ofte straffe og tvang dem til
      at tale bespotteligt, og rasende end mere imod dem forfulgte jeg
      dem endog til de udenlandske Byer.
 12.  Da jeg i dette Øjemed drog til Damaskus med Fuldmagt og
      Myndighed fra Ypperstepræsterne,
 13.  så jeg undervejs midt på Dagen, o Konge! et Lys fra Himmelen,
      som overgik Solens Glans, omstråle mig og dem, som rejste med
      mig.
 14.  Men da vi alle faldt til Jorden, hørte jeg en Røst, som sagde
      til mig i det hebraiske Sprog: Saul! Saul! hvorfor forfølger du
      mig? det bliver dig hårdt at stampe imod Brodden.
 15.  Og jeg sagde: Hvem er du, Herre? Men Herren sagde: Jeg er Jesus,
      som du forfølger.
 16.  Men rejs dig og stå på dine Fødder; thi derfor har jeg vist mig
      for dig, for at udkåre dig til Tjener og Vidne, både om det, som
      du har set, og om mine kommende Åbenbaringer for dig,
 17.  idet jeg udfrier dig fra Folket og fra Hedningerne, til hvilke
      jeg udsender dig
 18.  for at oplade deres Øjne, så de må omvende sig fra Mørke til Lys
      og fra Satans Magt til Gud, for at de kunne få Syndernes
      Forladelse og Lod iblandt dem, som ere helligede ved Troen på
      mig.
 19.  Derfor, Kong Agrippa! blev jeg ikke ulydig imod det himmelske
      Syn;
 20.  men jeg forkyndte både først for dem i Damaskus og så i
      Jerusalem og over hele Judæas Land og for Hedningerne, at de
      skulde fatte et andet Sind og omvende sig til Gud og gøre
      Gerninger, Omvendelsen værdige.
 21.  For denne Sags Skyld grebe nogle Jøder mig i Helligdommen og
      forsøgte at slå mig ihjel.
 22.  Det er altså ved den Hjælp, jeg har fået fra Gud, at jeg har
      stået indtil denne Dag og vidnet både for små og store, idet jeg
      intet siger ud over det, som både Profeterne og Moses have sagt
      skulde ske,
 23.  at Kristus skulde lide, at han som den første af de dødes
      Opstandelse skulde forkynde Lys både for Folket og for
      Hedningerne."
 24.  Men da han forsvarede sig således, sagde Festus med høj Røst:
      "Du raser, Paulus! den megen Lærdom gør dig rasende."
 25.  Men Paulus sagde: "Jeg raser ikke, mægtigste Festus! men jeg
      taler sande og betænksomme Ord.
 26.  Thi Kongen ved Besked om dette, og til ham taler jeg frimodigt,
      efterdi jeg er vis på, at slet intet af dette er skjult for ham;
      thi dette er ikke sket i en Vrå.
 27.  Tror du, Kong Agrippa, Profeterne? Jeg ved, at du tror dem."
 28.  Men Agrippa sagde til Paulus: "Der fattes lidet i, at du
      overtaler mig til at blive en Kristen."
 29.  Men Paulus sagde: "Jeg vilde ønske til Gud, enten der fattes
      lidet eller meget, at ikke alene du, men også alle, som høre mig
      i Dag, måtte blive sådan, som jeg selv er, på disse Lænker nær."
 30.  Da stod Kongen op og Landshøvdingen og Berenike og de, som sade
      hos dem.
 31.  Og da de gik bort, talte de med hverandre og sagde: "Denne Mand
      gør intet, som fortjener Død eller Lænker."
 32.  Men Agrippa sagde til Festus: "Denne Mand kunde være løsladt,
      dersom han ikke havde skudt sig ind under Kejseren."

Apostelenes gerninger 27

  1.  Men da det var besluttet, at vi skulde afsejle til Italien,
      overgave de både Paulus og nogle andre Fanger til en Høvedsmand
      ved Navn Julius af den kejserlige Afdeling.
  2.  Vi gik da om Bord på et adramyttisk Skib, som skulde gå til
      Stederne langs med Asiens Kyster, og vi sejlede af Sted; og
      Aristarkus, en Makedonier fra Thessalonika, var med os.
  3.  Og den næste Dag anløb vi Sidon. Og Julius, som behandlede
      Paulus venligt. tilstedte ham at gå hen til sine Venner og nyde
      Pleje.
  4.  Og vi fore bort derfra og sejlede ind under Kypern, fordi Vinden
      var imod.
  5.  Og vi sejlede igennem Farvandet ved Kilikien og Pamfylien og kom
      til Myra i Lykien.
  6.  Og der fandt Høvedsmanden et aleksandrinsk Skib, som sejlede til
      Italien, og bragte os over i det.
  7.  Men da Sejladsen i mange Dage gik langsomt, og vi med Nød og
      næppe nåede henimod Knidus (thi Vinden føjede os ikke), holdt vi
      ned under Kreta ved Salmone.
  8.  Med Nød og næppe sejlede vi der forbi og kom til et Sted, som
      kaldes "Gode Havne", nær ved Byen Lasæa.
  9.  Men da en rum Tid var forløben, og Sejladsen allerede var
      farlig, såsom endog Fasten allerede var forbi, formanede Paulus
      dem og sagde:
 10.  "I Mænd! jeg ser, at Sejladsen vil medføre Ulykke og megen
      Skade, ikke alene på Ladning og Skib, men også på vort Liv."
 11.  Men Høvedsmanden stolede mere på Styrmanden og Skipperen end på
      det, som Paulus sagde.
 12.  Og da Havnen ikke egnede sig til Vinterleje, besluttede de
      fleste, at man skulde sejle derfra, om man muligt kunde nå hen
      og overvintre i Føniks, en Havn på Kreta, som vender imod
      Sydvest og Nordvest,
 13.  Da der nu blæste en Sønden: vind op, mente de at have nået deres
      Hensigt, lettede Anker og sejlede langs med og nærmere ind under
      Kreta.
 14.  Men ikke længe derefter for der en heftig Storm ned over den,
      den såkaldte "Eurakvilo".
 15.  Og da Skibet reves med og ikke kunde holde op imod Vinden,
      opgave vi det og lode os drive.
 16.  Men da vi løb ind under en lille Ø, som kaldes Klavde, formåede
      vi med Nød og næppe at bjærge Båden.
 17.  Men efter at have trukket den op, anvendte de Nødmidler og
      omsurrede Skibet; og da de frygtede for, at de skulde blive
      kastede ned i Syrten, firede de Sejlene ned og lode sig således
      drive.
 18.  Og da vi måtte kæmpe hårdt med Stormen, begyndte de næste Dag at
      kaste over Bord.
 19.  Og på den tredje Dag udkastede de med egne Hænder Skibets
      Redskaber.
 20.  Men da hverken Sol eller Stjerner lode sig se i flere Dage, og
      vi havde et Uvejr over os; som ikke var ringe, blev fra nu af
      alt Håb om Redning os betaget.
 21.  Og da man længe ikke havde taget Føde til sig, så stod Paulus
      frem midt iblandt dem og sagde: "I Mænd! man burde have adlydt
      mig og ikke været sejlet bort fra Kreta og have sparet os denne
      Ulykke og Skade.
 22.  Og nu formaner jeg eder til at være ved godt Mod; thi ingen Sjæl
      af eder skal forgå, men alene Skibet.
 23.  Thi i denne Nat stod der en Engel hos mig fra den Gud, hvem jeg
      tilhører, hvem jeg også tjener, og sagde:
 24.  "Frygt ikke, Paulus! du skal blive stillet for Kejseren; og
      se,Gud har skænket dig alle dem, som sejle med dig."
 25.  Derfor, I Mænd! værer ved godt Mod; thi jeg har den Tillid til
      Gud, at det skal ske således, som der er blevet talt til mig.
 26.  Men vi må strande på en Ø."
 27.  Men da den fjortende Nat kom, og vi dreve i det adriatiske Hav,
      kom det Skibsfolkene for ved Midnatstid, at der var Land i
      Nærheden.
 28.  Og da de loddede, fik de tyve Favne, og da de lidt længere
      fremme atter loddede, fik de femten Favne.
 29.  Og da de frygtede, at vi skulde støde på Skær, kastede de fire
      Ankre ud fra Bagstavnen og bade til, at det måtte blive Dag.
 30.  Men da Skibsfolkene gjorde Forsøg på at flygte fra Skibet og
      firede Båden ned i Søen under Påskud af, at de vilde lægge Ankre
      ud fra Forstavnen,
 31.  da sagde Paulus til Høvedsmanden og til Stridsmændene: "Dersom
      disse ikke blive i Skibet, kunne I ikke reddes."
 32.  Da kappede Stridsmændene Bådens Tove og lode den falde ned.
 33.  Men indtil det vilde dages, formanede Paulus alle til at tage
      Næring til sig og sagde: "Det er i Dag den fjortende Dag, I have
      ventet og tilbragt uden at spise og intet taget til eder.
 34.  Derfor formaner jeg eder til at tage Næring til eder, thi dette
      hører med til eders Redning; ikke et Hår på Hovedet skal gå tabt
      for nogen af eder."
 35.  Men da han havde sagt dette, tog han Brød og takkede Gud for
      alles Øjne og brød det og begyndte at spise.
 36.  Da bleve de alle frimodige og toge også Næring til sig.
 37.  Men vi vare i Skibet i alt to Hundrede og seks og
      halvfjerdsindstyve Sjæle.
 38.  Og da de vare blevne mættede med Føde, lettede de Skibet ved at
      kaste Levnedsmidlerne i Søen.
 39.  Men da det blev Dag, kendte de ikke Landet; men de bemærkede en
      Vig med en Forstrand, som de besluttede, om muligt, at sætte
      Skibet ind på.
 40.  Og de kappede Ankrene, som de lode blive i Søen, og løste
      tillige Rortovene, og idet de satte Råsejlet til for Vinden,
      holdt de ind på Strandbredden.
 41.  Men de stødte på en Grund med dybt Vand på begge Sider, og der
      satte de Skibet, og Forstavnen borede sig fast og stod
      urokkelig, men Bagstavnen sloges sønder af Bølgernes Magt.
 42.  Det var nu Stridsmændenes Råd, at man skulde ihjelslå Fangerne,
      for at ingen skulde svømme bort og undkomme.
 43.  Men Høvedsmanden, som vilde frelse Paulus, forhindrede dem i
      dette Forehavende og bød, at de, som kunde svømme, skulde først
      kaste sig ud og slippe i Land,
 44.  og de andre bjærge sig, nogle på Brædder, andre på Stykker af
      Skibet. Og således skete det, at alle bleve reddede i Land.

Apostelenes gerninger 28

  1.  Og da vi nu vare reddede, så fik vi at vide, at Øen hed Malta.
  2.  Og Barbarerne viste os en usædvanlig Menneskekærlighed; thi de
      tændte et Bål og toge sig af os alle for den frembrydende Regns
      og Kuldens Skyld.
  3.  Men da Paulus samlede en Bunke Ris og lagde på Bålet, krøb der
      en Øgle ud på Grund af Varmen og hængte sig fast ved hans Hånd.
  4.  Da nu Barbarerne så Dyret hænge ved hans Hånd, sagde de til
      hverandre: "Sikkert er denne Mand en Morder, hvem Gengældelsen
      ikke har tilstedt at leve, skønt han er reddet fra Havet."
  5.  Men han rystede Dyret af i Ilden, og der skete ham intet ondt.
  6.  Men de ventede, at han skulde hovne op eller pludseligt falde
      død om. Men da de havde ventet længe og så, at der ikke skete
      ham noget usædvanligt, kom de på andre Tanker og sagde, at han
      var en Gud.
  7.  Men i Omegnen af dette Sted havde Øens fornemste Mand, ved Navn
      Publius, nogle Landejendomme. Han tog imod os og lånte os
      venligt Herberge i tre Dage.
  8.  Men det traf sig, at Publius's Fader lå syg af Feber og
      Blodgang.  Til ham gik Paulus ind og bad og lagde Hænderne på
      ham og helbredte ham.
  9.  Da dette var sket, kom også de andre på Øen, som havde Sygdomme,
      til ham og bleve helbredte.
 10.  De viste os også megen Ære, og da vi sejlede bort, bragte de om
      Bord i Skibet, hvad vi trængte til.

 11.  Men efter tre Måneders Forløb sejlede vi da bort i et
      aleksandrinsk Skib, som havde haft Vinterleje ved Øen og førte
      Tvillingernes Mærke.
 12.  Og vi løb ind til Syrakus, hvor vi bleve tre Dage.
 13.  Derfra sejlede vi videre og kom til Regium, og efter en Dags
      Forløb fik vi Søndenvind og kom den næste Dag til Puteoli.
 14.  Der fandt vi Brødre og bleve opfordrede til at blive hos dem i
      syv Dage. Og så droge vi til Rom.
 15.  Og Brødrene derfra, som havde hørt om os, kom os i Møde til
      Appius's Forum og Tres-Tabernæ. Og da Paulus så dem, takkede han
      Gud og fattede Mod.
 16.  Men da vi kom til Rom, (overgav Høvedsmanden Fangerne til
      Høvdingen for Livvagten. Dog) blev det tilstedt Paulus at bo for
      sig selv sammen med den Stridsmand, der bevogtede ham.

 17.  Men efter tre Dages Forløb skete det, at han sammenkaldt de
      fornemste iblandt Jøderne. Men da de vare forsamlede, sagde han
      til dem: "I Mænd, Brødre! uagtet jeg intet har gjort imod vort
      Folk eller de fædrene Skikke, er jeg fra Jerusalem overgiven som
      Fange i Romernes Hænder,
 18.  og disse vilde efter at have forhørt mig løslade mig, efterdi
      der ikke var nogen Dødsskyld hos mig.
 19.  Men da Jøderne gjorde Indsigelse, nødtes jeg til at skyde mig
      ind under Kejseren, dog ikke, som om jeg havde noget at anklage
      mit Folk for.
 20.  Af denne Årsag har jeg altså ladet eder kalde hid for at se og
      tale med eder; thi for Israels Håbs Skyld er jeg sluttet i denne
      Lænke."
 21.  Men de sagde til ham: "Hverken have vi fået Brev fra Judæa om
      dig, ikke heller er nogen af Brødrene kommen og har meddelt
      eller sagt noget ondt om dig.
 22.  Men vi ønske at høre af dig, hvad du tænker; thi om dette Parti
      er det os bekendt, at det alle Vegne finder Modsigelse."
 23.  Efter så at have aftalt en Dag med ham, kom de til ham i
      Herberget i større Tal, og for dem forklarede han og vidnede om
      Guds Rige og søgte at overbevise dem om Jesus, både ud af Mose
      Lov og af Profeterne, fra årle om Morgenen indtil Aften.
 24.  Og nogle lode sig overbevise af det, som blev sagt, men andre
      troede ikke.
 25.  Og under indbyrdes Uenighed gik de bort, da Paulus havde sagt
      dette ene Ord: "Rettelig har den Helligånd talt ved Profeten
      Esajas til eders Fædre og sagt:
 26.  "Gå hen til dette Folk og sig: I skulle høre med eders Øren og
      ikke forstå og se med eders Øjne og ikke se;
 27.  thi dette Folks Hjerte er blevet sløvet, og med Ørene høre de
      tungt, og deres Øjne have de tillukket, for at de ikke skulle se
      med Øjnene og høre med Ørene og forstå med Hjertet og omvende
      sig, så jeg kunde helbrede dem."
 28.  Derfor være det eder vitterligt, at denne Guds Frelse er sendt
      til Hedningerne; de skulle også høre."
 29.  Og da han havde sagt dette, gik Jøderne bort, og der var stor
      Trætte imellem dem indbyrdes.
 30.  Men han blev hele to År i sit lejede Herberge og modtog alle,
      som kom til ham,
 31.  idet han prædikede Guds Rige og lærte om den Herre Jesus med al
      Frimodighed, uhindret.


Romerne

Romerne 1

  1.  Paulus, Jesu Kristi Tjener, Apostel ifølge Kald, udtagen til at
      forkynde Guds Evangelium,
  2.  hvilket han forud forjættede ved sine Profeter i hellige
      Skrifter,
  3.  om hans Søn, født af Davids Sæd efter Kødet,
  4.  kraftelig bevist som Guds Søn efter Helligheds Ånd ved
      Opstandelse fra de døde, Jesus Kristus, vor Herre,
  5.  ved hvem vi have fået Nåde og Apostelgerning til at virke
      Tros-Lydighed iblandt alle Hedningerne for hans Navns Skyld,
  6.  iblandt hvilke også I ere Jesu Kristi kaldede:
  7.  Til alle Guds elskede, som ere i Rom, kaldede hellige. Nåde være
      med eder og Fred fra Gud vor Fader og den Herre Jesus Kristus!

  8.  Først takker jeg min Gud ved Jesus Kristus for eder alle, fordi
      eders Tro omtales i den hele Verden.
  9.  Thi Gud er mit Vidne, hvem jeg i min Ånd tjener i hans Søns
      Evangelium, hvor uafladeligt jeg kommer eder i Hu,
 10.  idet jeg bestandig i mine Bønner beder om, at jeg dog endelig
      engang måtte få Lykke til Ved Guds Villie at komme til eder.
 11.  Thi jeg længes efter at se eder, for at jeg kunde meddele eder
      nogen åndelig Nådegave, for at I måtte styrkes,
 12.  det vil sige, for sammen at opmuntres hos eder ved hinandens
      Tro, både eders og min.
 13.  Og jeg vil ikke, Brødre! at I skulle være uvidende om, at jeg
      ofte har sat mig for at komme til eder (men hidindtil er jeg
      bleven forhindret), for at jeg måtte få nogen Frugt også iblandt
      eder, ligesom iblandt de øvrige Hedninger.
 14.  Både til Grækere og Barbarer, både til vise og uforstandige står
      jeg i Gæld.
 15.  således er jeg, hvad mig angår, redebon til at forkynde
      Evangeliet også for eder, som ere i Rom.
 16.  Thi jeg skammer mig ikke ved Evangeliet; thi det er en Guds
      Kraft til Frelse for hver den, som tror, både for Jøde først og
      for Græker.
 17.  Thi deri åbenbares Guds Retfærdighed af Tro for Tro, som der er
      skrevet: "Men den retfærdige skal leve af Tro."

 18.  Thi Guds Vrede åbenbares fra Himmelen over al Ugudelighed og
      Uretfærdighed hos Mennesker, som holde Sandheden nede ved
      Uretfærdighed;
 19.  thi det, som man kan vide om Gud, er åbenbart iblandt dem; Gud
      har jo åbenbaret dem det.
 20.  Thi hans usynlige Væsen, både hans evige Kraft og
      Guddommelighed, skues fra Verdens Skabelse af, idet det forstås
      af hans Gerninger, så at de have ingen Undskyldning.
 21.  Thi skønt de kendte Gud, så ærede eller takkede de ham dog ikke
      som Gud, men bleve tåbelige i deres Tanker, og deres
      uforstandige Hjerte blev formørket.
 22.  Idet de påstode at være vise, bleve de Dårer
 23.  og omskiftede den uforkrænkelige Guds Herlighed med et Billede i
      Lighed med et forkrænkeligt Menneske og Fugle og firføddede og
      krybende dyr.

 24.  Derfor gav Gud dem hen i deres Hjerters Begæringer til Urenhed,
      til at vanære deres Legemer indbyrdes,
 25.  de, som ombyttede Guds Sandhed med Løgnen og dyrkede og tjente
      Skabningen fremfor Skaberen, som er højlovet i Evighed! Amen.
 26.  Derfor gav Gud dem hen i vanærende Lidenskaber; thi både deres
      Kvinder ombyttede den naturlige Omgang med den unaturlige,
 27.  og ligeså forlode også Mændene den naturlige Omgang med Kvinden
      og optændtes ideres Brynde efter hverandre, så at Mænd øvede
      Uterlighed med Mænd og fik deres Vildfarelses Løn, som det burde
      sig, på sig selv.
 28.  Og ligesom de forkastede af have Gud i Erkendelse, således gav
      Gud dem hen i et forkasteligt Sind til at gøre det usømmelige,
 29.  opfyldte med al Uretfærdighed, Ondskab, Havesyge, Slethed; fulde
      af Avind, Mord, Kiv, Svig, Ondsindethed;
 30.  Øretudere, Bagvaskere, Gudshadere, Voldsmænd, hovmodige;
      Pralere, opfindsomme på ondt, ulydige mod Forældre,
 31.  uforstandige, troløse, ukærlige, ubarmhjertige;
 32.  - hvilke jo, skønt de erkende Guds retfærdige Dom, at de, der
      øve sådanne Ting, fortjene Døden, dog ikke alene gøre det, men
      også give dem, som øve det, deres Bifald.

Romerne 2

  1.  Derfor er du uden Undskyldning, o Menneske! hvem du end er, som
      dømmer; thi idet du dømmer den anden, fordømmer du dig selv; thi
      du, som dømmer, øver det samme.
  2.  Vi vide jo, at Guds Dom er, stemmende med Sandhed, over dem, som
      øve sådanne Ting.
  3.  Men du, o Menneske! som dømmer dem, der øve sådanne Ting, og
      selv gør dem, mener du dette, at du skal undfly Guds Dom?
  4.  Eller foragter du hans Godheds og Tålmodigheds og Langmodigheds
      Rigdom og ved ikke, at Guds Godhed leder dig til Omvendelse?
  5.  Men efter din Hårdhed og dit ubodfærdige Hjerte samler du dig
      selv Vrede på Vredens og Guds retfærdige Doms Åbenbarelses Dag,
  6.  han, som vil betale enhver efter hans Gerninger:
  7.  dem, som med Udholdenhed i god Gerning søge Ære og Hæder og
      Uforkrænkelighed, et evigt Liv;
  8.  men over dem, som søge deres eget og ikke lyde Sandheden, men
      adlyde Uretfærdigheden, skal der komme Vrede og Harme.
  9.  Trængsel og Angst over hvert Menneskes Sjæl, som øver det onde,
      både en Jødes først og en Grækers;
 10.  men Ære og Hæder og Fred over hver den, som gør det gode, både
      en Jøde først og en Græker!

 11.  Thi der er ikke Persons Anseelse hos Gud.
 12.  Thi alle de, som have syndet uden Loven, de skulle også fortabes
      uden Loven; og alle de, som have syndet under Loven, de skulle
      dømmes ved Loven;
 13.  thi ikke Lovens Hørere ere retfærdige for Gud, men Lovens Gørere
      skulle retfærdiggøres
 14.  thi når Hedninger, som ikke have Loven, af Naturen gøre, hvad
      Loven kræver, da ere disse; uden at have Loven sig selv en Lov;
 15.  de vise jo Lovens Gerning skreven i deres Hjerter, idet deres
      Samvittighed vidner med, og Tankerne indbyrdes anklage eller
      også forsvare hverandre
 16.  på den Dag, da Gud vil dømme Menneskenes skjulte Færd ifølge mit
      Evangelium ved Jesus Kristus.
 17.  Men når du kalder dig Jøde og forlader dig trygt på Loven og
      roser dig af Gud
 18.  og kender hans Villie og værdsætter de forskellige Ting, idet du
      undervises af Loven,
 19.  og trøster dig til at være blindes Vejleder, et Lys for dem, som
      ere i Mørke,
 20.  uforstandiges Opdrager, umyndiges Lærer, idet du i Loven har
      Udtrykket for Erkendelsen og Sandheden,
 21.  du altså som lærer andre, du lærer ikke dig selv! Du, som
      prædiker, at man ikke må stjæle, du stjæler!.
 22.  Du, som siger, at man ikke må bedrive Hor, du bedriver Hor! Du,
      som føler Afsky for Afguderne, du øver Tempelran!
 23.  Du, som roser dig af Loven, du vanærer Gud ved Overtrædelse af
      Loven!
 24.  Thi "for eders Skyld bespottes Guds Navn iblandt Hedningerne",
      som der er skrevet.

 25.  Thi vel gavner Omskærelse, om du holder Loven; men er du Lovens
      Overtræder, da er din Omskærelse bleven til Forhud.
 26.  Dersom nu Forhuden holder Lovens Forskrifter, vil da ikke hans
      Forhud blive regnet som Omskærelse?
 27.  Og når den af Natur uomskårne opfylder Loven, skal han dømme
      dig, som med Bogstav og Omskærelse er Lovens Overtræder.
 28.  Thi ikke den er Jøde, som er det i det udvortes, ej heller er det
      Omskærelse, som sker i det udvortes, i Kød;
 29.  men den, som indvortes er Jøde, og Hjertets Omskærelse i Ånd,
      ikke i Bogstav - hans Ros er ikke af Mennesker, men af Gud,

Romerne 3

  1.  Hvad er da Jødens Fortrin? eller hvad gavner Omskærelsen?
  2.  Meget alle Måder; først nemlig dette, at Guds Ord ere blevne dem
      betroede.
  3.  Thi hvad? om nogle vare utro, skal da deres Utroskab gøre Guds
      Trofasthed til intet?
  4.  Det være langt fra! Gud må være sanddru, om end hvert Menneske
      er en Løgner, som der er skrevet: "For at du må kendes retfærdig
      i dine Ord og vinde, når du går i Rette."
  5.  Men dersom vor Uretfærdighed beviser Guds Retfærdighed, hvad
      skulle vi da sige? er Gud da uretfærdig, han, som lader sin
      Vrede komme? (Jeg taler efter menneskelig Vis).
  6.  Det være langt fra! Thi hvorledes skal Gud ellers kunne dømme
      Verden?
  7.  Men dersom Guds Sanddruhed ved min Løgn er bleven ham end mere
      til Forherligelse, hvorfor dømmes da jeg endnu som en Synder?
  8.  Og hvorfor skulde vi da ikke, som man bagvasker os for, og som
      nogle sige, at vi lære, gøre det onde, for at det gode kan komme
      deraf? Sådannes Dom er velforskyldt.

  9.  Hvad da? have vi noget forud? Aldeles ikke; vi have jo ovenfor
      anklaget både Jøder og Grækere for alle at være under Synd,
 10.  som der er skrevet: "Der er ingen retfærdig, end ikke een;
 11.  der er ingen forstandig, der er ingen, som søger efter Gud;
 12.  alle ere afvegne, til Hobe ere de blevne uduelige, der er ingen,
      som øver Godhed, der er end ikke een."
 13.  "En åbnet Grav er deres Strube; med deres Tunger øvede de Svig;"
      "der er Slangegift under deres Læber;"
 14.  "deres Mund er fuld af Forbandelse og Beskhed;"
 15.  "rappe ere deres Fødder til at udøse Blod;
 16.  der er Ødelæggelse og Elendighed på deres Veje,
 17.  og Freds Vej have de ikke kendt."
 18.  "Der er ikke Gudsfrygt for deres Øjne."
 19.  Men vi vide, at alt, hvad Loven siger, taler den til dem, som
      ere under Loven, for at hver Mund skal stoppes og hele Verden
      blive strafskyldig for Gud,
 20.  efterdi intet Kød vil blive retfærdiggjort for ham af Lovens
      Gerninger; thi ved Loven kommer Erkendelse af Synd.

 21.  Men nu er uden Lov Guds Retfærdighed åbenbaret, om hvilken der
      vidnes af Loven og Profeterne.
 22.  nemlig Guds Retfærdighed ved Tro på Jesus Kristus, for alle og
      over alle dem, som tro; thi der er ikke Forskel.
 23.  Alle have jo syndet, og dem fattes Æren fra Gud,
 24.  og de blive retfærdiggjorte uforskyldt af hans Nåde ved den
      Forløsning, som er i Kristus Jesus,
 25.  hvem Gud fremstillede som Sonemiddel ved Troen på hans Blod for
      at vise sin Retfærdighed, fordi Gud i sin Langmodighed havde
      båret over med de forhen begåede Synder,
 26.  for at vise sin Retfærdighed i den nærværende Tid, for at han
      kunde være retfærdig og retfærdiggøre den, som er af Tro på
      Jesus.

 27.  Hvor er så vor Ros? Den er udelukket. Ved hvilken Lov?
      Gerningernes? Nej, men ved Troens Lov.
 28.  Vi holde nemlig for, at Mennesket bliver retfærdiggjort ved Tro,
      uden Lovens Gerninger.
 29.  Eller er Gud alene Jøders Gud? mon ikke også Hedningers? Jo,
      også Hedningers;
 30.  så sandt som Gud er een og vil retfærdiggøre omskårne af Tro og
      uomskårne ved Troen.
 31.  Gøre vi da Loven til intet ved Troen? Det være langt fra! Nej,
      vi hævde Loven.

Romerne 4

  1.  Hvad skulle vi da sige, at vor Stamfader Abraham har vundet
      efter Kødet?
  2.  Thi dersom Abraham blev retfærdiggjort af Gerninger, har han
      Ros, men ikke for Gud.
  3.  Thi hvad siger Skriften?"Og Abraham troede Gud, og det blev
      regnet ham til Retfærdighed."
  4.  Men den, som gør Gerninger, tilregnes Lønnen ikke som Nåde, men
      som Skyldighed;
  5.  den derimod, som ikke gør Gerninger, men tror på ham, som
      retfærdiggør den ugudelige, regnes hans Tro til Retfærdighed;
  6.  ligesom også David priser det Menneske saligt, hvem Gud
      tilregner Retfærdighed uden Gerninger:
  7.  "Salige de, hvis Overtrædelser ere forladte, og hvis Synder ere
      skjulte;
  8.  salig den Mand, hvem Herren ikke vil tilregne Synd."

  9.  Gælder da denne Saligprisning de omskårne eller tillige de
      uomskårne? Vi sige jo: Troen blev regnet Abraham til
      Retfærdighed.
 10.  Hvorledes blev den ham da tilregnet? da han var omskåren, eller
      da han havde Forhud? Ikke da han var omskåren, men da han havde
      Forhud.
 11.  Og han fik Omskærelsens Tegn som et Segl på den Troens
      Retfærdighed, som han havde som uomskåren, for at han skulde
      være Fader til alle dem, som tro uden at være omskårne, for at
      Retfærdighed kan blive dem tilregnet,
 12.  og Fader til omskårne,til dem, som ikke alene have Omskærelse,
      men også vandre i den Tros Spor, hvilken vor Fader Abraham havde
      som uomskåren.

 13.  Thi ikke ved Lov fik Abraham eller hans Sæd den Forjættelse, at
      han skulde være Arving til Verden, men ved Tros-Retfærdighed.
 14.  Thi dersom de, der ere af Loven, ere Arvinger, da er Troen
      bleven tom, og Forjættelsen gjort til intet.
 15.  Thi Loven virker Vrede; men hvor der ikke er Lov, er der heller
      ikke Overtrædelse.
 16.  Derfor er det af Tro, for at det skal være som Nåde, for at
      Forjættelsen må stå fast for den hele Sæd, ikke alene for den af
      Loven, men også for den af Abrahams Tro, han, som er Fader til
      os alle
 17.  (som der er skrevet: "Jeg har sat dig til mange Folkeslags
      Fader"), over for Gud, hvem han troede, ham, som levendegør de
      døde og kalder det, der ikke er, som om det var.
 18.  Og han troede imod Håb med Håb på, at, han skulde blive mange
      Folkeslags Fader, efter det, som var sagt: "Således skal din Sæd
      være;"
 19.  og uden at blive svag i Troen så han på sit eget allerede
      udlevede Legeme (han var nær hundrede År) og på, at Saras
      Moderliv var udlevet;
 20.  men om Guds Forjættelse tvivlede han ikke i Vantro, derimod blev
      han styrket i Troen, idet han gav Gud Ære
 21.  og var overbevist om, at hvad han har forjættet, er han mægtig
      til også at gøre.
 22.  Derfor blev det også regnet ham til Retfærdighed.
 23.  Men det blev, ikke skrevet for hans Skyld alene, at det blev ham
      tilregnet,
 24.  men også for vor Skyld, hvem det skal tilregnes, os, som tro på
      ham, der oprejste Jesus, vor Herre, fra de døde,
 25.  ham, som blev hengiven for vore Overtrædelsers Skyld og oprejst
      for vor Retfærdiggørelses Skyld.

Romerne 5

  1.  Altså retfærdiggjorte af Tro have vi Fred med Gud ved vor Herre
      Jesus Krist,
  2.  ved hvem vi også have fået Adgang ved Troen til denne Nåde,
      hvori vi stå, og vi rose os af Håb om Guds Herlighed;
  3.  ja, ikke det alene, men vi rose os også af Trængslerne, idet vi
      vide, at Trængselen virker Udholdenhed,
  4.  men Udholdenheden Prøvethed, men Prøvetheden Håb,
  5.  men Håbet beskæmmer ikke; thi Guds Kærlighed er udøst i vore
      Hjerter ved den Helligånd, som blev given os.
  6.  Thi medens vi endnu vare kraftesløse, døde Kristus til den
      bestemte Tid for ugudelige.
  7.  Næppe vil nemlig nogen dø for en retfærdig - for den gode var
      der jo måske nogen, som tog sig på at dø -,
  8.  men Gud beviser sin Kærlighed over for os, ved at Kristus døde
      for os, medens vi endnu vare Syndere.
  9.  Så meget mere skulle vi altså, da vi nu ere blevne
      retfærdiggjorte ved hans Blod, frelses ved ham fra Vreden.
 10.  Thi når vi, da vi vare Fjender, bleve forligte med Gud ved hans
      Søns Død, da skulle vi meget mere, efter at vi ere blevne
      forligte, frelses ved hans Liv,
 11.  ja, ikke det alene, men også således, at vi rose os af Gud ved
      vor Herre Jesus Kristus, ved hvem vi nu have fået Forligelsen.

 12.  Derfor, ligesom Synden kom ind i Verden ved eet Menneske, og
      Døden ved Synden, og Døden således trængte igennem til alle
      Mennesker, efterdi de syndede alle
 13.  thi inden Loven var der Synd i Verden; men Synd tilregnes ikke.
      hvor der ikke er Lov;
 14.  dog herskede Døden fra Adam til Moses også over dem, som ikke
      syndede i Lighed med Adams Overtrædelse, han, som er et
      Forbillede på den, der skulde komme.
 15.  Men det er ikke således med Nådegaven som med Faldet; thi døde
      de mange ved den enes Fald, da har meget mere Guds Nåde og Gaven
      i det ene Menneskes Jesu Kristi Nåde udbredt sig overflødig, til
      de mange.
 16.  Og Gaven er ikke som igennem en enkelt, der syndede; thi Dommen
      blev ud fra en enkelt til Fordømmelse, men Nådegaven blev ud fra
      mange Fald til Retfærdiggørelse.
 17.  Thi når på Grund af dennes Fald Døden herskede ved den ene, da
      skulle meget mere de, som modtage den overvættes Nåde og
      Retfærdigheds Gave, herske i Liv ved den ene, Jesus Kristus.
 18.  Altså, ligesom det ved eens Fald blev for alle Mennesker til
      Fordømmelse, således også ved eens Retfærdighed for alle
      Mennesker til Retfærdiggørelse til Liv.
 19.  Thi ligesom ved det ene Menneskes Ulydighed de mange bleve til
      Syndere, så skulle også ved den enes Lydighed de mange blive til
      retfærdige.

 20.  Men Loven kom til, for at Faldet kunde blive større; men hvor
      Synden blev større, der blev Nåden end mere overvættes,
 21.  for at, ligesom Synden herskede ved Døden, således også Nåden
      skulde herske ved Retfærdighed til et evigt Liv ved Jesus
      Kristus, vor Herre.

Romerne 6

  1.  Hvad skulle vi da sige? skulde vi blive ved i Synden, for at
      Nåden kunde blive desto større?
  2.  Det være langt fra! Vi, som jo ere døde fra Synden, hvorledes
      skulle vi endnu leve i den?
  3.  Eller vide I ikke, at vi, så mange som bleve døbte til Kristus
      Jesus, bleve døbte til hans Død?
  4.  Vi bleve altså begravne med ham ved Dåben til Døden, for at,
      ligesom Kristus blev oprejst fra de døde ved Faderens Herlighed,
      således også vi skulle vandre i et nyt Levned.
  5.  Thi ere vi blevne sammenvoksede med ham ved hans Døds Afbillede,
      skulle vi dog også være det ved hans Opstandelses,
  6.  idet vi erkende dette, at vort gamle Menneske blev korsfæstet
      med ham, for at Syndens Legeme skulde blive til intet, for at vi
      ikke mere skulde tjene Synden.
  7.  Thi den, som er død, er retfærdiggjort fra Synden.
  8.  Men dersom vi ere døde med Kristus, da tro vi, at vi også skulle
      leve med ham,
  9.  efterdi vi vide, at Kristus, efter at være oprejst fra de døde,
      ikke mere dør; Døden hersker ikke mere over ham.
 10.  Thi det, han døde, døde han een Gang fra Synden; men det, han
      lever, lever han for Gud.
 11.  Således skulle også I anse eder selv for døde fra Synden, men
      levende for Gud i Kristus Jesus.
 12.  Så lad da ikke Synden herske i eders dødelige Legeme, så I lyde
      dets Begæringer;
 13.  fremstiller ej heller eders Lemmer for Synden som Uretfærdigheds
      Våben; men fremstiller eder selv for Gud som sådanne, der fra
      døde ere blevne levende,og eders Lemmer som Retfærdigheds Våben
      for Gud.
 14.  Thi Synd skal ikke herske over eder I ere jo ikke under Lov, men
      under Nåde.

 15.  Hvad da? skulde vi Synde, fordi vi ikke ere under Lov, men under
      Nåde? Det være langt fra!
 16.  Vide I ikke, at når I fremstille eder for en som Tjenere til
      Lydighed, så ere I hans Tjenere, hvem I lyde, enten Syndens til
      Død, eller Lydighedens til Retfærdighed?
 17.  Men Gud ske Tak, fordi I have været Syndens Tjenere, men bleve
      af Hjertet lydige imod den Læreform, til hvilken I bleve
      overgivne.
 18.  Og frigjorde fra Synden bleve I Retfærdighedens Tjenere.
 19.  Jeg taler på menneskelig Vis på Grund af eders Køds
      Skrøbelighed. Ligesom I nemlig fremstillede eders Lemmer som
      Tjenere for Urenheden og Lovløsheden til Lovløshed, således
      fremstiller nu eders Lemmer som Tjenere for Retfærdigheden, til
      Helliggørelse!
 20.  Thi da I vare Syndens Tjenere, vare I frie over for
      Retfærdigheden.
 21.  Hvad for Frugt havde I da dengang? Ting, ved hvilke I nu skamme
      eder; Enden derpå er jo Død.
 22.  Men nu, da I ere blevne frigjorde fra Synden og ere blevne Guds
      Tjenere, have I eders Frugt til Helliggørelse og som Enden derpå
      et evigt Liv;
 23.  thi Syndens Sold er Død, men Guds Nådegave er et evigt Liv i
      Kristus Jesus, vor Herre.

Romerne 7

  1.  Eller vide I ikke, Brødre! (thi jeg taler til sådanne, som
      kender Loven) at Loven hersker over Mennesket, så lang Tid han
      lever?
  2.  Den gifte Kvinde er jo ved Loven bunden til sin Mand, medens han
      lever; men når Manden dør, er hun løst fra Mandens Lov.
  3.  Derfor skal hun kaldes en Horkvinde, om hun bliver en anden
      Mands, medens Manden lever: men når Manden dør, er hun fri fra
      den Lov, så at hun ikke er en Horkvinde, om hun bliver en anden
      Mands.
  4.  Altså ere også I, mine Brødre! gjorte døde for Loven ved Kristi
      Legeme, for at I skulle blive en andens, hans, som blev oprejst
      fra de døde, for at vi skulle bære Frugt for Gud.
  5.  Thi da vi vare i Kødet, vare de syndige Lidenskaber, som vaktes
      ved Loven, virksomme i vore Lemmer til at bære Frugt for Døden,
  6.  Men nu ere vi løste fra Loven, idet vi ere bortdøde fra det,
      hvori vi holdtes nede, så at vi tjene i Åndens nye Væsen og ikke
      i Bogstavens gamle Væsen.

  7.  Hvad skulle vi da sige? er Loven Synd? Det være langt fra! Men
      jeg kendte ikke Synden uden ved Loven; thi jeg kendte jo ikke
      Begæringen, hvis ikke Loven sagde: "Du må ikke begære."
  8.  Men da Synden fik Anledning, virkede den ved Budet al Begæring i
      mig; thi uden Lov er Synden død.
  9.  Og jeg levede engang uden Lov, men da Budet kom, levede Synden
      op;
 10.  men jeg døde, og Budet, som var til Liv, det fandtes at blive
      mig til Død;
 11.  thi idet Synden fik Anledning, forførte den mig ved Budet og
      dræbte mig ved det.
 12.  Altså er Loven vel hellig, og Budet helligt og retfærdigt og
      godt.
 13.  Blev da det gode mig til Død? Det være langt fra! Men Synden
      blev det, for at den skulde vise sig som Synd, idet den ved det
      gode virkede Død for mig, for at Synden ved Budet skulde blive
      overvættes syndig.
 14.  Thi vi vide, at Loven er åndelig; men jeg er kødelig, solgt
      under Synden.
 15.  Thi jeg forstår ikke, hvad jeg udfører; thi ikke det, som jeg
      vil, øver jeg, men hvad jeg hader, det gør jeg.
 16.  Men når jeg gør det, jeg ikke vil, så samstemmer jeg med Loven
      i, at den er god.
 17.  Men nu er det ikke mere mig, som udfører det, men Synden, som
      bor i mig.
 18.  Thi jeg ved, at i mig, det vil sige i mit Kød, bor der ikke
      godt; thi Villien har jeg vel, men at udføre det gode formår jeg
      ikke;
 19.  thi det gode, som jeg vil, det gør jeg ikke; men det onde, som
      jeg ikke vil, det øver jeg.
 20.  Dersom jeg da gør det, som jeg ikke vil, så er det ikke mere
      mig, der udfører det, men Synden, som bor i mig.
 21.  Så finder jeg da den Lov for mig, som vil gøre det gode, at det
      onde ligger mig for Hånden
 22.  Thi jeg glæder mig ved Guds Lov efter det indvortes Menneske;
 23.  men jeg ser en anden Lov i mine Lemmer, som strider imod mit
      Sinds Lov og tager mig fangen under Syndens Lov, som er i mine
      Lemmer.
 24.  Jeg elendige Menneske! hvem skal fri mig fra dette Dødens
      Legeme?
 25.  Gud ske Tak ved Jesus Kristus, vor Herre! Altså: jeg selv tjener
      med Sindet Guds Lov, men med Kødet Syndens Lov.

Romerne 8

  1.  Så er der da nu ingen Fordømmelse for dem, som ere i Kristus
      Jesus.
  2.  Thi Livets Ånds Lov frigjorde mig i Kristus Jesus fra Syndens og
      Dødens Lov.
  3.  Thi det, som var Loven umuligt, det, hvori den var afmægtig ved
      Kødet, det gjorde Gud, idet han sendte sin egen Søn i syndigt
      Køds Lighed og for Syndens Skyld og således domfældte Synden i
      Kødet,
  4.  for at Lovens Krav skulde opfyldes i os, som ikke vandre efter
      Kødet, men efter Ånden.
  5.  Thi de, som lade sig lede af Kødet, hige efter det kødelige; men
      de, som lade sig lede af Ånden, hige efter det åndelige.
  6.  Thi Kødets Higen er Død, men Åndens Higen er Liv og Fred,
  7.  efterdi Kødets Higen er Fjendskab imod Gud, thi det er ikke Guds
      Lov lydigt, det kan jo ikke heller være det.
  8.  Og de, som ere i Kødet, kunne ikke tækkes Gud.
  9.  I derimod ere ikke i Kødet, men i Ånden, om ellers Guds Ånd bor
      i eder. Men om nogen ikke har Kristi Ånd, så hører han ham ikke
      til.
 10.  Men om Kristus er i eder, da er vel Legemet dødt på Grund at
      Synd, men Ånden er Liv på Grund af Retfærdighed.
 11.  Men om hans Ånd, der oprejste Jesus fra de døde, bor i eder, da
      skal han, som oprejste Kristus fra de døde, levendegøre også
      eders dødelige Legemer ved sin Ånd, som bor i eder.

 12.  Altså, Brødre! ere vi ikke Kødets Skyldnere, så at vi skulde
      leve efter Kødet;
 13.  thi dersom I leve efter Kødet, skulle I dø, men dersom l ved
      Ånden døde Legemets Gerninger, skulle I leve.
 14.  Thi så mange som drives af Guds Ånd, disse ere Guds Børn.
 15.  I modtoge jo ikke en Trældoms Ånd atter til Frygt, men I modtoge
      en Sønneudkårelses Ånd, i hvilken vi råbe: Abba, Fader!
 16.  Ånden selv vidner med vor Ånd, at vi ere Guds Børn.
 17.  Men når vi ere Børn, ere vi også Arvinger, Guds Arvinger og
      Kristi Medarvinger, om ellers vi lide med ham for også at
      herliggøres med ham.

 18.  Thi jeg holder for, at den nærværende Tids Lidelser ikke ere at
      regne imod den Herlighed, som skal åbenbares på os.
 19.  Thi Skabningens Forlængsel venter på Guds Børns Åbenbarelse.
 20.  Thi Skabningen blev underlagt Forfængeligheden, ikke med sin
      Villie, men for hans Skyld, som lagde den derunder,
 21.  med Håb om, at også Skabningen selv skal blive frigjort fra
      Forkrænkelighedens Trældom til Guds Børns Herligheds Frihed.
 22.  Thi vi vide, at hele Skabningen tilsammen sukker og er tilsammen
      i Veer indtil nu.
 23.  Dog ikke det alene, men også vi selv, som have Åndens
      Førstegrøde, også vi sukke ved os selv, idet vi forvente en
      Sønneudkårelse, vort Legemes Forløsning.
 24.  Thi i Håbet bleve vi frelste. Men et Håb, som ses, er ikke et
      Håb; thi hvad en ser, hvor kan han tillige håbe det?
 25.  Men dersom vi håbe det, som vi ikke se, da forvente vi det med
      Udholdenhed.
 26.  Og ligeledes kommer også Ånden vor Skrøbelighed til Hjælp; thi
      vi vide ikke, hvad vi skulle bede om, som det sig bør, men Ånden
      selv går i Forbøn for os med uudsigelige Sukke.
 27.  Og han, som ransager Hjerterne, ved, hvad Åndens Higen er, at
      den efter Guds Villie går i Forbøn for hellige.

 28.  Men vi vide, at alle Ting samvirke til gode for dem, som elske
      Gud, dem, som efter hans Beslutning ere kaldede.
 29.  Thi dem, han forud kendte, forudbestemte han også til at blive
      ligedannede med hans Søns Billede, for at han kunde være
      førstefødt iblandt mange Brødre.
 30.  Men dem, han forudbestemte, dem kaldte han også; og dem, han
      kaldte, dem retfærdiggjorde han også; men dem, han
      retfærdiggjorde, dem herliggjorde han også.

 31.  Hvad skulle vi da sige til dette? Er Gud for os, hvem kan da
      være imod os?
 32.  Han, som jo ikke sparede sin egen Søn, men gav ham hen for os
      alle, hvorledes skulde han ikke også med ham skænke os alle
      Ting?
 33.  Hvem vil anklage Guds udvalgte? Gud er den, som retfærdiggør.
 34.  Hvem er den, som fordømmer? Kristus er den, som er død, ja,
      meget mere, som er oprejst, som er ved Guds højre Hånd, som også
      går i Forbøn for os.
 35.  Hvem skal kunne skille os fra Kristi Kærlighed? Trængsel eller
      Angst eller Forfølgelse eller Hunger eller Nøgenhed eller Fare
      eller Sværd?
 36.  som der er skrevet: "For din Skyld dræbes vi den hele Dag, vi
      bleve regnede som Slagtefår."
 37.  Men i alt dette mere end sejre vi ved ham, som elskede os.
 38.  Thi jeg er vis på, at hverken Død eller Liv eller Engle eller
      Magter eller noget nærværende eller noget tilkommende eller
      Kræfter
 39.  eller det høje eller det dybe eller nogen anden Skabning skal
      kunne skille os fra Guds Kærlighed i Kristus Jesus, vor Herre.

Romerne 9

  1.  Sandhed siger jeg i Kristus, jeg lyver ikke, min Samvittighed
      vidner med mig i den Helligånd,
  2.  at jeg har en stor Sorg og en uafladelig Kummer i mit Hjerte.
  3.  Thi jeg kunde ønske selv at være bandlyst fra Kristus til Bedste
      for mine Brødre, mine Frænder efter Kødet,
  4.  de, som jo ere Israeliter, hvem Sønneudkårelsen og Herligheden
      og Pagterne og Lovgivningen og Gudstjenesten og Forjættelserne
      tilhøre,
  5.  hvem Fædrene tilhøre, og af hvem Kristus er efter Kødet, han,
      som er Gud over alle Ting, højlovet i Evighed! Amen.

  6.  Ikke dog som om Guds Ord har glippet; thi ikke alle, som stamme
      fra Israel, ere Israel;
  7.  ej, heller ere alle Børn, fordi de ere Abrahams Sæd, men: "I
      Isak skal en Sæd få Navn efter dig."
  8.  Det vil sige: Ikke Kødets Børn ere Guds Børn, men Forjættelsens
      Børn regnes for Sæd.
  9.  Thi et Forjættelsesord er dette: "Ved denne Tid vil jeg komme,
      så skal Sara have en Søn."
 10.  Men således skete det ikke alene dengang, men også med Rebekka,
      da hun var frugtsommelig ved een, Isak, vor Fader.
 11.  Thi da de endnu ikke vare fødte og ikke havde gjort noget godt
      eller ondt, blev der, for at Guds Udvælgelses Beslutning skulde
      stå fast, ikke i Kraft af Gerninger, men i Kraft af ham, der
      kalder,
 12.  sagt til hende: ""Den ældste skal tjene den yngste,""
 13.  som der er skrevet: ""Jakob elskede jeg, men Esau hadede jeg."

 14.  Hvad skulle vi da sige? mon der er Uretfærdighed hos Gud? Det
      være langt fra!
 15.  Thi han siger til Moses: "Jeg vil være barmhjertig imod den,
      hvem jeg er barmhjertig imod, og forbarme mig over den, hvem jeg
      forbarmer mig over."
 16.  Altså står det ikke til den, som vil, ej heller til den, som
      løber, men til Gud, som er barmhjertig.
 17.  Thi Skriften siger til Farao: "Netop derfor lod jeg dig fremstå,
      for at jeg kunde vise min Magt på dig, og for at mit Navn skulde
      forkyndes på hele Jorden."
 18.  Så forbarmer han sig da over den, som han vil, men forhærder
      den, som han vil.

 19.  Du vil nu sige til mig: Hvad klager han da over endnu? thi hvem
      står hans Villie imod?
 20.  Ja, men, hvem er dog du, o Menneske! som går i Rette med Gud?
      mon noget, som blev dannet, kan sige til den, som dannede det:
      Hvorfor gjorde du mig således?
 21.  Eller har Pottemageren ikke Rådighed over Leret til af den samme
      Masse at gøre et Kar til Ære, et andet til Vanære?
 22.  Men hvad om nu Gud, skønt han vilde vise sin Vrede og kundgøre
      sin Magt, dog med stor Langmodighed tålte Vredes-Kar, som vare
      beredte til Fortabelse,
 23.  også for at kundgøre sin Herligheds Rigdom over
      Barmhjertigheds-Kar, som han forud havde beredt til Herlighed?
 24.  Og hertil kaldte han også os, ikke alene af Jøder, men også af
      Hedninger,
 25.  som han også siger hos Hoseas: "Det, som ikke var mit Folk, vil
      jeg kalde mit Folk, og hende, som ikke var den elskede; den
      elskede;
 26.  og det skal ske, at på det Sted, hvor der blev sagt til dem: I
      ere ikke mit Folk, der skulle de kaldes den levende Guds Børn."
 27.  Men Esajas udråber over Israel: "Om end Israels Børns Tal var
      som Havets Sand, så skal kun Levningen frelses.
 28.  Thi idet Herren opgør Regnskab og afslutter det i Hast, vil han
      fuldbyrde det på Jorden."
 29.  Og som Esajas forud har sagt: "Dersom den Herre Zebaoth ikke
      havde levnet os en Sæd, da vare vi blevne som Sodoma og gjorte
      lige med Gomorra."

 30.  Hvad skulle vi da sige? At Hedninger, som ikke jagede efter
      Retfærdighed, fik Retfærdighed; nemlig Retfærdigheden af Tro;
 31.  men Israel, som jagede efter en Retfærdigheds Lov, nåede ikke
      til en sådan Lov.
 32.  Hvorfor? fordi de ikke søgte den af Tro, men som af Geringer. De
      stødte an på Anstødsstenen,
 33.  som der er skrevet: "Se, jeg sætter i Zion en Anstødssten og en
      Forargelses Klippe; og den, som tror på ham, skal ikke blive til
      Skamme."

Romerne 10

  1.  Brødre!mit Hjertes Ønske og Bøn til Gud for dem er om deres
      Frelse.
  2.  Thi jeg giver dem det Vidnesbyrd, at de have Nidkærhed for Gud,
      men ikke med Forstand;
  3.  thi da de ikke kendte Guds. Retfærdighed og tragtede efter at
      opstille deres egen Retfærdighed, så bøjede de sig ikke under
      Guds Retfærdighed.

  4.  Thi Kristus er Lovens Ende til Retfærdighed for hver den, som
      tror.
  5.  Moses skriver jo, at det Menneske, som gør den Retfærdighed, der
      er af Loven, skal leve ved den.
  6.  Men Retfærdigheden af Tro siger således: Sig ikke i dit Hjerte:
      Hvem vil fare op til Himmelen? nemlig for at hente Kristus ned;
  7.  eller: Hvem vil fare ned i Afgrunden? nemlig for at hente
      Kristus op fra de døde.
  8.  Men hvad,siger den? Ordet er dig nær, i din Mund og i dit
      Hjerte, det er det Troens Ord, som vi prædike.
  9.  Thi dersom du med din Mund bekender Jesus som Herre og tror i
      dit Hjerte, at Gud oprejste ham fra de døde, da skal du blive
      frelst.
 10.  Thi med Hjertet tror man til Retfærdighed, og med Munden
      bekender man til Frelse.
 11.  Skriften siger jo: "Hver den, som tror på ham, skal ikke blive
      til Skamme."
 12.  Thi der er ikke Forskel på Jøde og Græker; thi den samme er
      alles Herre, rig nok for alle dem, som påkalde ham.
 13.  Thi hver den, som påkalder Herrens Navn, skal blive frelst.

 14.  Hvorledes skulde de nu påkalde den, på hvem de ikke have troet?
      og hvorledes skulde de tro den, som de ikke have hørt? og
      hvorledes skulde de høre, uden der er nogen, som prædiker?
 15.  og hvorledes skulde de prædike, dersom de ikke bleve udsendte?
      Som der er skrevet: "Hvor dejlige. ere deres Fødder, som
      forkynde godt Budskab."
 16.  Dog ikke alle løde Evangeliet; thi Esajas siger: "Herre! hvem
      troede det, (han hørte af os?")
 17.  Altså kommer Troen af det. som høres, men det, som høres, kommer
      igennem Kristi Ord.
 18.  Men jeg siger: Have de ikke hørt? Jo vist, "over hele Jorden er
      deres Røst udgået og til Jorderiges Grænser deres Ord."
 19.  Men jeg siger: Har Israel ikke forstået det? Først siger Moses:
      "Jeg vil gøre eder nidkære på et Folk, som ikke er et Folk, imod
      et uforstandigt Folk vil jeg opirre eder."
 20.  Men Esajas drister sig til at sige: "Jeg blev funden af dem, som
      ikke søgte mig; jeg blev åbenbar for dem. som ikke spurgte efter
      mig."
 21.  Men om Israel siger han: "Den hele Dag udstrakte jeg mine Hænder
      imod et ulydigt og genstridigt Folk."

Romerne 11

  1.  Jeg siger da: Mon Gud har forskudt sit folk? det være langt fra!
      Thi også jeg er en Israelit, af "Abrahams Sæd, Benjamins Stamme.
  2.  Gud har ikke forskudt sit Folk, som han forud kendte. Eller vide
      I ikke, hvad Skriften siger i Stykket om Elias? hvorledes han
      træder frem for Gud imod Israel, sigende:
  3.  "Herre! dine Profeter have de ihjelslået, dine Altre have de
      nedbrudt, og jeg er den eneste, der er levnet, og de efterstræbe
      mit Liv."
  4.  Men hvad siger det guddommelige Gensvar til ham?"Jeg har levnet
      mig selv syv Tusinde Mænd, som ikke have bøjet Knæ for Bål."
  5.  Således er der også i den nærværende Tid blevet en Levning som
      et Nådes-Udvalg.
  6.  Men er det af Nåde, da er det ikke mere af Gerninger, ellers
      bliver Nåden ikke mere Nåde.
  7.  Hvad altså? Det, Israel søger efter, har det ikke opnået, men
      Udvalget har opnået det; de øvrige derimod bleve forhærdede,
  8.  som der er skrevet: "Gud gav dem en Sløvheds Ånd, Øjne til ikke
      at se med, Øren til ikke at høre med indtil den Dag i Dag."
  9.  Og David siger: "Deres Bord vorde til Snare og til Fælde og til
      Anstød og til Gengældelse for dem;
 10.  deres Øjne vorde formørkede, så de ikke se, og bøj altid deres
      Ryg!"

 11.  Jeg siger da: Mon de have stødt an, for at de skulde falde? Det
      være langt fra! Men ved deres Fald er Frelsen kommen til
      Hedningerne, for at dette kunde vække dem til Nidkærhed.
 12.  Men dersom deres Fald er Verdens Rigdom, og deres Tab er
      Hedningers Rigdom, hvor meget mere skal deres Fylde være det!
 13.  Og til eder, I Hedninger, siger jeg: For så vidt jeg nu er
      Hedningeapostel, ærer jeg min Tjeneste,
 14.  om jeg dog kunde vække min Slægt til Nidkærhed og frelse nogle
      af dem.
 15.  Thi dersom deres Forkastelse er Verdens Forligelse, hvad bliver
      da deres Antagelse andet end Liv ud af døde?

 16.  Men dersom Førstegrøden er hellig, da er Dejgen det også; og
      dersom Roden er hellig, da ere Grenene det også.
 17.  Men om nogle af Grenene bleve afbrudte, og du, en vild
      Oliekvist, blev indpodet iblandt dem og blev meddelagtig i
      Olietræets Rod og Fedme,
 18.  da ros dig ikke imod Grenene; men dersom du roser dig, da bærer
      jo ikke du Roden, men Roden dig.
 19.  Du vil vel sige: Grene bleve afbrudte, for at jeg skulde blive
      indpodet.
 20.  Vel! ved deres Vantro bleve de afbrudte, men du står ved din
      Tro; vær ikke overmodig, men frygt!
 21.  Thi når Gud ikke sparede de naturlige Grene, vil han heller ikke
      spare dig.
 22.  Så se da Guds Godhed og Strenghed: Over dem, som faldt, er der
      Strenghed, men over dig Guds Godhed, hvis du bliver i hans
      Godhed; ellers skal også du afhugges.
 23.  Men også hine skulle indpodes, dersom de ikke blive i Vantroen;
      thi Gud er mægtig til atter at indpode dem.
 24.  Thi når du blev afhugget af det Olietræ, som er vildt af
      Naturen, og imod Naturen blev indpodet i et ædelt Olietræ, hvor
      meget mere skulle da disse indpodes i deres eget Olietræ, som de
      af Natur tilhøre!

 25.  Thi jeg vil ikke, Brødre! at I skulle være uvidende om denne
      Hemmelighed, for at I ikke skulle være kloge i eders egne
      Tanker, at Forhærdelse delvis er kommen over Israel, indtil
      Hedningernes Fylde er gået ind;
 26.  og så skal hele Israel frelses, som der er skrevet: "Fra Zion
      skal Befrieren komme, han skal afvende Ugudeligheder fra Jakob;
 27.  og dette er min Pagt med dem, når jeg borttager deres Synder."
 28.  Efter Evangeliet er de vel Fjender for eders Skyld, men efter
      Udvælgelsen ere de elskede for Fædrenes Skyld;
 29.  thi Nådegaverne og sit Kald fortryder Gud ikke.
 30.  Thi ligesom I tilforn bleve ulydige imod Gud, men nu fik
      Barmhjertighed ved disses Ulydighed,
 31.  således bleve også disse nu ulydige, for at også de måtte få
      Barmhjertighed ved den Barmhjertighed, som er bleven eder til
      Del.
 32.  Thi Gud har indesluttet alle under Ulydighed, for at han kunde
      forbarme sig over alle.
 33.  O Dyb af Guds Rigdom og Visdom og Kundskab! hvor uransagelige
      ere hans Domme, og hans Veje usporlige!
 34.  Thi hvem har kendt Herrens Sind? eller hvem blev hans Rådgiver?
 35.  eller hvem gav ham først, så at der skulde gives ham Gengæld
      derfor?
 36.  Thi af ham og ved ham og til ham ere alle Ting; ham være Ære i
      Evighed! Amen.

Romerne 12

  1.  Jeg formaner eder altså, Brødre! ved Guds Barmhjertighed, til at
      fremstille eder Legemer som et levende, helligt, Gud
      velbehageligt Offer; dette er eders fornuftige Gudsdyrkelse.
  2.  Og skikker eder ikke lige med denne Verden, men vorder
      forvandlede ved Sindets Fornyelse, så I må skønne, hvad der er
      Guds Villie, det gode og velbehagelige og fuldkomne.

  3.  Thi ved den Nåde, som er given mig, siger jeg til enhver iblandt
      eder, at han ikke skal tænke højere om sig selv, end han bør
      tænke, men tænke med Betænksomhed, efter som Gud tildelte enhver
      Troens Mål.
  4.  Thi ligesom vi have mange Lemmer på eet Legeme, men Lemmerne
      ikke alle have den samme Gerning,
  5.  således ere vi mange eet Legeme i Kristus, men hver for sig
      hverandres Lemmer.
  6.  Men efterdi vi have forskellige Nådegaver efter den Nåde, som er
      given os, det være sig Profeti, da lader os bruge den i Forhold
      til vor Tro;
  7.  eller en Tjeneste, da lader os tage Vare på Tjenesten; eller om
      nogen lærer, på Lærergerningen;
  8.  eller om nogen formaner, på Formaningen; den, som uddeler, gøre
      det med Redelighed; den, som er Forstander, være det med Iver;
      den, som øver Barmhjertighed, gøre det med Glæde!

  9.  Kærligheden være uskrømtet; afskyer det onde, holder eder til
      det gode;
 10.  værer i eders Broderkærlighed hverandre inderligt hengivne;
      forekommer hverandre i at vise Ærbødighed!
 11.  Værer ikke lunkne i eders Iver; værer brændende i Ånden; tjener
      Herren;
 12.  værer glade i Håbet, udholdende i Trængselen, vedholdende i
      Bønnen!
 13.  Tager Del i de helliges Fornødenheder; lægger Vind på
      Gæstfrihed!
 14.  Velsigner dem, som forfølge eder, velsigner og forbander ikke!
 15.  Glæder eder med de glade, og græder med de grædende!
 16.  Værer enige indbyrdes; tragter ikke efter de høje Ting, men
      holder eder til det lave; vorder ikke kloge i eders egne Tanker!
 17.  Betaler ikke nogen ondt for ondt; lægger Vind på, hvad der er
      godt for alle Menneskers Åsyn!
 18.  Dersom det er muligt - såvidt det står til eder - da holder Fred
      med alle Mennesker:
 19.  Hævner eder ikke selv, I elskede! men giver Vreden Rum; thi der
      er skrevet: "Mig hører Hævnen til, jeg vil betale, siger
      Herren."
 20.  Nej, dersom din Fjende hungrer, giv ham Mad; dersom han tørster,
      giv ham Drikke; thi når du gør dette, vil du samle gloende Kul
      på hans Hoved.
 21.  Lad dig ikke overvinde af det onde, men overvind det onde med
      det gode!

Romerne 13

  1.  Hver Sjæl underordne sig de foresatte Øvrigheder; thi der er
      ikke Øvrighed uden af Gud, men de, som ere, ere indsatte af Gud,
  2.  så at den, som sætter sig imod Øvrigheden, modstår Guds Ordning;
      men de, som modstå, skulle få deres Dom.
  3.  Thi de styrende ere ikke en Skræk for den gode Gerning, men for
      den onde. Men vil du være uden Frygt for Øvrigheden, så gør det
      gode, og du skal få Ros af den.
  4.  Thi den er en Guds Tjener, dig til gode. Men dersom du gør det
      onde, da frygt; thi den bærer ikke Sværdet forgæves; den er
      nemlig Guds Tjener, en Hævner til Straf for den, som øver det
      onde.
  5.  Derfor er det nødvendigt at underordne sig, ikke alene for
      Straffens Skyld, men også for Samvittighedens.
  6.  Derfor betale I jo også Skatter; thi de ere Guds Tjenere, som
      just tage Vare på dette.
  7.  Betaler alle, hvad I ere dem skyldige: den, som I ere Skat
      skyldige, Skat; den, som Told, Told; den, som Frygt, Frygt; den,
      som Ære, Ære.

  8.  Bliver ingen noget skyldige, uden det, at elske hverandre; thi
      den, som elsker den anden, har opfyldt Loven.
  9.  Thi det: "Du må ikke bedrive Hor; du må ikke slå ihjel; du må
      ikke stjæle; du må ikke begære," og hvilket andet bud der er,
      det sammenfattes i dette Ord: "Du skal elske din Næste som dig
      selv,"
 10.  Kærligheden gør ikke ondt imod Næsten; derfor er Kærligheden
      Lovens Fylde.

 11.  Og dette just, fordi I kende Tiden, at det alt er på Tide, at I
      skulle stå op af Søvne; thi nu er vor Frelse nærmere, end da vi
      bleve troende.
 12.  Natten er fremrykket, og Dagen er kommen nær. Lader os derfor
      aflægge Mørkets Gerninger og iføre os Lysets Våben;
 13.  lader os vandre sømmeligt som om Dagen, ikke i Svir og Drik,
      ikke i Løsagtighed og Uterlighed, ikke i Kiv og Avind;
 14.  men ifører eder den Herre Jesus Kristus, og drager ikke Omsorg
      for Kødet, så Begæringer vækkes!

Romerne 14

  1.  Men tager eder af den, som er skrøbelig i Troen, og dømmer ikke
      hans Meninger!
  2.  En har Tro til at spise alt; men den skrøbelige spiser kun
      Urter.
  3.  Den, som spiser, må ikke ringeagte den, som ikke spiser; og den,
      som ikke spiser, må ikke dømme den, som spiser; thi Gud har
      taget sig af ham.
  4.  Hvem er du, som dømmer en andens Tjener? For sin egen Herre står
      eller falder han; men han skal blive stående, thi Herren er
      mægtig til at lade ham stå.
  5.  En agter den ene Dag fremfor den anden, en anden agter alle dage
      lige; enhver have fuld Vished i sit eget Sind!
  6.  Den, som lægger Vægt på Dagen, han gør det for Herren. Og den,
      som spiser, gør det for Herren, thi han takker Gud; og den, som
      ikke spiser, gør det for Herren og takker Gud.
  7.  Thi ingen af os lever for sig selv, og ingen dør for sig selv;
  8.  thi når vi leve, leve vi for Herren, og når vi dø, dø vi for
      Herren; derfor, enten vi leve, eller vi dø, ere vi Herrens.
  9.  Dertil er jo Kristus død og bleven levende, at han skal herske
      både over døde og levende.
 10.  Men du, hvorfor dømmer du din Broder? eller du, hvorfor
      ringeagter du din Broder? Vi skulle jo alle fremstilles for Guds
      Domstol.
 11.  Thi der er skrevet: "Så sandt jeg lever, siger Herren, for mig
      skal hvert Knæ bøje sig, og hver Tunge skal bekende Gud."
 12.  Altså skal hver af os gøre Gud Regnskab for sig selv.

 13.  Derfor,lader os ikke mere dømme hverandre, men dømmer hellere
      dette, at man ikke må give sin Broder Anstød eller Forargelse.
 14.  Jeg ved og er vis på i den Herre Jesus, at intet er urent i sig
      selv; dog, for den, som agter noget for urent, for ham er det
      urent.
 15.  Thi dersom din Broder bedrøves for Mads Skyld, da vandrer du
      ikke mere i Kærlighed. Led ikke ved din Mad den i Fordærvelse,
      for hvis Skyld Kristus er død.
 16.  Lader derfor ikke eders Gode blive bespottet!
 17.  Thi Guds Rige består ikke i at spise og drikke, men i
      Retfærdighed og Fred og Glæde i den Helligånd.
 18.  Thi den, som deri tjener Kristus, er velbehagelig for Gud og
      tækkelig for Menneskene.
 19.  Derfor, lader os tragte efter det, som tjener til Fred og
      indbyrdes Opbyggelse!
 20.  Nedbryd ikke Guds Værk for Mads Skyld! Vel er alt rent, men det
      er ondt for det Menneske, som spiser med Anstød.
 21.  Det er rigtigt ikke at spise Kød eller at drikke Vin eller at
      gøre noget, hvoraf din Broder tager Anstød.
 22.  Den Tro, du har, hav den hos dig selv for Gud! Salig er den, som
      ikke dømmer sig selv i det, som han vælger.
 23.  Men den, som tvivler, når han spiser, han er domfældt, fordi det
      ikke er at Tro; men alt det, som ikke er af Tro, er Synd.

Romerne 15

  1.  Men vi, som ere stærke, bør bære de svages Skrøbeligheder og
      ikke være os selv til Behag.
  2.  Enhver af os være sin Næste til Behag til det gode, til
      Opbyggelse.
  3.  Thi også Kristus var ikke sig selv til Behag; men, som der er
      skrevet: "Deres Forhånelser, som håne dig, ere faldne på mig."
  4.  Thi alt, hvad der er skrevet tilforn, det er skrevet til vor
      Belæring, for at vi skulle have Håbet ved Udholdenheden og
      Skrifternes Trøst.
  5.  Men Udholdenhedensog Trøstens Gud give eder at være enige
      indbyrdes, som Kristus Jesus vil det,
  6.  for at I endrægtigt med een Mund kunne prise Gud og vor Herres
      Jesu Kristi Fader.
  7.  Derfor tager eder af hverandre, ligesom også Kristus har taget
      sig af os, til Guds Ære.
  8.  Jeg siger nemlig, at Kristus er bleven Tjener for omskårne for
      Guds Sanddruheds Skyld for at stadfæste Forjættelserne til
      Fædrene;
  9.  men at Hedningerne skulle prise Gud for hans Barmhjertigheds
      Skyld, som der er skrevet: "Derfor vil jeg bekende dig iblandt
      Hedninger og lovsynge dit Navn,"
 10.  Og atter siges der: "Fryder eder, I Hedninger, med hans Folk!"
 11.  Og atter: "Lover Herren, alle Hedninger, og alle Folkene skulle
      prise ham."
 12.  Og atter siger Esajas: "Komme skal Isajs Rodskud og han, der
      rejser sig for at herske over Hedninger; på ham skulle Hedninger
      håbe."
 13.  Men Håbets Gud fylde eder med al Glæde og Fred, idet I tro, for
      at I må blive rige i Håbet ved den Helligånds Kraft!

 14.  Men også jeg, mine Brødre! har selv den Forvisning om eder, at I
      også selv ere fulde af Godhed, fyldte med al Kundskab, i Stand
      til også at påminde hverandre.
 15.  Dog har jeg for en Del tilskrevet eder noget dristigere for at
      påminde eder på Grund af den Nåde, som er given mig fra Gud
 16.  til iblandt Hedningerne at være en Kristi Jesu Offertjener, der
      som Præst betjener Guds Evangelium, for at Hedningerne må blive
      et velbehageligt Offer, helliget ved den Helligånd.
 17.  Således har jeg min Ros i Kristus Jesus af min Tjeneste for Gud.
 18.  Thi jeg vil ikke driste mig til at tale om noget af det, som
      Kristus ikke har udført ved mig til at virke Hedningers
      Lydighed, ved Ord og Handling,
 19.  ved Tegns og Undergerningers Kraft, ved Guds Ånds Kraft, så at
      jeg fra Jerusalem og trindt omkring indtil Illyrien har til
      fulde forkyndt Kristi Evangelium;
 20.  dog således, at jeg sætter min Ære i at forkynde Evangeliet ikke
      der, hvor Kristus er nævnet, for at jeg,ikke skal bygge på en
      andens Grundvold,
 21.  men, som der er skrevet: "De, for hvem der ikke blev kundgjort
      om ham, skulle se, og de, som ikke have hørt, skulle forstå."

 22.  Derfor er jeg også de mange Gange bleven forhindret i at komme
      til eder.
 23.  Men nu, da jeg ikke mere har Rum i disse Egne og i mange År har
      haft Længsel efter at komme til eder,
 24.  vil jeg, når jeg rejser til Spanien, komme til eder; thi jeg
      håber at se eder på Gennemrejsen og af eder at blive befordret
      derhen, når jeg først i nogen Måde er bleven tilfredsstillet hos
      eder.
 25.  Men nu rejser jeg til Jerusalem i Tjeneste for de hellige.
 26.  Thi Makedonien og Akaja have fundet Glæde i at gøre et
      Sammenskud til de fattige iblandt de hellige i Jerusalem.
 27.  De have nemlig fundet Glæde deri, og de ere deres Skyldnere. Thi
      ere Hedningerne blevne delagtige i hines åndelige Goder, da ere
      de også skyldige at tjene dem med de timelige.
 28.  Når jeg da har fuldbragt dette og beseglet denne Frugt for dem,
      vil jeg derfra drage om ad eder til Spanien.
 29.  Men jeg ved, at når jeg kommer til eder, skal jeg komme med
      Kristi Velsignelses Fylde.

 30.  Men jeg formaner eder,Brødre! ved vor Herre Jesus Kristus og ved
      Åndens Kærlighed til med mig at stride i eders Bønner for mig
      til Gud,
 31.  for at jeg må udfries fra de genstridige i Judæa, og mit Ærinde
      til Jerusalem må blive de hellige kærkomment,
 32.  for at jeg kan komme til eder med Glæde, ved Guds Villie, og
      vederkvæges med eder.
 33.  Men Fredens Gud være med eder alle! Amen.

Romerne 16

  1.  Men jeg anbefaler eder Føbe, vor Søster, som er Tjenerinde ved
      Menighed i Kenkreæ,
  2.  for at I må modtage hende i Herren, som det sømmer sig de
      hellige, og yde hende Bistand, i hvad som helst hun måtte trænge
      til eder; thi også hun har været en Hjælperske for mange og for
      mig selv med.
  3.  Hilser Priska og Akvila, mine Medarbejdere i Kristus Jesus,
  4.  som jo for mit Liv have sat deres egen Hals i Vove, hvem ikke
      alene jeg takker, men også alle Hedningernes Menigheder;
  5.  og hilser Menigheden i deres Hus! Hilser Epænetus, min elskede,
      som er Asiens Førstegrøde for Kristus.
  6.  Hilser Maria, som har arbejdet meget for eder.
  7.  Hilser Andronikus og Junias, mine Frænder og mine medfangne, som
      jo ere navnkundige iblandt Apostlene og tilmed have været i
      Kristus før mig.
  8.  Hilser Ampliatus, min elskede i Herren!
  9.  Hilser Urbanus, vor Medarbejder i Kristus, og Stakys, min
      elskede!
 10.  Hilser Apelles, den prøvede i Kristus. Hilser dem, som ere af
      Aristobulus's Hus.
 11.  Hilser Herodion, min Frænde! Hilser dem af Narkissus's Hus, som
      ere i Herren.
 12.  Hilser Tryfæna og Tryfosa, som arbejde i Herren. Hilser; Persis,
      den elskede, som jo har arbejdet meget i Herren.
 13.  Hilser Rufus, den udvalgte i Herren, og hans og min Moder!
 14.  Hilser Asynkritus,Flegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas og Brødrene
      hos dem!
 15.  Hilser Filologus og Julia, Nereus og hans Søster og Olympas og
      alle de hellige hos dem!
 16.  Hilser hverandre med et helligt Kys! Alle Kristi Menigheder
      hilse eder!

 17.  Men jeg formaner eder, Brødre! til at give Agt på dem, som volde
      Splittelseme og Forargelseme tvært imod den Lære, som I have
      lært, og viger bort fra dem!
 18.  Thi sådanne tjene ikke vor Herre Kristus, men deres egen Bug, og
      ved søde Ord og skøn Tale forføre de troskyldiges Hjerter.
 19.  Eders Lydighed er jo kommen alle for Øre; derfor glæder jeg mig
      over eder. Men jeg vil, at I skulle være vise med Hensyn til det
      gode og enfoldige med Hensyn til det onde.
 20.  Men Fredens Gud skal hastelig knuse Satan under eders
      Fødder. Vore Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde være med eder!

 21.  Timotheus, min Medarbejder, og Lukius og Jason og Sosipater,
      mine Frænder, hilse eder.
 22.  Jeg,Tertius, som har nedskrevet dette Brev, hilser eder i
      Herren.
 23.  Kajus, min og den hele Menigheds Vært, hilser eder. Erastus,
      Stadens Rentemester, hilser eder, og Broderen Kvartus.

 24.  Vor Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde være med eder alle! Amen.)
 25.  Men ham, som kan styrke eder i mit Evangelium og Forkyndelsen af
      Jesus Kristus, i Overensstemmelse med Åbenbarelse af en
      Hemmelighed, som var fortiet fra evige Tider,
 26.  men nu er bragt for Dagen og ved profetiske Skrifter efter den
      evige Guds Befaling kundgjort for alle Hedningerne til
      TrosLydighed:
 27.  Den ene vise Gud ved Jesus Kristus, ham være Ære i Evigheders
      Evighed! Amen.


1.Korinterne

1.Korinterne 1

  1.  Paulus, Jesu Kristi kaldede Apostel ved Guds Villie, og Broderen
      Sosthenes
  2.  til Guds Menighed, som er i Korinth, helligede i Kristus Jesus,
      hellige ifølge Kald tillige med alle dem, der på ethvert Sted
      påkalde vor Herres Jesu Kristi, deres og vor Herres Navn:
  3.  Nåde være med eder og Fred fra Gud vor Fader og den Herre Jesus
      Kristus!

  4.  Jeg takker min Gud altid for eder, for den Guds Nåde, som blev
      givet eder i Kristus Jesus,
  5.  at I ved ham ere blevne rige i alt, i al Tale og al Kundskab,
  6.  ligesom Vidnesbyrdet om Kristus er blevet stadfæstet hos eder,
  7.  så at I ikke stå tilbage i nogen Nådegave, idet I forvente vor
      Herres Jesu Kristi Åbenbarelse,
  8.  han, som også skal stadfæste eder indtil Enden som ustraffelige
      på vor Herres Jesu Kristi Dag,
  9.  Trofast er Gud, ved hvem I bleve kaldede til Samfund med hans
      Søn, Jesus Kristus, vor Herre.

 10.  Men jeg formaner eder, Brødre! ved vor Herres Jesu Kristi Navn,
      at I alle skulle føre samme Tale, og at der ikke må findes
      Splittelser iblandt eder, men at I skulle være forenede i det
      samme Sind og i den samme Mening.
 11.  Thi det er blevet mig fortalt om eder, mine Brødre! af Bloes
      Husfolk, at der er Splidagtighed iblandt eder.
 12.  Jeg mener dette, at enhver af eder siger: Jeg hører Paulus til,
      og jeg Apollos, og jeg Kefas, og jeg Kristus.
 13.  Er Kristus delt? mon Paulus blev korsfæstet for eder? eller
      bleve I døbte til Paulus's Navn?
 14.  Jeg takker Gud for, at jeg ikke døbte nogen af eder, uden
      Krispus og Kajus,
 15.  for at ikke nogen skal sige, at I bleve døbte til mit Navn.
 16.  Dog, jeg døbte også Stefanas's Hus; ellers ved jeg ikke, om jeg
      døbte nogen anden.

 17.  Thi Kristus sendte mig ikke for at døbe, men for at forkynde
      Evangeliet, ikke med vise Ord, for at Kristi Kors ikke skulde
      tabe sin Kraft.
 18.  Thi Korsets Ord er vel for dem, som fortabes, en Dårskab, men
      for dem, som frelses, for os er det en Guds Kraft.
 19.  Thi der er skrevet: "Jeg vil lægge de vises Visdom øde, og de
      forstandiges Forstand vil jeg gøre til intet."
 20.  Hvor er der en viis? hvor er der en skriftklog? hvor er der en
      Ordkæmper al denne verden? har Gud ikke gjort Verdens Visdom til
      Dårskab?
 21.  Thi efterdi Verden ved sin Visdom ikke erkendte Gud i hans
      Visdom, behagede det Gud ved Prædikenens Dårskab at frelse dem,
      som tro,
 22.  eftersom både Jøder kræve Tegn, og Grækere søge Visdom,
 23.  vi derimod prædike Kristus som korsfæstet, for Jøder en
      Forargelse og for Hedninger en Dårskab,
 24.  men for selve de kaldede både Jøder og Grækere, Kristus som Guds
      Kraft og Guds Visdom.
 25.  Thi Guds Dårskab er visere end Menneskene, og Guds Svaghed er
      stærkere end Menneskene.

 26.  Thi ser, Brødre! på eders Kaldelse, at I ere ikke mange vise
      efter Kødet, ikke mange mægtige, ikke mange fornemme;
 27.  men det, som var Dårskab for Verden udvalgte Gud for at beskæmme
      de vise, og det, som var svagt for Verden, udvalgte Gud for at
      beskæmme det stærke;
 28.  og det for Verden uædle og det ringeagtede, det, som intet var,
      udvalgte Gud for at gøre det, som var noget, til intet,
 29.  for at intet Kød skal rose sig for Gud.
 30.  Men ud af ham ere I i Kristus Jesus, som blev os Visdom fra Gud,
      både Retfærdighed og Helliggørelse og Forløsning;
 31.  for at, som der er skrevet: "Den, som roser sig, rose sig af
      Herren!"

1.Korinterne 2

  1.  Og jeg, Brødre! da jeg kom til eder, kom jeg ikke og forkyndte
      eder Gud Vidnesbyrd med Stormægtighed i Tale eller i Visdom;
  2.  thi jeg agtede ikke at vide noget iblandt eder uden Jesus
      Kristus og ham korsfæstet;
  3.  og jeg færdedes hos eder i Svaghed og i Frygt og megen Bæven,
  4.  og min Tale og min Prædiken var ikke med Visdoms overtalende
      Ord, men med Ånds og Krafts Bevisning,
  5.  for at eders Tro ikke skulde bero på Menneskers Visdom, men på
      Guds Kraft.

  6.  Dog, Visdom tale vi iblandt de fuldkomne, men en Visdom, der
      ikke stammer fra denne Verden, ikke heller fra denne Verdens
      Herskere, som blive til intet;
  7.  men vi tale Visdom fra Gud, den hemmelige, den, som var skjult,
      som Gud før Verdens Begyndelse forudbestemte til vor Herlighed,
  8.  hvilken ingen af denne Verdens Herskere har erkendt; thi; havde
      de erkendt den,havde de ikke korsfæstet Herlighedens Herre;
  9.  men, som der er skrevet: "Hvad intet Øje har set, og intet Øre
      har hørt, og ikke er opkommet i noget Menneskes Hjerte, hvad Gud
      har beredt dem, som elske ham."
 10.  Men os åbenbarede Gud det ved Ånden; thi Ånden ransager alle
      Ting, også Guds Dybder.
 11.  Thi hvilket Menneske ved, hvad der er i Mennesket, uden
      Menneskets Ånd, som er i ham? Således har heller ingen erkendt,
      hvad der er i Gud, uden Guds Ånd.
 12.  Men vi have ikke fået Verdens Ånd, men Ånden fra Gud, for at vi
      kunne vide, hvad der er os skænket af Gud;
 13.  og dette tale vi også, ikke med Ord, lærte af menneskelig
      Visdom, men med Ord, lærte af Ånden, idet vi tolke åndelige Ting
      med åndelige Ord.

 14.  Men det sjælelige Menneske tager ikke imod de Ting, som høre
      Guds Ånd til; thi de ere ham en Dårskab, og han kan ikke erkende
      dem, thi de bedømmes åndeligt.
 15.  Men den åndelige bedømmer alle Ting, selv derimod bedømmes han
      af ingen.
 16.  Thi hvem har kendt Herrens Sind, så han skulde kunne undervise
      ham? Men vi have Kristi Sind.

1.Korinterne 3

  1.  Og jeg, Brødre! kunde ikke tale til eder som til åndelige, men
      som til kødelige, som til spæde Børn i Kristus.
  2.  Mælk gav jeg eder at drikke, ikke fast Føde; thi I kunde endnu
      ikke tåle det, ja, I kunne det ikke engang nu;
  3.  thi endnu ere I kødelige. Når der nemlig er Nid og Splid iblandt
      eder, ere I da ikke kødelige og vandre på Menneskers Vis?
  4.  Thi når en siger: "Jeg hører Paulus til," og en anden: "Jeg
      hører Apollos til," ere I så ikke "Mennesker"?

  5.  Hvad er da Apollos? og hvad er Paulus? Tjenere, ved hvilke I
      bleve troende og det, efter som Herren gav enhver.
  6.  Jeg plantede, Apollos vandede, men Gud gav Vækst.
  7.  Så er da hverken den noget, som planter, ikke heller den, som
      vander, men Gud, som giver Vækst.
  8.  Den, som planter, og den, som vander, ere eet; men hver skal få
      sin egen Løn efter sit eget Arbejde.
  9.  Thi Guds Medarbejdere ere vi; Guds Ager, Guds Bygning ere I.

 10.  Efter den Guds Nåde, som blev given mig, har jeg som en viis
      Bygmester lagt Grundvold, men en anden bygger derpå. Men enhver
      se til, hvorledes han bygger derpå!
 11.  thi anden Grundvold kan ingen lægge end den, som er lagt,
      hvilken er Jesus Kristus.
 12.  Men dersom nogen på Grundvolden bygger med Guld, Sølv, kostbare
      Sten, Træ, Hø, Strå,
 13.  da skal enhvers Arbejde blive åbenbaret; thi Dagen skal gøre det
      klart, efterdi den åbenbares med Ild, og hvordan enhvers Arbejde
      er, det skal Ilden prøve.
 14.  Dersom det Arbejde, som en har bygget derpå, består, da skal han
      få Løn;
 15.  dersom ens Arbejde bliver opbrændt, da skal han gå Glip af den;
      men selv skal han blive frelst, dog som igennem Ild.
 16.  Vide I ikke, at I ere Guds Tempel, og Guds Ånd bor i eder?
 17.  Dersom nogen fordærver Guds Tempel, skal Gud fordærve ham; thi
      Guds Tempel er helligt, og det ere jo I.

 18.  Ingen bedrage sig selv! Dersom nogen tykkes at være viis iblandt
      eder i denne Verden, han vorde en Dåre, for at han kan vorde
      viis.
 19.  Thi denne Verdens Visdom er Dårskab for Gud; thi der er skrevet:
      "Han er den, som griber de vise i deres Træskhed;"
 20.  og atter:"Herren kender de vises Tanker, at de ere
      forfængelige."
 21.  Derfor rose ingen sig af Mennesker! Alle Ting ere jo eders,
 22.  være sig Paulus eller Apollos eller Kefas eller Verden eller Liv
      eller Død eller det nærværende eller det tilkommende: alle Ting
      ere eders;
 23.  men I ere Kristi, og Kristus er Guds.

1.Korinterne 4

  1.  Således agte man os; som Kristi Tjenere og Husholdere over Guds
      Hemmeligheder!
  2.  I øvrigt kræves her af Husholdere, at man må findes tro,
  3.  Men mig er det såre lidet at bedømmes af eder eller af en
      menneskelig Ret; ja, jeg bedømmer end ikke mig selv.
  4.  Thi vel ved jeg intet med mig selv, dog er jeg ikke dermed
      retfærdiggjort; men den, som bedømmer mig, er Herren.
  5.  Derfor dømmer ikke noget før Tiden, førend Herren kommer, som
      både skal bringe for lyset det, som er skjult i Mørket, og
      åbenbare Hjerternes Råd; og da skal enhver få sin Ros fra Gud.

  6.  Men dette, Brødre! har jeg anvendt på mig selv og Apollos for
      eders Skyld, for at I på os kunne lære dette "ikke ud over, hvad
      der står skrevet", for at ikke nogen af eder for eens Skyld skal
      opblæse sig mod en anden.
  7.  Thi hvem giver dig Fortrin? og hvad har du, som du ikke har fået
      givet? men når du virkelig har fået det, hvorfor roser du dig
      da, som om du ikke havde fået det?
  8.  I ere allerede mættede, I ere allerede blevne rige, I ere blevne
      Konger uden os, ja, gid I dog vare blevne Konger, for at også vi
      kunde være Konger med eder!
  9.  Thi mig synes, at Gud har fremstillet os Apostle som de
      ringeste, ligesom dødsdømte; thi et Skuespilere vi blevne for
      Verden, både for Engle og Mennesker.
 10.  Vi ere Dårer for Kristi Skyld, men I ere kloge i Kristus; vi
      svage, men I stærke; I hædrede, men vi vanærede.
 11.  Indtil denne Time lide vi både Hunger og Tørst og Nøgenhed og få
      Næveslag og have intet blivende Sted
 12.  og arbejde møjsommeligt med vore egne Hænder. Udskælder man os,
      velsigne vi; forfølger man os, finde vi os deri;
 13.  spotter man os, give vi gode Ord; som Verdens Fejeskarn ere vi
      blevne, et Udskud for alle indtil nu.

 14.  Ikke for at beskæmme eder skriver jeg dette; men jeg påminder
      eder som mine elskede Børn.
 15.  Thi om I end have ti Tusinde Opdragere i Kristus, have I dog
      ikke mange Fædre; thi jeg har i Kristus Jesus avlet eder ved
      Evangeliet.
 16.  Jeg formaner eder altså, vorder mine Efterfølgere!
 17.  Derfor har jeg sendt Timotheus til eder, som er mit elskede og
      trofaste Barn i Herren, og han skal minde eder om mine Veje i
      Kristus, således som jeg lærer alle Vegne i enhver Menighed.
 18.  Men nogle ere blevne opblæste, i den Tanke, at jeg ikke kommer
      til eder;
 19.  men jeg skal snart komme til eder, om Herren vil, og gøre mig
      bekendt, ikke med de opblæstes Ord, men med deres Kraft.
 20.  Thi Guds Rige består ikke i Ord, men i Kraft.
 21.  Hvad ville I? Skal jeg komme til eder med Ris eller med
      Kærlighed og Sagtmodigheds Ånd?

1.Korinterne 5

  1.  I det hele taget høres der om Utugt iblandt eder, og det sådan
      Utugt, som end ikke findes iblandt Hedningerne, at en lever med
      sin Faders Hustru.
  2.  Og I ere opblæste og bleve ikke snarere bedrøvede, for at den,
      som har gjort denne Gerning, måtte udstødes af eders Midte!
  3.  Thi jeg for min Del, fraværende med Legemet, men nærværende med
      Ånden, har allerede, som om jeg var nærværende, fældet den Dom
      over ham, som på sådan, Vis har bedrevet dette,
  4.  at, når i vor Herres Jesu Navn I og min Ånd ere forsamlede, så
      med vor Herres Jesu Kraft
  5.  at overgive den pågældende til Satan til Kødets Undergang, for
      af Ånden kan frelses på den Herres Jesu dag.
  6.  Det er ikke noget smukt, I rose eder af! Vide I ikke, at en
      liden Surdejg syrer hele Dejgen?
  7.  Udrenser den gamle Surdejg, for at I kunne være en ny Dejg,
      ligesom I jo ere usyrede;thi også vort Påskelam er slagtet,
      nemlig Kristus.
  8.  Derfor, lader os holde Højtid, ikke med gammel Surdejg, ej
      heller med Sletheds og Ondskabs Surdejg, men med Renheds og
      Sandheds usyrede Brød.

  9.  Jeg skrev eder til i mit Brev, at I ikke skulle have Samkvem med
      utugtige,
 10.  ikke i al Almindelighed denne Verdens utugtige eller havesyge og
      Røvere eller Afgudsdyrkere; ellers måtte I jo gå ud af Verden.
 11.  Men nu skrev jeg til eder, at I ikke skulle have Samkvem, om
      nogen, der har Navn af Broder, er en utugtig eller en havesyg
      eller en Afgudsdyrker eller en Skændegæst eller en Dranker eller
      en Røver, ja, end ikke spise sammen med en sådan.
 12.  Thi hvad kommer det mig ved at dømme dem, som ere udenfor? Dømme
      I ikke dem, som ere indenfor?
 13.  Men dem udenfor skal Gud dømme.Bortskaffer den onde fra eder
      selv!

1.Korinterne 6

  1.  Kan nogen af eder, når han har Sag med en anden, føre det over
      sit Sind at søge Dom hos de uretfærdige, og ikke hos de hellige?
  2.  Eller vide I ikke, at de hellige skulle dømme Verden? og når
      Verden dømmes ved eder, ere I da uværdige til at sidde til Doms
      i de ringeste Sager?
  3.  Vide I ikke, at vi skulle dømme Engle? end sige da i timelige
      Ting!
  4.  Når I da have Sager om timelige Ting, sætte I da dem til
      Dommere, som ere agtede for intet i Menigheden?
  5.  Til Skam for eder siger jeg det: Er der da slet ingen viis
      iblandt eder, som kan dømme sine Brødre imellem?
  6.  Men Broder fører Sag imod Broder, og det for vantro!
  7.  Overhovedet er jo allerede det en Fejl hos eder, at I have
      Retssager med hverandre. Hvorfor lide I ikke hellere Uret?
      hvorfor lade I eder ikke hellere plyndre?
  8.  Men I gøre Uret og plyndre, og det Brødre!
  9.  Eller vide I ikke, at uretfærdige skulle ikke arve Guds Rige?
      Farer ikke vild! Hverken utugtige eller Afgudsdyrkere eller
      Horkarle eller de som lade sig bruge til unaturlig Utugt, eller
      de, som øve den,
 10.  eller Tyve eller havesyge eller Drankere, ingen Skændegæster,
      ingen Røvere skulle arve Guds Rige.
 11.  Og sådanne vare I for en Del; men I lode eder aftvætte, ja, I
      bleve helligede, ja, I bleve retfærdiggjorte ved den Herres Jesu
      Navn og ved vor Guds Ånd.

 12.  Alt er mig tilladt, men ikke alt er gavnligt; alt er mig
      tilladt, men jeg skal ikke lade mig beherske af noget.
 13.  Maden er for Bugen og Bugen for Maden; men Gud skal tilintetgøre
      både denne og hin. Legemet derimod er ikke for Utugt, men for
      Herren, og Herren for Legemet;
 14.  og Gud har både oprejst Herren og skal oprejse os ved sin Kraft.
 15.  Vide I ikke, at eders Legemer ere Kristi Lemmer? Skal jeg da
      tage Kristi Lemmer og gøre Skøgelemmer deraf? Det være langt
      fra!
 16.  Eller vide I ikke, at den, som holder sig til Skøgen, er eet
      Legeme med hende?"Thi de to," hedder det,"skulle blive til eet
      Kød."
 17.  Men den, som holder sig til Herren, er een Ånd med ham.
 18.  Flyr Utugt! Enhver Synd, som et Menneske ellers gør, er uden for
      Legemet; men den, som bedriver Utugt, synder imod sit eget
      Legeme.
 19.  Eller vide I ikke, at eders Legeme er et Tempel for den
      Helligånd, som er i eder, hvilken I have fra Gud, og at I ikke
      ere eders egne?
 20.  Thi I bleve købte dyrt; ærer derfor Gud i eders Legeme!

1.Korinterne 7

  1.  Men hvad det angår, hvorom I skreve til mig, da er det godt for
      en Mand ikke at røre en Kvinde;
  2.  men for Utugts Skyld have hver Mand sin egen Hustru, og hver
      Kvinde have sin egen Mand.
  3.  Manden yde Hustruen sin Skyldighed; ligeledes også Hustruen
      Manden.
  4.  Hustruen råder ikke over sit eget Legeme, men Manden; ligeså
      råder heller ikke Manden over sit eget Legeme, men Hustruen.
  5.  Unddrager eder ikke hinanden, uden måske med fælles Samtykke,
      til en Tid, for at I kunne have Ro til Bønnen, og for så atter
      at være sammen, for at Satan ikke skal friste eder, fordi I ikke
      formå at være afholdende.
  6.  Men dette siger jeg som en Indrømmelse, ikke som en Befaling.
  7.  Jeg ønsker dog, at alle Mennesker måtte være, som jeg selv er;
      men hver har sin egen Nådegave fra Gud, den ene så, den anden
      så.

  8.  Til de ugifte og til Enkerne siger jeg, at det er godt for dem,
      om de forblive som jeg.
  9.  Men kunne de ikke være afholdende, da lad dem gifte sig; thi det
      er bedre at gifte sig end at lide Brynde.

 10.  Men de gifte byder ikke jeg, men Herren, at en Hustru ikke skal
      skille sig fra sin Mand; (11 men om hun virkeligt skiller sig
      fra ham, da forblive hun ugift eller forlige sig med Manden;) og
      at en Mand ikke skal forlade sin Hustru.

 12.  Men til de andre siger jeg, ikke Herren: Dersom nogen Broder har
      en vantro Hustru, og denne samtykker i at bo hos ham, så forlade
      han hende ikke!
 13.  Og dersom en Hustru har en vantro Mand, og denne samtykker i at
      bo hos hende, så forlade hun ikke Manden!
 14.  Thi den vantro Mand er helliget ved Hustruen, og den vantro
      Hustru er helliget ved Manden; ellers vare jo eders Børn urene,
      men nu ere de hellige.
 15.  Men skiller den vantro sig, så lad ham skille sig; ingen Broder
      eller Søster er trælbunden i sådanne Tilfælde; men Gud har
      kaldet os til Fred.
 16.  Thi hvad ved du, Hustru! om du kan frelse din Mand? eller hvad
      ved du, Mand! om du kan frelse din Hustru?
 17.  Kun vandre enhver således, som Herren har tildelt ham, som Gud
      har kaldet ham; og således forordner jeg i alle Menighederne.
 18.  Blev nogen kaldet som omskåren, han lade ikke Forhud drage over;
      er nogen kaldet som uomskåren, han lade sig ikke omskære!
 19.  Omskærelse har intet at sige, og Forhud har intet at sige, men
      det at holde Guds Bud.
 20.  Hver blive i den Stand, hvori han blev kaldet!
 21.  Blev du kaldet som Træl, da lad det ikke bekymre dig, men om du
      også kan blive fri, da gør hellere Brug deraf!
 22.  Thi den, der er kaldet i Herren som Træl, er Herrens frigivne;
      ligeså er den, der er kaldet som fri, Kristi Træl.
 23.  Dyrt bleve I købte, vorde ikke Menneskers Trælle!
 24.  I den Stand, hvori enhver blev kaldet, Brødre, deri blive han
      for Gud!

 25.  Men om Jomfruerne har jeg ikke nogen Befaling fra Herren, men
      giver min Mening til Hende som den, hvem Herren barmhjertigt har
      forundt at være troværdig.
 26.  Jeg mener altså dette, at det på Grund af den forhåndenværende
      Nød er godt for et Menneske at være således, som han er.
 27.  Er du bunden til en Kvinde, da søg ikke at blive løst; er du
      ikke bunden, da søg ikke en Hustru!
 28.  Men om du også gifter dig, synder du ikke; og om en Jomfru
      gifter sig, synder hun ikke; dog ville sådanne få Trængsel i
      Kødet. Men jeg skåner eder.
 29.  Men dette siger jeg eder, Brødre! at Tiden er kort, for at
      herefter både de, der have Hustruer, skulle være, som om de
      ingen have,
 30.  og de, der græde, som om de ikke græde, og de, der glæde sig,
      som om de ikke glæde sig, og de, der købe, som om de ikke
      besidde,
 31.  og de, der bruge denne Verden, som om de ikke gøre Brug af den;
      thi denne Verdens Skikkelse forgår.
 32.  Men jeg ønsker, at I må være uden Bekymring. Den ugifte er
      bekymret for de Ting, som høre Herren til, hvorledes han kan
      behage Herren;
 33.  men den gifte er bekymret for de Ting, som høre Verden til,
      hvorledes han kan behage Hustruen.
 34.  Og der er også Forskel imellem Hustruen og Jomfruen. Den ugifte
      er bekymret for de Ting, som høre Herren til, for at hun kan
      være hellig både på Legeme og Ånd; men den gifte er bekymret for
      det, som hører Verden til, hvor ledes hun kan behage Manden.
 35.  Men dette siger jeg til eders eget Gavn, ikke for at kaste en
      Snare om eder, men for at bevare Sømmelighed og en urokkelig
      Vedhængen ved Herren.
 36.  Men dersom nogen mener at volde sin ugifte Datter Skam, om hun
      sidder over Tiden, og det må så være, han gøre, hvad han vil,
      han synder ikke; lad dem gifte sig!
 37.  Men den, som står fast i sit Hjerte og ikke er tvungen, men har
      Rådighed over sin Villie og har besluttet dette i sit Hjerte at
      holde sin Datter ugift, han gør vel.
 38.  Altså, både den, som bortgifter sin Datter, gør vel, og den, som
      ikke bortgifter hende, gør bedre.

 39.  En Hustru er bunden, så længe hendes Mand lever; men dersom
      Manden sover hen, er hun fri til at gifte sig med hvem hun vil,
      kun at det sker i Herren.
 40.  Men lykkeligere er hun, om hun forbliver således, som hun er,
      efter min Mening; men også jeg mener at have Guds Ånd.

1.Korinterne 8

  1.  Men hvad Kødet fra Afgudsofrene angår, da vide vi, fordi vi alle
      have Kundskab (Kundskaben opblæser, men Kærligheden opbygger.
  2.  Dersom nogen tykkes at kende noget, han kender endnu ikke
      således, som man bør kende.
  3.  Men dersom nogen elsker Gud, han er kendt af ham.)
  4.  Hvad altså Spisningen af Offerkødet angår, da vide vi, at der er
      ingen, Afgud i Verden, og at der ingen Gud er uden een.
  5.  Thi om der end er såkaldte Guder, være sig i Himmelen eller på
      Jorden, som der jo er mange Guder og mange Herrer,
  6.  så er der for os dog kun een Gud, Faderen, af hvem alle Ting
      ere, og vi til ham, og een Herre, Jesus Kristus, ved hvem alle
      Ting ere, og vi ved ham.

  7.  Dog ikke alle have den Kundskab. Men der er nogle, som ifølge
      deres hidtidige Afgudsvane spise det som Afgudsofferkød, og
      deres Samvittighed, som er skrøbelig, besmittes.
  8.  Men Mad skal ikke bestemme vor Stilling over for Gud; hverken
      have vi Fortrin, om vi spise, eller stå tilbage, om vi ikke
      spise.
  9.  Men ser, til, at ikke denne eders Frihed skal blive til Anstød
      for de skrøbelige!
 10.  Thi dersom nogen ser dig, som har Kundskab, sidde til Bords i et
      Afgudshus, vil så ikke Samvittigheden hos den, som er skrøbelig,
      blive opbygget til at spise Afgudsofferkødet?
 11.  Den skrøbelige går jo til Grunde ved din Kundskab, Broderen, for
      hvis Skyld Kristus er død.
 12.  Men når I således Synde imod Brødrene og såre deres skrøbelige
      Samvittighed, Synde I imod Kristus.
 13.  Derfor, om Mad forarger min Broder, vil jeg aldrig i Evighed
      spise Kød, for at jeg ikke skal forarge min Broder.

1.Korinterne 9

  1.  Er jeg ikke fri? er jeg ikke Apostel? har jeg ikke set Jesus,
      vor Herre? er I ikke min Gerning i Herren?
  2.  Er jeg ikke Apostel for andre, så er jeg det dog i det mindste
      for eder; thi Seglet på min Apostelgerning ere I i Herren.
  3.  Dette er mit Forsvar imod dem, som bedømme mig.
  4.  Have vi ikke Ret til at spise og drikke?
  5.  Have vi ikke Ret til at føre en Søster med om som Hustru, som
      også de andre Apostle og Herrens Brødre og Kefas?
  6.  Eller have alene jeg og Barnabas ingen Ret til at lade være at
      arbejde?
  7.  Hvem tjener vel nogen Sinde i Krig på egen Sold? Hvem planter en
      Vingård og spiser ikke dens Frugt? Eller hvem vogter en Hjord og
      nyder ikke af Hjordens Mælk?
  8.  Taler jeg vel dette blot efter menneskelig Vis, eller siger ikke
      også Loven dette?
  9.  Thi i Mose Lov er der skrevet: "Du må ikke binde Munden til på
      en Okse, som tærsker." Er det Okserne, Gud bekymrer sig om,
 10.  eller siger han det ikke i hvert Tilfælde for vor Skyld? For vor
      Skyld blev det jo skrevet, fordi den, som pløjer, bør pløje i
      Håb, og den, som tærsker, bør gøre det i Håb om at få sin Del.
 11.  Når vi have sået eder de åndelige Ting, er det da noget stort,
      om vi høste eders timelige?
 12.  Dersom andre nyde sådan Ret over eder, kunde da vi ikke snarere?
      Dog have vi ikke brugt denne Ret; men vi tåle alt, for at vi
      ikke skulle lægge noget i Vejen for Kristi Evangelium.
 13.  Vide I ikke, at de, som udføre de hellige Tjenester, få deres
      Føde fra Helligdommen, de, som tjene ved Alteret, dele med
      Alteret?
 14.  Således har også Herren forordnet for dem, som forkynde
      Evangeliet, at de skulle leve af Evangeliet.
 15.  Jeg derimod har ikke gjort Brug af noget af dette. Jeg skriver
      dog ikke dette, for at det skal ske således med mig; thi jeg vil
      hellere dø, end at nogen skulde gøre min Ros til intet.
 16.  Thi om jeg forkynder Evangeliet, har jeg ikke noget at rose mig
      af; der påligger mig nemlig en Nødvendighed, thi ve mig, om jeg
      ikke forkynder det!
 17.  Gør jeg nemlig dette af fri Villie, så får jeg Løn; men har jeg
      imod min Villie fået en Husholdning betroet,
 18.  hvad er da min Løn? For at jeg, når jeg forkynder Evangeliet,
      skal fremsætte det for intet, så at jeg ikke gør Brug af min Ret
      i Evangeliet.

 19.  Thi skønt jeg er fri over for alle, har jeg dog gjort mig selv
      til Tjener for alle, for at jeg kunde vinde des flere.
 20.  Og jeg er bleven Jøderne som en Jøde, for at jeg kunde vinde
      Jøder; dem under Loven som en under Loven, skønt jeg ikke selv
      er under Loven, for at jeg kunde vinde dem, som ere under Loven;
 21.  dem uden for Loven som en uden for Loven, skønt jeg ikke er uden
      Lov for God, men under Kristi Lov, for at jeg kunde vinde dem,
      som ere uden for Loven.
 22.  Jeg er bleven skrøbelig for de skrøbelige, for at jeg kunde
      vinde de skrøbelige; jeg er bleven alt for alle, for at jeg i
      ethvert Fald kunde frelse nogle.
 23.  Men alt gør jeg for Evangeliets Skyld, for at jeg kan blive
      meddelagtig deri.

 24.  Vide I ikke, at de, som løbe på Banen, løbe vel alle, men ikkun
      een får Prisen? Således skulle I løbe, for at I kunne vinde den.
 25.  Enhver, som deltager i Kamplegene, er afholdende i alt; hine nu
      vel for at få en forkrænkelig Krans, men vi en uforkrænkelig.
 26.  Jeg løber derfor ikke som på det uvisse jeg fægter som en, der
      ikke slår i Luften;
 27.  men jeg bekæmper mit Legeme og holder det i Trældom, for at ikke
      jeg, som har prædiket for andre, selv skal blive forkastet.

1.Korinterne 10

  1.  Thi jeg vil ikke, Brødre, at I skulle være uvidende om, at vore
      Fædre vare alle under Skyen og gik alle igennem Havet
  2.  og bleve alle døbte til Moses i Skyen og i Havet
  3.  og spiste alle den samme åndelige Mad
  4.  og drak alle den samme åndelige Drik; thi de drak af en åndelig
      Klippe, som fulgte med; men Klippen var Kristus.
  5.  Alligevel fandt Gud ikke Behag i de fleste af dem; thi de bleve
      slagne ned i Ørkenen.
  6.  Men disse Ting skete som Forbilleder for os, for at vi ikke
      skulle begære, hvad ondt er, således som hine begærede.
  7.  Bliver ej heller Afgudsdyrkere som nogle af dem, ligesom der er
      skrevet: "Folket satte sig ned at spise og drikke, og de stode
      op at lege."
  8.  Lader os ej heller bedrive Utugt, som nogle af dem bedreve
      Utugt, og der faldt på een Dag tre og tyve Tusinde.
  9.  Lader os ej heller friste Herren, som nogle af dem fristede ham
      og bleve ødelagte af Slanger.
 10.  Knurrer ej heller, som nogle af dem knurrede og bleve ødelagte
      af Ødelæggeren.
 11.  Men dette skete dem forbilledligt, men det blev skrevet til
      Advarsel for os, til hvem Tidernes Ende er kommen.
 12.  Derfor den, som tykkes at stå, se til, at han ikke falder!
 13.  Der er ikke kommet andre end menneskelige Fristelser over eder,
      og trofast er Gud, som ikke vil tillade, at I fristes over Evne,
      men som sammen med Fristelsen vil skabe også Udgangen af den,
      for at I må kunne udholde den.

 14.  Derfor, mine elskede, flyr fra Afgudsdyrkelsen!
 15.  Jeg taler som til forstandige; dømmer selv, hvad jeg siger.
 16.  Velsignelsens Kalk, som vi velsigne, er den ikke Samfund med
      Kristi Blod? det Brød, som vi bryde, er det ikke Samfund med
      Kristi Legeme?
 17.  Fordi der er eet Brød, ere vi mange eet Legeme; thi vi få alle
      Del i det ene Brød.
 18.  Ser til Israel efter Kødet; have de, som spise Ofrene, ikke
      Samfund med Alteret?
 19.  Hvad siger jeg da? At Afgudsofferkød er noget? eller at en Afgud
      er noget?
 20.  Nej! men hvad Hedningerne ofre, ofre de til onde Ånder og ikke
      til Gud; men jeg vil ikke,at I skulle få Samfund med de onde
      Ånder.
 21.  I kunne ikke drikke Herrens Kalk og onde Ånders Kalk; I kunne
      ikke være delagtige i Herrens Bord og i onde Ånders Bord.
 22.  Eller skulle vi vække Herrens Nidkærhed? Mon vi ere stærkere end
      han?

 23.  Alt er tilladt, men ikke alt er gavnligt; alt er tilladt, men
      ikke alt opbygger.
 24.  Ingen søge sit eget, men Næstens!
 25.  Alt, hvad der sælges i Slagterbod, spiser det, uden at undersøge
      noget af Samvittigheds-Hensyn;
 26.  thi Herrens er Jorden og dens Fylde.
 27.  Dersom nogen af de vantro indbyder eder, og I ville gå derhen,
      da spiser alt det, som sættes for eder, uden at undersøge noget
      af Samvittigheds-Hensyn.
 28.  Men dersom nogen siger til eder: "Dette er Offerkød," da lad
      være at spise for hans Skyld, som gav det til Kende, og for
      Samvittighedens Skyld.
 29.  Samvittigheden siger jeg, ikke ens egen, men den andens; thi
      hvorfor skal min Frihed dømmes af en anden Samvittighed?
 30.  Dersom jeg nyder det med Taksigelse, hvorfor hører jeg da ilde
      for det, som jeg takker for?
 31.  Hvad enten I derfor spise eller drikke, eller hvad I gøre, da
      gører alt til Guds Ære!
 32.  Værer uden Anstød både for Jøder og Grækere og for Guds
      Menighed,
 33.  ligesom også jeg i alt stræber at tækkes alle, idet jeg ikke
      søger, hvad der gavner mig selv, men hvad der gavner de mange,
      for at de kunne frelses.  (Kap.11.) 1 Vorder mine Efterfølgere,
      ligesom også jeg er Kristi!

1.Korinterne 11
  2.  Men jeg roser eder, fordi I komme mig i Hu i alt og holde fast
      ved Overleveringerne, således som jeg har overleveret eder dem.
  3.  Men jeg vil, at I skulle vide, at Kristus er enhver Mands Hoved;
      men Manden er Kvindens Hoved; men Gud er Kristi Hoved.
  4.  Hver Mand, som beder eller profeterer med tildækket Hoved,
      beskæmmer sit Hoved.
  5.  Men hver Kvinde, som beder eller profeterer med utildækket
      Hoved, beskæmmer sit Hoved; thi det er lige det samme, som var
      hun raget.
  6.  Thi når en Kvinde ikke tildækker sig, så lad hende også klippe
      sit Hår af; men er det usømmeligt for en Kvinde at klippes eller
      rages, da tildække hun sig!  7Thi en Mand bør ikke tildække sit
      Hoved, efterdi han er Guds Billede og Ære; men Kvinden er
      Mandens Ære.
  8.  Mand er jo ikke af Kvinde, men Kvinde af Mand.
  9.  Ej heller er jo Mand skabt for Kvindens Skyld, men Kvinde for
      Mandens Skyld.
 10.  Derfor bør Kvinden have et Ærbødighedstegn på Hovedet for
      Englenes Skyld.
 11.  Dog er hverken Kvinde uden Mand eller Mand uden Kvinde i Herren.
 12.  Thi ligesom Kvinden er af Manden, således er også Manden ved
      Kvinden; men alt sammen er det af Gud.
 13.  Dømmer selv: Er det sømmeligt, at en Kvinde beder til Gud med
      utildækket Hoved?
 14.  Lærer ikke også selve Naturen eder, at når en Mand bærer langt
      Hår, er det ham en Vanære,
 15.  men når en Kvinde bærer langt Hår, er det hende en Ære; thi det
      lange Hår er givet hende som et Slør.
 16.  Men har nogen Lyst til at trættes herom, da have vi ikke sådan
      Skik, og Guds Menigheder ej heller.

 17.  Men idet jeg giver følgende Formaning, roser jeg ikke, at I
      komme sammen, ikke til det bedre, men til det værre.
 18.  For det første nemlig hører jeg, at når I komme sammen i
      Menighedsforsamling, er der Splittelser iblandt eder; og for en
      Del tror jeg det.
 19.  Thi der må endog være Partier iblandt eder, for at de prøvede
      kunne blive åbenbare iblandt eder.
 20.  Når I da komme sammen, er dette ikke at æde en Herrens Nadver.
 21.  Thi under Spisningen tager enhver sit eget Måltid forud, og den
      ene hungrer, den anden beruser sig.
 22.  Have I da ikke Huse til at spise og drikke i? eller foragte I
      Guds Menighed og beskæmme dem, som intet have? Hvad skal jeg
      sige eder?  Skal jeg rose eder? I dette roser jeg eder ikke.
 23.  Thi jeg har modtaget fra Herren, hvad jeg også har overleveret
      eder: At den Herre Jesus i den Nat, da han blev forrådt, tog
      Brød,
 24.  takkede og brød det og sagde: "Dette er mit Legeme, som er for
      eder; gører dette til min Ihukommelse!"
 25.  Ligeså tog han og,så Kalken efter Aftensmåltidet og sagde:
      "Denne Kalk er den nye Pagt i mit Blod; gører dette, så ofte som
      I drikke det, til min Ihukommelse!"
 26.  Thi så ofte, som I æde dette Brød og drikke Kalken, forkynde I
      Herrens Død, indtil han kommer.
 27.  Derfor, den, som æder Brødet eller drikker Herrens Kalk
      uværdigt, pådrager sig Skyld over for Herrens Legeme og Blod.
 28.  Men hvert Menneske prøve sig selv, og således æde han af Brødet
      og drikke af Kalken!
 29.  Thi den, som æder og drikker, æder og drikker sig selv en Dom
      til, når han ikke agter på Legenet.
 30.  Derfor ere mange skrøbelige og sygelige iblandt eder, og en Del
      sover hen.
 31.  Men dersom vi bedømte os selv, bleve vi ikke dømte.
 32.  Men når vi dømmes, tugtes vi af Herren, for at vi ikke skulle
      fordømmes med Verden.
 33.  Derfor, mine Brødre! når I komme sammen til Måltid, da venter på
      hverandre!
 34.  Når nogen hungrer, han spise hjemme, for at I ikke skulle komme
      sammen til Dom. Men det øvrige skal jeg forordne, når jeg
      kommer.

1.Korinterne 12

  1.  Men hvad de åndelige Gaver angår, Brødre! vil jeg ikke, at I
      skulle være uvidende.
  2.  I vide, at da I vare Hedninger, droges I hen til de stumme
      Afguder, som man drog eder.
  3.  Derfor kundgør jeg eder, at ingen, som taler ved Guds Ånd,
      siger: "Jesus er en Forbandelse," og ingen kan sige: "Jesus er
      Herre" uden ved den Helligånd.

  4.  Der er Forskel på Nådegaver, men det er den samme Ånd;
  5.  og der er Forskel på Tjenester, og det er den samme Herre;
  6.  og der er Forskel på kraftige Gerninger, men det er den samme
      Gud, som virker alt i alle.
  7.  Men til enhver gives Åndens Åbenbarelse til det, som er
      gavnligt.
  8.  En gives der nemlig ved Ånden Visdoms Tale; en anden Kundskabs
      Tale ifølge den samme Ånd;
  9.  en anden Tro i den samme Ånd; en anden Gaver til at helbrede i
      den ene Ånd;
 10.  en anden at udføre kraftige Gerninger; en anden profetisk Gave;
      en anden at bedømme Ånder; en anden forskellige Slags Tungetale;
      en anden Udlægning af Tungetale.
 11.  Men alt dette virker den ene og samme Ånd, som uddeler til
      enhver især; efter som han vil.

 12.  Thi ligesom Legemet er eet og har mange Lemmer, men alle
      Legemets Lemmer, skønt de ere mange, dog ere eet Legeme, således
      også Kristus.
 13.  Thi med een Ånd bleve vi jo alle døbte til at være eet Legeme,
      hvad enten vi ere Jøder eller Grækere, Trælle eller frie; og
      alle fik vi een Ånd at drikke
 14.  Legemet er jo heller ikke eet Lem, men mange.
 15.  Dersom Foden vilde sige: "Fordi jeg ikke er Hånd, hører jeg ikke
      til Legemet," så ophører den dog ikke derfor at høre til
      Legemet.
 16.  Og dersom Øret vilde sige: "Fordi jeg ikke er Øje, hører jeg
      ikke til Legemet," så ophører det dog ikke derfor at høre til
      Legemet.
 17.  Dersom hele Legemet var Øje, hvor blev da Hørelsen? Dersom det
      helt var Hørelse, hvor blev da Lugten?
 18.  Men nu har Gud sat Lemmerne, ethvert af dem, på Legemet, efter
      som han vilde.
 19.  Men dersom de alle vare eet Lem, hvor blev da Legemet?
 20.  Nu er der derimod mange Lemmer og dog kun eet Legeme.
 21.  Øjet kan ikke sige til Hånden: "Jeg har dig ikke nødig," eller
      atter Hovedet til Fødderne: "Jeg har eder ikke nødig."
 22.  Nej, langt snarere ere de Lemmer på Legemet nødvendige, som
      synes at være de svageste,
 23.  og de, som synes os mindre ærefolde på Legemet, dem klæde vi med
      des mere Ære; og de Lemmer, vi blues ved, omgives med desto
      større Blufærdighed;
 24.  de derimod, som vi ikke blues ved, have det ikke nødig. Men Gud
      har sammenføjet Legemet således, at han tillagde det ringere
      mere Ære;
 25.  for at der ikke skal være Splid i Legemet, men, for at Lemmerne
      skulle have samme Omsorg for hverandre;
 26.  og hvad enten eet Lem lider, lide alle Lemmerne med, eller eet
      Lem bliver hædret, glæde alle Lemmerne sig med.
 27.  Men I ere Kristi Legeme, og Lemmer enhver især.
 28.  Og nogle satte Gud i Menigheden for det første til Apostle, for
      det andet til Profeter, for det tredje til Lærere, dernæst
      kraftige Gerninger, dernæst Gaver til at helbrede. til at
      hjælpe, til at styre, og forskellige Slags Tungetale.
 29.  Mon alle ere Apostle? mon alle ere Profeter? mon alle ere
      Lærere?  mon alle gøre kraftige Gerninger?
 30.  mon alle have Gaver til at helbrede? mon alle tale i Tunger? mon
      alle udlægge?
 31.  Men tragter efter de største Nådegaver! Og yder mere viser jeg
      eder en ypperlig Vej.

1.Korinterne 13

  1.  Taler jeg med Menneskers og Engles Tunger, men ikke har
      Kærlighed, da er jeg bleven et lydende Malm eller en klingende
      Bjælde.
  2.  Og har jeg profetisk Gave og kender alle Hemmelighederne og al
      Kundskaben, og har jeg al Troen, så at jeg kan flytte Bjerge,
      men ikke har Kærlighed, da er jeg intet.
  3.  Og uddeler jeg alt, hvad jeg ejer, til de fattige og giver mit
      Legeme hen til at brændes, men ikke har Kærlighed, da gavner det
      mig intet.

  4.  Kærligheden er langmodig, er velvillig; Kærligheden bærer ikke
      Nid; Kærligheden praler ikke, opblæses ikke,
  5.  gør intet usømmeligt, søger ikke sit eget, forbitres ikke,
      tilregner ikke det onde;
  6.  glæder sig ikke over Uretfærdigheden, men glæder sig ved
      Sandheden;
  7.  den tåler alt, tror alt, håber alt, udholder alt.

  8.  Kærligheden bortfalder aldrig; men enten det er profetiske
      Gaver, de skulle forgå, eller Tungetale, den skal ophøre, eller
      Kundskab, den skal forgå;
  9.  thi vi kende stykkevis og profetere stykkevis;
 10.  men når det fuldkomne kommer, da skal det stykkevise forgå.
 11.  Da jeg var Barn, talte jeg som et Barn, tænkte jeg som et Barn,
      dømte jeg som et Barn; efter at jeg er bleven Mand, har jeg
      aflagt det barnagtige.
 12.  Nu se vi jo i et Spejl, i en Gåde, men da skulle vi se Ansigt
      til Ansigt; nu kender jeg stykkevis, men da skal jeg erkende,
      ligesom jeg jo blev erkendt.
 13.  Så blive da Tro, Håb, Kærlighed disse tre; men størst iblandt
      disse er Kærligheden.

1.Korinterne 14

  1.  Higer efter Kærligheden, og tragter efter de åndelige Gaver men
      mest efter at profetere.
  2.  Thi den; som taler i Tunger, taler ikke for Mennesker, men for
      Gud; thi ingen forstår det, men han taler Hemmeligheder i Ånden.
  3.  Men den, som profeterer, taler Mennesker til Opbyggelse og
      Formaning og Trøst.
  4.  Den, som taler i Tunger, opbygger sig selv; men den, som
      profeterer, opbygger en Menighed.
  5.  Men jeg ønsker, at I alle måtte tale i Tunger, men endnu
      hellere, at I måtte profetere; den, som profeterer, er større
      end den, som taler i Tunger, med mindre han udlægger det, for at
      Menigheden kan få Opbyggelse deraf.
  6.  Men nu, Brødre! dersom jeg kommer til eder og taler i Tunger,
      hvad vil jeg da gavne eder, hvis jeg ikke taler til eder enten
      ved Åbenbaring eller ved Kundskab, enten ved Profeti eller ved
      Lære?
  7.  Selv de livløse Ting, som give Lyd, være sig en Fløjte eller en
      Harpe, når de ikke gøre Skel imellem Tonerne, hvorledes skal man
      så kunne forstå, hvad der spilles på Fløjten eller Harpen?
  8.  Ja, også når en Basun giver en utydelig Lyd, hvem vil da berede
      sig til Krig?
  9.  Således også med eder: dersom I ikke ved Tungen fremføre tydelig
      Tale, hvorledes skal man da kunne forstå det, som tales? I ville
      jo tale hen i Vejret.
 10.  Der er i Verden, lad os sige, så og så mange Slags Sprog, og der
      er intet af dem, som ikke har sin Betydning.
 11.  Dersom jeg nu ikke kender Sprogets Betydning, bliver jeg en
      Barbar for den, som taler, og den, som taler, bliver en Barbar
      for mig.
 12.  Således også med eder: når I tragte efter åndelige Gaver, da lad
      det være til Menighedens Opbyggelse, at I søge at blive rige
      derpå
 13.  " Derfor, den, som taler i Tunger, han bede om, at han må kunne
      udlægge det.
 14.  Thi dersom: jeg taler i Tunger og beder, da beder. vel min Ånd,
      men min Forstand er uden Frugt.
 15.  Hvad da? Jeg vil bede med Ånden, men jeg vil også bede med
      Forstanden; jeg vil lovsynge med Ånden, men jeg vil også
      lovsynge med Forstanden.
 16.  Ellers, når du priser Gud i Ånden, hvorledes vil da den, som
      indtager den uindviedes Plads, kunne sige sit Amen til din
      Taksigelse, efterdi han ikke ved, hvad du siger?
 17.  Thi vel er din Taksigelse smuk, men den anden opbygges ikke.
 18.  Jeg takker Gud for, at jeg mere end I alle taler i Tunger.
 19.  Men i en Menighed vil jeg hellere tale fem Ord med min Forstand,
      for at jeg også kan undervise andre, end ti Tusinde Ord i
      Tunger.
 20.  Brødre! vorder ikke Børn i Forstand, men værer Børn i Ondskab, i
      Forstand derimod vorder fuldvoksne!
 21.  Der er skrevet i Loven: "Ved Folk med fremmede Tungemål og ved
      fremmedes Læber vil jeg tale til dette Folk, og de skulle end
      ikke således høre mig, siger Herren."
 22.  Således er Tungetalen til et Tegn, ikke for dem, som tro, men
      for de vantro; men den profetiske Gave er det ikke for de
      vantro, men for dem, som tro.
 23.  Når altså den hele Menighed kommer sammen, og alle tale i
      Tunger, men der kommer uindviede eller vantro ind, ville de da
      ikke sige, at I rase?
 24.  Men dersom alle profetere, og der kommer nogen vantro eller
      uindviet ind, da overbevises han af alle, han bedømmes af alle,
 25.  hans Hjertes skjulte Tanker åbenbares, og så vil han falde på
      sit Ansigt og tilbede Gud og forkynde, at Gud er virkelig i
      eder.

 26.  Hvad da Brødre? Når I komme sammen, da har enhver en Lovsang, en
      Lære, en Åbenbaring, en Tungetale, en Udlægning; alt ske til
      Opbyggelse!
 27.  Dersom nogen taler i Tunger, da være det to, eller i det højeste
      tre hver Gang, og den ene efter den anden, og een udlægge det!
 28.  Men dersom der ingen Udlægger er til Stede, da tie hin i
      Menigheden, men han tale for sig selv og for Gud!
 29.  Men af Profeter tale to eller tre, og de andre bedømme det;
 30.  men dersom en anden, som sidder der, får en Åbenbarelse, da tie
      den første!
 31.  Thi I kunne alle profetere, den ene efter den anden, for at alle
      kunne lære, og alle blive formanede,
 32.  og Profeters Ånder ere Profeter undergivne.
 33.  Thi Gud er ikke Forvirringens, men Fredens Gud. Ligesom i alle
      de helliges Menigheder

 34.  skulle eders Kvinder tie i Forsamlingerne; thi det tilstedes dem
      ikke at tale, men lad dem underordne sig, ligesom også Loven
      siger.
 35.  Men ville de lære noget, da adspørge de deres egne Mænd hjemme;
      thi det er usømmeligt for en Kvinde at tale i en
      Menighedsforsamling.
 36.  Eller er det fra eder, at Guds Ord er udgået? eller er det til
      eder alene, at det er kommet?

 37.  Dersom nogen tykkes, at han er en Profet eller åndelig, han
      erkende, at hvad jeg skriver til eder, er Herrens Bud.
 38.  Men er nogen uvidende derom, så får han være uvidende!
 39.  Altså, mine Brødre! tragter efter at profetere og forhindrer
      ikke Talen i Tunger!
 40.  Men alt ske sømmeligt og med Orden!

1.Korinterne 15

  1.  Men jeg kundgør eder, Brødre, det Evangelium, som jeg Forkyndte
      eder, hvilket I også modtoge, i hvilket I også stå,
  2.  ved hvilket I også frelses, hvis I fastholde, med hvilket Ord
      jeg forkyndte eder det - ellers troede I forgæves.
  3.  Jeg overleverede eder nemlig som noget af det første, hvad jeg
      også har modtaget: at Kristus døde for vore Synder,efter
      Skrifterne;
  4.  og at han blev begravet; og at han er bleven oprejst den tredje
      Dag, efter Skrifterne;
  5.  og at han blev set af Kefas, derefter af de tolv;
  6.  derefter blev han set af over fem Hundrede Brødre på een Gang,
      af hvilke de fleste endnu ere i Live, men nogle ere hensovede;.
  7.  derefter blev han set af Jakob, dernæst af alle Apostlene;
  8.  men sidst af alle blev han set også af mig som det ufuldbårne
      Foster;
  9.  thi jeg er den ringeste af Apostlene, jeg, som ikke er værd at
      kaldes Apostel, fordi jeg har forfulgt Guds Menighed.
 10.  Men af Guds Nåde er jeg det, jeg er, og hans Nåde imod mig har
      ikke været forgæves; men jeg har arbejdet mere end de alle, dog
      ikke jeg, men Guds Nåde, som er med mig.
 11.  Hvad enten det da er mig eller de andre, således prædike vi, og
      således troede I.

 12.  Men når der prædikes, at Kristus er oprejst fra de døde,
      hvorledes sige da nogle iblandt eder, at der ikke er dødes
      Opstandelse?
 13.  Dersom der ikke er dødes Opstandelse, da er ikke heller Kristus
      oprejst.
 14.  Men er Kristus ikke oprejst, da er vor Prædiken jo tom, og eders
      Tro også tom.
 15.  Men vi blive da også fundne som falske Vidner om Gud, fordi vi
      have vidnet imod Gud, at han oprejste Kristus, hvem han ikke har
      oprejst, såfremt døde virkelig ikke oprejses.
 16.  Thi dersom døde ikke oprejses, da er Kristus ikke heller
      oprejst.
 17.  Men dersom Kristus ikke er oprejst, da er eders Tro forgæves; så
      ere I endnu i eders Synder;
 18.  da gik altså også de, som ere hensovede i Kristus, fortabt.
 19.  Have vi alene i dette Liv sat vort Håb til Kristus, da ere vi de
      ynkværdigste af alle Mennesker.
 20.  Men nu er Kristus oprejst fra de døde, som Førstegrøde af de
      hensovede.
 21.  Thi efterdi Død kom ved et Menneske, er også dødes Opstandelse
      kommen ved et Menneske.
 22.  Thi ligesom alle dø i Adam, således skulle også alle
      levendegøres i Kristus.
 23.  Dog hver i sit Hold: som Førstegrøde Kristus, dernæst de, som
      tilhøre Kristus, ved hans Tilkommelse.
 24.  Derpå kommer Enden, når han overgiver Gud og Faderen Riget, når
      han har tilintetgjort hver Magt og hver Myndighed og Kraft.
 25.  Thi han bør være Konge, indtil han får lagt alle Fjenderne under
      sine Fødder.
 26.  Den sidste Fjende, som tilintetgøres, er Døden.
 27.  Han har jo "lagt alle Ting under hans Fødder." Men når han"
      siger: "Alt er underlagt" - åbenbart med Undtagelse af den, som
      underlagde ham alt -
 28.  når da alle Ting ere blevne ham underlagte, da skal også Sønnen
      selv underlægge sig ham, som har underlagt ham alle Ting, for at
      Gud kan være alt i alle.

 29.  Hvad ville ellers de udrette, som lade sig døbe for de døde?
      Dersom døde overhovedet ikke oprejses, hvorfor lade de sig da
      døbe for dem?
 30.  Hvorfor udsætte da også vi os hver Time for Fare?
 31.  Jeg dør daglig, så sandt jeg har eder, Brødre, at rose mig af i
      Kristus Jesus, vor Herre.
 32.  Hvis jeg som et almindeligt Menneske har kæmpet med vilde Dyr i
      Efesus, hvad Gavn har jeg så deraf? Dersom døde ikke oprejses,
      da "lader os spise og drikke, thi i Morgen dø vi."
 33.  Farer ikke vild; slet Omgang fordærver gode Sæder!
 34.  Vorder ædrue, som det bør sig, og synder ikke; thi nogle kende
      ikke Gud; til Skam for eder siger jeg det.

 35.  Men man vil sige: "Hvorledes oprejses de døde? hvad Slags Legeme
      komme de med?"
 36.  Du Dåre! det, som du sår, bliver ikke levendegjort, dersom det
      ikke dør.
 37.  Og hvad du end sår, da sår du ikke det Legeme, der skal vorde,
      men et nøgent Korn, være sig af Hvede eller af anden Art.
 38.  Men Gud giver det et Legeme, således som han har villet, og hver
      Sædart sit eget Legeme.
 39.  Ikke alt Kød er det samme Kød, men eet er Menneskers, et andet
      Kvægs Kød, et andet Fugles Kød, et andet Fisks.
 40.  Og der er himmelske Legemer og jordiske Legemer; men een er de
      himmelskes Herlighed, en anden de jordiskes.
 41.  Een er Solens Glans og en anden Månens Glans og en anden
      Stjernernes Glans; thi den ene Stjerne er forskellig fra den
      anden i Glans.
 42.  Således er det også med de dødes Opstandelse: det såes i
      Forkrænkelighed, det oprejses i Uforkrænkelighed;
 43.  det såes i Vanære, det oprejses i Herlighed; det såes i
      Skrøbelighed, det oprejses i Kraft;
 44.  der såes et sjæleligt Legeme, der oprejses et åndeligt Legeme.
      Når der gives et sjæleligt Legeme, gives der også et åndeligt.
 45.  Således er der også skrevet: "Det første Menneske, Adam, blev
      til en levende Sjæl;"den sidste Adam blev til en levendegørende
      Ånd.
 46.  Men det åndelige er ikke det første, men det sjælelige; derefter
      det åndelige.
 47.  Det første Menneske var af Jord, jordisk; det andet Menneske er
      fra Himmelen.
 48.  Sådan som den jordiske var, sådanne ere også de jordiske; og
      sådan som den himmelske er, sådanne ere også de himmelske.
 49.  Og ligesom vi have båret den jordiskes Billede, således skulle
      vi også bære den himmelskes Billede!

 50.  Men dette siger jeg, Brødre! at Kød og Blod kan ikke arve Guds
      Rige, ej heller arver Forkrænkeligheden Uforkrænkeligheden.
 51.  Se, jeg siger eder en Hemmelighed: Alle skulle vi ikke hensove,
      men vi skulle alle forvandles
 52.  i et Nu, i et Øjeblik, ved den sidste Basun; thi Basunen skal
      lyde, og de døde skulle oprejses uforkrænkelige, og vi skulle
      forvandles.
 53.  Thi dette forkrænkelige må iføre sig Uforkrænkelighed, og dette
      dødelige iføre sig Udødelighed.
 54.  Men når dette forkrænkelige har iført sig Uforkrænkelighed, og
      dette dødelige har iført sig Udødelighed, da skal det Ord
      opfyldes, som er skrevet: "Døden er opslugt til Sejr."
 55.  "Død, hvor er din Sejr? Død, hvor er din Brod?"
 56.  Men Dødens Brod er Synden, og Syndens Kraft er Loven.
 57.  Men Gud ske Tak, som giver os Sejren ved vor Herre Jesus
      Kristus!
 58.  Derfor, mine elskede Brødre! bliver faste, urokkelige, altid
      rige i Herrens Gerning, vidende, at eders Arbejde er ikke
      forgæves i Herren.

1.Korinterne 16

  1.  Men hvad Indsamlingen til de hellige angår, da gører også I,
      ligesom jeg forordnede for Menighederne i Galatien!
  2.  Hver første Dag i Ugen lægge enhver af eder hjemme hos sig selv
      noget til Side og samle, hvad han måtte have Lykke til, for at
      der ikke først skal ske Indsamlinger, når jeg kommer.
  3.  Men når jeg kommer, vil jeg sende, hvem I måtte finde skikkede
      dertil, med Breve for at bringe eders Gave til Jerusalem.
  4.  Men dersom det er værd, at også jeg rejser med, da kunne de
      rejse med mig.

  5.  Men jeg vil komme til eder, når jeg er dragen igennem
      Makedonien; thi jeg drager igennem Makedonien;
  6.  men hos eder vil jeg måske blive eller endog overvintre, for at
      I kunne befordre mig videre, hvor jeg så rejser hen.
  7.  Thi nu vil jeg ikke se eder på Gennemrejse; jeg håber nemlig at
      forblive nogen Tid hos eder, om Herren vil tilstede det.
  8.  Men i Efesus vil jeg forblive indtil Pinsen;
  9.  thi en Dør står mig åben, stor og virksom, og der er mange
      Modstandere.

 10.  Men om Timotheus kommer, da ser til, at han kan færdes hos eder
      uden Frygt; thi han gør Herrens Gerning, såvel som jeg.
 11.  Derfor må ingen ringeagte ham; befordrer ham videre i Fred, for
      at han kan komme til mig; thi jeg venter ham med Brødrene.
 12.  Men hvad Broderen Apollos angår, da har jeg meget opfordret ham
      til at komme til eder med Brødrene; men det var i hvert Fald
      ikke hans Villie at komme nu, men han vil komme, når han får
      belejlig Tid.


 13.  Våger, står faste i Troen, værer mandige, værer stærke!
 14.  Alt ske hos eder i Kærlighed!

 15.  Men jeg formaner eder, Brødre - I kende Stefanas's Hus, at det
      er Akajas Førstegrøde, og de have hengivet sig selv til at tjene
      de hellige -
 16.  til at også I skulle underordne eder under sådanne og enhver,
      som arbejder med og har Besvær.
 17.  Men jeg glæder mig ved Stefanas's og Fortunatus's og Akaikus's
      Nærværelse, fordi disse have udfyldt Savnet af eder;
 18.  thi de have vederkvæget min Ånd og eders. Skønner derfor på
      sådanne!

 19.  Menighederne i Asien hilse eder. Akvila og Priska hilse eder
      meget i Herren tillige med Menigheden i deres Hus.
 20.  Alle Brødrene hilse eder. Hilser hverandre med et helligt Kys!

 21.  Hilsenen med min, Paulus's egen Hånd.
 22.  Dersom nogen ikke elsker Herren, han være en Forbandelse! Maran
      Atha.
 23.  Den Herres Jesu Nåde være med eder!
 24.  Min Kærlighed med eder alle i Kristus Jesus!


2.Korinterne

2.Korinterne 1

  1.  Paulus, ved Guds Villie Kristi Jesu Apostel, og Broderen
      Timotheus til Guds Menighed, som er i Korinth, tillige med alle
      de hellige, som ere i hele Akaja:
  2.  Nåde være med eder og Fred fra Gud vor Fader og den Herre Jesus
      Kristus!

  3.  Lovet være Gud og vor Herres Jesu Kristi Fader,
      Barmhjertighedens Fader og al Trøsts Gud,
  4.  som trøster os under al vor Trængsel, for at vi må kunne trøste
      dem, som ere i alle Hånde Trængsel, med den Trøst, hvormed vi
      selv trøstes af Gud!
  5.  Thi ligesom Kristi Lidelser komme rigeligt over os, således
      bliver også vor Trøst rigelig ved Kristus.
  6.  Men hvad enten vi lide Trængsel, sker det til eders Trøst og
      Frelse, eller vi trøstes, sker det til eders Trøst, som viser
      sin Kraft i, at I udholde de samme Lidelser, som også vi lide;
      og vort Håb om eder er fast,
  7.  efterdi vi vide, at ligesom I ere delagtige i Lidelserne,
      således ere I det også i Trøsten.
  8.  Thi vi ville ikke, Brødre! at I skulle være uvidende om den
      Trængsel, som kom over os i Asien, at vi bleve overvættes
      besværede, over Evne, så at vi endog mistvivlede om Livet.
  9.  Ja, selv have vi hos os selv fået det Svar: "Døden", for at vi
      ikke skulde forlade os på os selv, men på Gud, som oprejser de
      døde,
 10.  han, som friede os ud af så stor en Dødsfare og vil fri os, til
      hvem vi have sat vort Håb, at han også fremdeles vil fri os,
 11.  idet også I komme os til Hjælp med Bøn for os, for at der fra
      mange Munde må blive rigeligt takket for os, for den Nåde, som
      er bevist os.

 12.  Thi dette er vor Ros, vor Samvittigheds Vidnesbyrd, at i Guds
      Hellighed og Renhed, ikke i kødelig Visdom, men i Guds Nåde have
      vi færdedes i Verden, men mest hos eder.
 13.  Thi vi skrive eder ikke andet til end det, som I læse eller også
      erkende; men jeg håber, at I indtil Enden skulle erkende,
 14.  ligesom I også til Dels have erkendt om os, at vi ere eders Ros,
      ligesom I ere vor, på den Herres Jesu Dag.
 15.  Og i Tillid hertil havde jeg i Sinde at komme først til eder,
      for at I skulde få Nåde to Gange,
 16.  og om ad eder at drage til Makedonien og atter fra Makedonien at
      komme til eder og blive befordret videre af eder til Judæa.
 17.  Når jeg nu havde dette i Sinde, mon jeg da så handlede i
      Letsindighed? Eller hvad jeg beslutter, beslutter jeg det efter
      Kødet, for at der hos mig skal være Ja, Ja og Nej, Nej?
 18.  Så sandt Gud er trofast, er vor Tale til eder ikke Ja og Nej.
 19.  Thi Guds Søn, Kristus Jesus, som blev prædiket iblandt eder ved
      os, ved mig og Silvanus og Timotheus, han blev ikke Ja og Nej,
      men Ja er vorden i ham.
 20.  Thi så mange, som Guds Forjættelser ere, i ham have de deres Ja;
      derfor få de også ved ham deres Amen, Gud til Ære ved os.
 21.  Men den, som holder os med eder fast til Kristus og salvede os,
      er Gud,
 22.  som også beseglede os og gav os Åndens Pant i vore Hjerter.
 23.  Men jeg kalder Gud til Vidne over min Sjæl på, at det var for at
      skåne eder, at jeg ikke igen kom til Korinth.
 24.  Ikke at vi ere Herrer over eders Tro, men vi ere Medarbejdere på
      eders Glæde; thi i Troen stå I.

2.Korinterne 2

  1.  Men jeg beslutte dette hos mig selv, at jeg vilde ikke atter
      komme til eder med Bedrøvelse.
  2.  Thi dersom jeg bedrøver eder, hvem er da den, som gør mig glad,
      uden den, som bedrøves af mig?
  3.  Og jeg skrev netop derfor, for at jeg ikke, når jeg kom, skulde
      have Bedrøvelse af dem, som jeg burde have Glæde af, idet jeg
      havde den Tillid til eder alle, at min Glæde deles af eder alle.
  4.  Thi ud af stor Hjertets Trængsel og Beklemthed skrev jeg eder
      til, under mange Tårer, ikke for at I skulde blive bedrøvede,
      men for at I skulde kende den Kærlighed, som jeg har særlig til
      eder.

  5.  Men dersom nogen har voldt Bedrøvelse, har han ikke bedrøvet
      mig, men til Dels, for ikke at sige det hårdere, eder alle.
  6.  Det er nok for ham med denne Straf, som han har fået af de
      fleste,
  7.  så at I tværtimod snarere skulle tilgive og trøste ham, for at
      han ikke skal drukne i den alt for store Bedrøvelse.
  8.  Derfor formaner jeg eder til at vedtage at vise ham Kærlighed.
  9.  Det var nemlig også derfor, at jeg skrev, for at erfare, hvor
      vidt I stå Prøve, om I ere lydige i alt.
 10.  Men hvem I tilgive noget, ham tilgiver også jeg; thi også hvad
      jeg selv har tilgivet, om jeg har tilgivet noget, det har jeg
      gjort for eders Skyld, for Kristi Åsyn,
 11.  for at vi ikke skulle bedrages af Satan; thi hans Anslag ere os
      ikke ubekendte.

 12.  Da jeg kom til Troas for at prædike Kristi Evangelium, og der
      var åbnet mig en Dør i Herren,
 13.  da havde jeg ingen Ro i min Ånd, fordi jeg ikke fandt Titus, min
      Broder; men jeg tog Afsked med dem og drog til Makedonien.
 14.  Men Gud ske Tak, som altid fører os i Sejrstog i Kristus og
      lader sin Kundskabs Duft blive kendelig ved os på ethvert Sted.
 15.  Thi en Kristi Vellugt ere vi for Gud, iblandt dem, som frelses,
      og iblandt dem, som fortabes,
 16.  for disse en Duft af Død til Død, for hine en Duft af Liv til
      Liv.  Og hvem er dygtig dertil?
 17.  Thi vi ere ikke som de mange, at vi gøre en Forretning af Guds
      Ord, men som af Renhed, som af Gud tale vi for Guds Åsyn i
      Kristus.

2.Korinterne 3

  1.  Begynde vi atter at anbefale os selv? eller behøve vi, som
      nogle, Anbefalingsbreve til eder eller fra eder?
  2.  I ere vort Brev, som er indskrevet i vore Hjerter, og som kendes
      og læses af alle Mennesker,
  3.  idet det ligger klart som Dagen, at I ere et Kristi Brev,
      udfærdiget af os, indskrevet ikke med Blæk, men med den levende
      Guds Ånd, ikke på Stentavler, men på Hjerters Kødtavler.

  4.  Men en sådan Tillid have vi til Gud ved Kristus,
  5.  ikke at vi af os selv ere dygtige til at udtænke noget som ud af
      os selv; men vor Dygtighed er af Gud,
  6.  som også gjorde os dygtige til at være en ny Pagts Tjenere, ikke
      Bogstavens, men Åndens; thi Bogstaven ihjelslår, men Ånden
      levendegør.
  7.  Men når Dødens Tjeneste, med Bogstaver indristet i Sten,
      fremtrådte i Herlighed, så at Israels Børn ikke kunde fæste Øjet
      på Moses's Ansigt på Grund af hans Ansigts Herlighed, som dog
      forsvandt,
  8.  hvorledes skal da ikke Åndens Tjeneste end mere være i
      Herlighed?
  9.  Thi når Fordømmelsens Tjeneste havde Herlighed, er meget mere
      Retfærdighedens Tjeneste rig på Herlighed.
 10.  Ja, det herlige er jo i dette Tilfælde endog uden Herlighed i
      Sammenligning med den endnu større Herlighed.
 11.  Thi når det, der forsvandt, fremtrådte med Herlighed, da skal
      meget mere det, der bliver, være i Herlighed.
 12.  Efterdi vi altså have et sådant Håb, gå vi frem med stor
      Frimodighed
 13.  og gøre ikke som Moses, der lagde et Dække over sit Ansigt, for
      at Israels Børn ikke skulde fæste Øjet på, at det, der
      forsvandt, fik Ende.
 14.  Men deres Tanker bleve forhærdede; thi indtil den Dag i Dag
      forbliver det samme Dække over Oplæsningen af den gamle Pagt
      uden at tages bort; thi i Kristus er det, at det svinder.
 15.  Men der ligger indtil denne Dag et Dække over deres Hjerte, når
      Moses oplæses;
 16.  når de derimod omvende sig til Herren, da borttages Dækket.
 17.  Men Herren er Ånden, og hvor Herrens Ånd er, er der Frihed.
 18.  Men alle vi, som med ubedækket Ansigt skue Herrens Herlighed som
      i et Spejl, blive forvandlede til det samme Billede, fra
      Herlighed til Herlighed, så som det er fra Åndens Herre.

2.Korinterne 4

  1.  Derfor, da vi have denne Tjeneste efter den Barmhjertighed, som
      er bleven os til Del, så tabe vi ikke Modet;
  2.  men vi have frasagt os de skammelige Smugveje, så vi ikke vandre
      i Træskhed, ej heller forfalske Guds Ord, men ved Sandhedens
      Åbenbarelse anbefale os til alle Menneskers Samvittighed for
      Guds Åsyn.
  3.  Men om også vort Evangelium er tildækket, da er det tildækket
      iblandt dem, som fortabes,
  4.  dem, i hvem denne Verdens Gud har forblindet de vantros Tanker,
      for at Lyset ikke skulde skinne fra Evangeliet om Kristi
      Herlighed, han, som er Guds Billede.
  5.  Thi ikke os selv prædike vi, men Kristus Jesus som Herre, os
      derimod som eders Tjenere for Jesu Skyld.
  6.  Thi Gud, som sagde: "Af Mørke skal Lys skinne frem", han har
      ladet det skinne i vore Hjerter for, at bringe Kundskaben om
      Guds Herlighed på Kristi Åsyn for Lyset.

  7.  Men denne Skat have vi i Lerkar, for at den overvættes Kraft må
      være Guds, og ikke fra os,
  8.  vi, som trænges på alle Måder, men ikke stænges inde, ere
      tvivlrådige, men ikke fortvivlede,
  9.  forfulgte, men ikke forladte, nedslagne, men ikke ihjelslagne,
 10.  altid bærende Jesu Dødelse om i Legemet, for at også Jesu Liv må
      åbenbares i vort Legeme.
 11.  Thi altid overgives vi, som leve, til Død for Jesu Skyld, for at
      også Jesu Liv må åbenbares i vort dødelige Kød.
 12.  Således er Døden virksom i os, men Livet i eder!

 13.  Men efterdi vi have den samme Troens Ånd, som der er skrevet:
      "Jeg troede, derfor talte jeg," så tro også vi, og derfor tale
      vi også,
 14.  idet vi vide, at han, som oprejste den Herre Jesus, skal også
      oprejse os med Jesus og fremstille os tillige med eder.
 15.  Thi det sker alt sammen for eders Skyld, for at Nåden må vokse
      ved at nå til flere, og til Guds Ære forøge Taksigelsen.
 16.  Derfor tabe vi ikke Modet; men om også vort udvortes Menneske
      fortæres, fornyes dog vort indvortes Dag for Dag.
 17.  Thi vor Trængsel, som er stakket og let, virker for os over al
      Måde og Mål en evig Vægt af Herlighed,
 18.  idet vi ikke se på de synlige Ting, men på de usynlige; thi de
      synlige ere timelige, men de usynlige ere evige.

2.Korinterne 5

  1.  Thi vi vide, at dersom vor jordiske Teltbolig nedbrydes, have vi
      en Bygning fra Gud, en Bolig, som ikke er gjort med Hænder, en
      evig i Himlene.
  2.  Ja, også i denne sukke vi, længselsfulde efter at overklædes med
      vor Bolig fra Himmelen,
  3.  så sandt vi da som iklædte ikke skulle findes nøgne.
  4.  Ja, vi, som ere i dette Telt, sukke; besværede, efterdi vi ikke
      ville afklædes, men overklædes, for at det dødelige kan blive
      opslugt af Livet.
  5.  Men den, som har sat os i Stand just til dette, er Gud, som gav
      os Åndens Pant.
  6.  Derfor ere vi altid frimodige og vide, at medens vi ere hjemme i
      Legemet, ere vi borte fra Herren
  7.  thi i Tro vandre vi, ikke i Beskuelse
  8.  ja, vi ere frimodige og have snarere Lyst til at vandre bort fra
      Legemet og være hjemme hos Herren.
  9.  Derfor sætte vi også vor Ære i, hvad enten vi ere hjemme eller
      borte, at være ham velbehagelige.
 10.  Thi vi skulle alle åbenbares for Kristi Domstol, for at hver kan
      få igen, hvad der ved Legemet er gjort, efter det, som han har
      øvet, enten godt eller ondt.

 11.  Efterdi vi da kende Frygten for Herren, søge vi at vinde
      Mennesker; men for Gud ere vi åbenbare; ja, jeg håber, at vi
      også ere åbenbare for eders Samvittigheder.
 12.  Ikke anbefale vi atter os selv til eder; men vi give eder
      Anledning til at rose eder af os, for at I, kunne have noget at
      svare dem, som rose sig af det udvortes og ikke af Hjertet.
 13.  Thi når vi "bleve afsindige"; var det for Guds Skyld, og når vi
      ere besindige, er det for eders Skyld.
 14.  Thi Kristi Kærlighed tvinger os,
 15.  idet vi have sluttet således: Een er død for alle, altså ere de
      alle døde; og han døde for alle, for at de levende ikke mere
      skulle leve for sig selv, men for ham, som er død og oprejst for
      dem.
 16.  Således vide vi fra nu af ikke af nogen efter Kødet; om vi også
      have kendt Kristus efter Kødet, gøre vi det dog ikke mere nu.
 17.  Derfor, om nogen er i Kristus, da er han en ny Skabning; det
      gamle er forbigangent, se, det er blevet nyt!
 18.  Men alt dette er fra Gud, som forligte os med sig selv ved
      Kristus og gav os Forligelsens Tjeneste,
 19.  efterdi det jo var Gud, som i Kristus forligte Verden med sig
      selv, idet han ikke tilregner dem deres Overtrædelser og har
      nedlagt Forligelsens Ord i os.
 20.  Vi ere altså Sendebud i Kristi Sted, som om Gud formaner ved os;
      vi bede i Kristi Sted: Bliver forligte med Gud!
 21.  Den, som ikke kendte Synd, har han gjort til Synd for os, for at
      vi skulle blive Guds Retfærdighed i ham.

2.Korinterne 6

  1.  Men som Medarbejdere formane vi også til, at I ikke forgæves må
      have modtaget Guds Nåde;
  2.  (han siger jo: "På en behagelig Tid bønhørte jeg dig, og på en
      Frelsens Dag hjalp jeg dig." Se, nu er det en velbehagelig Tid,
      se, nu er det en Frelsens Dag;)
  3.  og vi give ikke i nogen Ting noget Anstød, for at Tjenesten ikke
      skal blive lastet;
  4.  men i alting anbefale vi som Guds Tjenere os selv ved stor
      Udholdenhed i Trængsler, i Nød, i Angster,
  5.  under Slag, i Fængsler, under Oprør, under Besværligheder, i
      Nattevågen, i Faste,
  6.  ved Renhed, ved Kundskab, ved Langmodighed, ved Velvillighed,
      ved den Helligånd, ved uskrømtet Kærlighed,
  7.  ved Sandheds Ord, ved Guds Kraft, ved Retfærdighedens Våben både
      til Angreb og Forsvar;
  8.  ved Ære og Vanære, ved ondt Rygte og godt Rygte; som Forførere
      og dog sanddru;
  9.  som ukendte og dog velkendte; som døende, og se, vi leve; som
      de, der tugtes, dog ikke til Døde;
 10.  som bedrøvede, dog altid glade; som fattige, der dog gøre mange
      rige; som de, der intet have, og dog eje alt.
 11.  Vor Mund er opladt over for eder, Korinthiere! vort Hjerte er
      udvidet.
 12.  I have ikke snæver Plads i os, men der er snæver Plads i eders
      Hjerter.
 13.  Men ligeså til Gengæld (jeg taler som til mine Børn), må også I
      udvide eders Hjerter!

 14.  Drager ikke i ulige Åg med vantro; thi hvad Fællesskab har
      Retfærdighed og Lovløshed? eller hvad Samfund har Lys med Mørke?
 15.  Hvad Samklang er der mellem Kristus og Belial? eller hvad
      Delagtighed har en troende med en vantro?
 16.  Hvad Samstemning har Guds Tempel med Afguder? Thi vi ere den
      levende Guds Tempel, ligesom Gud har sagt: "Jeg vil bo og vandre
      iblandt dem, og jeg vil være deres Gud, og de skulle være mit
      Folk."
 17.  "Derfor går ud fra dem og udskiller eder fra dem, siger Herren,
      og rører ikke noget urent; og jeg vil antage mig eder,"
 18.  "og jeg vil være eders Fader, og I skulle være mine Sønner og
      Døtre, siger Herren, den Almægtige."  (Kap. 7.) 1 Derfor,
      efterdi vi have disse Forjættelser, I elskede! så lader os rense
      os selv fra al Kødets og Åndens Besmittelse, så vi gennemføre
      Hellighed i Guds Frygt!

2.Korinterne 7
  2.  Giver os Rum; ingen have vi gjort Uret, ingen ødelagt, ingen
      bedraget.
  3.  Jeg siger det ikke for at fælde Dom; jeg har jo sagt tilforn, at
      I ere i vore Hjerter, så at vi dø sammen og leve sammen.
  4.  Jeg har stor Frimodighed over for eder; jeg roser mig meget af
      eder, jeg er fuld af Trøst, jeg strømmer over af Glæde under al
      vor Trængsel.
  5.  Thi også da vi kom til Makedonien, havde vort Kød ingen Ro, men
      vi trængtes på alle Måder: udadtil Kampe, indadtil Angster.
  6.  Men han, som trøster de nedbøjede, Gud, han trøstede os ved
      Titus's Komme;
  7.  dog ikke alene ved hans Komme, men også ved den Trøst, hvormed
      han var bleven trøstet over eder, idet han fortalte os om eders
      Længsel, eders Gråd, eders Nidkærhed for mig, så at jeg glædede
      mig end mere.

  8.  Thi om jeg end har bedrøvet eder ved Brevet, fortryder jeg det
      ikke.  Om jeg også har fortrudt det, - jeg ser jo, at hint Brev,
      ihvorvel kun til en Tid, har bedrøvet eder, -
  9.  så glæder jeg mig nu, ikke over, at I bleve bedrøvede, men over,
      at I bleve bedrøvede til Omvendelse; thi I bleve bedrøvede efter
      Guds Sind, for at I ikke i nogen Måde skulde lide Skade af os.
 10.  Thi den Bedrøvelse, der er efter Guds Sind, virker Omvendelse
      til Frelse, som ikke fortrydes; men Verdens Bedrøvelse virker
      Død.
 11.  Thi se, just dette, at I bleve bedrøvede efter Guds Sind, hvor
      stor en Iver virkede det ikke hos eder, ja Forsvar, ja Harme, ja
      Frygt, ja Længsel, ja Nidkærhed, ja Straf! På enhver Måde
      beviste I, at I selv vare rene i den Sag.
 12.  Altså, når jeg skrev til eder, var det ikke for hans Skyld, som
      gjorde Uret, ikke heller for hans Skyld, som led Uret, men for
      at eders Iver for os skulde blive åbenbar hos eder for Guds
      Åsyn.

 13.  Derfor ere vi blevne trøstede. Men til vor Trøst kom end
      yderligere Glæden over Titus's Glæde, fordi hans Ånd har fået
      Vederkvægelse fra eder alle.
 14.  Thi i hvad jeg end har rost mig af eder for ham, er jeg ikke
      bleven til Skamme; men ligesom vi i alle Ting have talt Sandhed
      til eder, således er også vor Ros for Titus bleven Sandhed.
 15.  Og hans Hjerte drages inderligere til eder, når han mindes
      Lydigheden hos eder alle,hvorledes I modtoge ham med Frygt og
      Bæven.
 16.  Jeg glæder mig over, at jeg i alt kan lide på eder.

2.Korinterne 8

  1.  Men vi kundgøre eder, Brødre! den Guds Nåde, som er given i
      Makedoniens Menigheder,
  2.  at under megen Trængsels Prøvelse har deres overstrømmende Glæde
      og deres dybe Fattigdom strømmet over i deres Gavmildheds
      Rigdom.
  3.  Thi efter Evne (det vidner jeg) gave de, ja, over Evne af egen
      Drift,
  4.  idet de med megen Overtalelse bade os om den Nåde at måtte tage
      Del i Hjælpen til de hellige,
  5.  og ikke alene som vi havde håbet, men sig selv gav de først og
      fremmest til Herren og så til os, ved Guds Villie,
  6.  så at vi opfordrede Titus til, ligesom han forhen havde begyndt,
      således også til at tilendebringe hos eder også denne Gave.
  7.  Men ligesom I ere rige i alt, i Tro og Tale og Erkendelse og al
      Iver og i eders Kærlighed til os: måtte I da være rige også i
      denne Gave!
  8.  Jeg siger det ikke som en Befaling, men for ved andres Iver at
      prøve også eders Kærligheds Ægthed.
  9.  I kende jo vor Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde, at han for eders Skyld
      blev fattig, da han var rig, for at I ved hans Fattigdom skulde
      blive rige.
 10.  Og jeg giver min Mening herom til Kende; thi dette er eder
      gavnligt, I, som jo i Fjor vare de første til at begynde, ikke
      alene med Gerningen, men endogså med Villien dertil.
 11.  Men fuldbringer da nu også Gerningen, for at, ligesom I vare
      redebonne til at ville, I også må fuldbringe det efter eders
      Evne.
 12.  Thi når Redebonheden er til Stede, da er den velbehagelig efter,
      hvad den evner, ikke efter, hvad den ikke evner.
 13.  Det er nemlig ikke Meningen, at andre skulle have Lettelse og I
      Trængsel; nej, det skal være ligeligt. Nu for Tiden må eders
      Overflod komme hines Trang til Hjælp,
 14.  for at også hines Overflod kan komme eders Trang til Hjælp, for
      at der kan blive Ligelighed,
 15.  som der er skrevet: "Den, som sankede meget, fik ikke for meget,
      og den, som sankede lidet, fik ikke for lidt."

 16.  Men Gud ske Tak, som giver den samme Iver for eder i Titus's
      Hjerte!
 17.  Thi vel har han modtaget min Opfordring; men da han er så ivrig,
      så er det af egen Drift, at han rejser til eder.
 18.  Og sammen med ham sende vi den Broder, hvis Ros i Evangeliet går
      igennem alle Menighederne,
 19.  og ikke det alene, men han er også udvalgt af Menighederne til
      at rejse med os med denne Gave, som besørges af os, for at
      fremme selve Herrens Ære og vor Redebonhed,
 20.  idet vi undgå dette, at nogen skulde kunne laste os i Anledning
      af denne rige Hjælp, som besørges af os;
 21.  thi vi lægge Vind på, hvad der er godt ikke alene i Herrens, men
      også i Menneskers Øjne.
 22.  Men sammen med dem sende vi vor Broder, hvis Iver vi ofte i
      mange Måder have prøvet, men som nu er langt ivrigere på Grund
      af sin støre Tillid til eder.
 23.  Hvad Titus angår, da er han min Fælle og Medarbejder hos eder,
      og hvad vore Brødre angår, da ere de Menighedsudsendinge, Kristi
      Ære.
 24.  Så giver dem da for Menighedernes Åsyn Beviset på eders
      Kærlighed og for det, vi have rost eder for.

2.Korinterne 9

  1.  Thi om Hjælpen til de hellige er det overflødigt at skrive til
      eder;
  2.  jeg kend eders Redebonhed, for hvilken jeg roser mig af eder hos
      Makedonierne, at nemlig Akaja alt fra i Fjor har været beredt;
      og eders Nidkærhed æggede de fleste.
  3.  Men jeg sender Brødrene, for at vor Ros over eder i dette Stykke
      ikke skal vise sig tom, og for at I.som jeg sagde, må være
      beredte.
  4.  for at ikke, når der kommer Makedoniere med mig, og de finder
      eder uforberedte, vi (for ej at sige I) da skulle blive til
      Skamme med denne Tillidsfuldhed.
  5.  Derfor har jeg anset det for nødvendigt at opfordre Brødrene til
      at gå i Forvejen til eder og forud bringe eders tidligere lovede
      Velsignelse i Stand, for at den kan være rede som Velsignelse og
      ikke som Karrighed.
  6.  Men dette siger jeg: Den, som sår sparsomt, skal også høste
      sparsomt, og den, som sår med Velsignelser, skal også høste med
      Velsignelser.
  7.  Enhver give, efter som han har sat sig for i sit Hjerte, ikke
      fortrædeligt eller af Tvang; thi Gud elsker en glad Giver.
  8.  Men Gud er mægtig til at lade al Nåde rigeligt tilflyde eder,
      for at I i alting altid kunne have til fuld Tilfredshed og have
      rigeligt til al god Gerning,
  9.  som der er skrevet: "Han spredte ud, han gav de fattige, hans
      Retfærdighed bliver til evig Tid."
 10.  Men han, som giver "Sædemanden Sæd og Brød til at spise," han
      vil også skænke og mangfoldiggøre eders Udsæd og give eders
      Retfærdigheds Frugter Vækst,
 11.  så I blive rige i alle Måder til al Gavmildhed, hvilken igennem
      os virker Taksigelse til Gud.
 12.  Thi denne Offertjenestes Ydelse ikke alene afhjælper de helliges
      Trang, men giver også et Overskud ved manges Taksigelser til
      Gud,
 13.  når de ved det prøvede Sind, som denne Ydelse viser, bringes til
      at prise Gud for Lydigheden i eders Bekendelse til Kristi
      Evangelium og for Oprigtigheden i eders Samfund med dem og med
      alle,
 14.  også ved deres Bøn for eder, idet de længes efter eder på Grund
      af Guds overvættes Nåde imod eder.
 15.  Gud ske Tak for hans uudsigelige Gave!

2.Korinterne 10

  1.  Men jeg selv, Paulus, formaner eder ved Kristi Sagtmodighed og
      Mildhed, jeg, som, "når I se derpå, er ydmyg iblandt eder, men
      fraværende er modig over for eder",
  2.  ja, jeg beder eder om ikke nærværende at skulle være modig med
      den Tillidsfuldhed, hvormed jeg agter at træde dristigt op imod
      nogle, som anse os for at vandre efter Kødet.
  3.  Thi om vi end vandre i Kødet, så stride vi dog ikke efter Kødet;
  4.  thi vore Stridsvåben er ikke kødelige, men mægtige for Gud til
      Fæstningers Nedbrydelse,
  5.  idet vi nedbryde Tankebygninger og al Højhed, som rejser sig
      imod Erkendelsen af Gud, og tage enhver Tanke til Fange til
      Lydighed imod Kristus
  6.  og ere rede til at straffe al Ulydighed, når eders Lydighed er
      bleven fuldkommen.
  7.  Se I på det udvortes? Dersom nogen trøster sig til selv at høre
      Kristus til, da slutte han igen fra sig selv, at ligesom han
      hører Kristus til, således gøre vi det også.
  8.  Ja, dersom jeg endog vilde rose mig noget mere af vor Magt, som
      Herren gav os til eders Opbyggelse og ikke til eders
      Nedbrydelse, skal jeg dog ikke blive til Skamme,
  9.  for at jeg ikke skal synes at ville skræmme eder ved mine Breve;
 10.  thi Brevene, siger man, ere vægtige og stærke, men hans
      legemlige Nærværelse er svag, og hans Tale intet værd.
 11.  En sådan betænke, at således som vi fraværende ere med Ord ved
      Breve, således ville vi, også nærværende være i Gerning.

 12.  Thi vi driste os ikke til at regne os iblandt eller sammenligne
      os med somme af dem, der anbefale sig selv; men selv indse de
      ikke, at de måle sig med sig selv og sammenligne sig med sig
      selv.
 13.  Vi derimod ville ikke rose os ud i det umålelige, men efter
      Målet af den Grænselinie, som Gud har tildelt os som Mål, at nå
      også til eder.
 14.  Thi vi strække os ikke for vidt, som om vi ikke nåede til eder;
      vi ere jo komne også indtil eder i Kristi Evangelium,
 15.  så vi ikke rose os ud i det umålelige af andres Arbejder, men
      have det Håb, at, når eders Tro vokser, ville vi hos eder blive
      store, efter vor Grænselinie, så vi kunne komme langt videre
 16.  og forkynde Evangeliet i Landene hinsides eder, men ikke rose os
      inden for en andens Grænselinie af det allerede fuldførte.
 17.  Men den, som roser sig, rose sig af Herren!
 18.  Thi ikke den, der anbefaler sig selv, står Prøve, men den, hvem
      Herren anbefaler.

2.Korinterne 11

  1.  Gid I vilde finde eder i en Smule Dårskab af mig! Dog, I gør det
      Jo nok.
  2.  Thi jeg er nidkær for eder med Guds Nidkærhed; jeg har jo
      trolovet eder med een Mand for at fremstille en ren Jomfru for
      Kristus.
  3.  Men jeg frygter for, at ligesom Slangen bedrog Eva ved sin
      Træskhed, således skulle eders Tanker fordærves og miste det
      oprigtige Sindelag over for Kristus.
  4.  Thi dersom nogen kommer og prædiker en anden Jesus, som vi ikke
      prædikede, eller I få en anderledes Ånd, som I ikke fik, eller
      et anderledes Evangelium, som I ikke modtoge, da vilde I kønt
      finde eder deri.
  5.  Thi jeg mener ikke at stå tilbage i noget for de såre store
      Apostle.
  6.  Er jeg end ulærd i Tale, så er jeg det dog ikke i Kundskab;
      tværtimod på enhver Måde have vi lagt den for Dagen for eder i
      alle Stykker.

  7.  Eller gjorde jeg Synd i at fornedre mig selv, for at I skulde
      ophøjes, idet jeg forkyndte eder Guds Evangelium for intet?
  8.  Andre Menigheder plyndrede jeg, idet jeg tog Sold af dem for at
      tjene eder, og medens jeg var nærværende hos eder og kom i
      Trang, faldt jeg ingen til Byrde;
  9.  thi min Trang afhjalp Brødrene, da de kom fra Makedonien, og i
      alt har jeg holdt og vil jeg holde mig uden Tynge for eder.
 10.  Så vist som Kristi Sandhed er i mig, skal denne Ros ikke
      fratages mig i Akajas Egne.
 11.  Hvorfor? mon fordi jeg ikke elsker eder? Gud ved det.
 12.  Men hvad jeg gør, det vil jeg fremdeles gøre, for at jeg kan
      afskære dem Lejligheden, som søge en Lejlighed, til at findes os
      lige i det, hvoraf de rose sig.
 13.  Thi sådanne ere falske Apostle, svigefulde Arbejdere, som påtage
      sig Skikkelse af Kristi Apostle.
 14.  Og det er intet Under; thi Satan selv påtager sig Skikkelse af
      en Lysets Engel.
 15.  Derfor er det ikke noget stort, om også hans Tjenere påtage sig
      Skikkelse som Retfærdigheds Tjenere; men deres Ende skal være
      efter deres Gerninger.

 16.  Atter siger jeg: Ingen må agte mig for en Dåre; men hvis så skal
      være, så tåler mig endog som en Dåre, for at også jeg kan rose
      mig en Smule.
 17.  Hvad jeg nu taler, taler jeg ikke efter Herrens Sind, men som i
      Dårskab, idet jeg så tillidsfuldt roser mig.
 18.  Efterdi mange rose sig med Hensyn til Kødet, vil også jeg rose
      mig.
 19.  Gerne finde I eder jo i Dårerne, efterdi I ere kloge.
 20.  I finde eder jo i, om nogen gør eder til Trælle, om nogen æder
      eder op, om nogen tager til sig, om nogen ophøjer sig, om nogen
      slår eder i Ansigtet.
 21.  Med Skamfuldhed siger jeg det, efterdi vi have været svage; men
      hvad end nogen trodser på (jeg taler i Dårskab), derpå trodser
      også jeg.
 22.  Ere de Hebræere? Jeg også. Ere de Israeliter? Jeg også. Ere de
      Abrahams Sæd? Jeg også.
 23.  Ere de Kristi Tjenere? Jeg taler i Vanvid: jeg er det mere. Jeg
      har lidt langt flere Besværligheder, fået langt flere Slag,
      været hyppigt i Fængsel, ofte i Dødsfare.
 24.  Af Jøder har jeg fem Gange fået fyrretyve Slag mindre end eet.
 25.  Tre Gange er jeg bleven pisket, een Gang stenet, tre Gange har
      jeg lidt Skibbrud, et Døgn har jeg tilbragt på Dybet;
 26.  ofte på Rejser, i Farer fra Floder, i Farer iblandt Røvere, i
      Farer fra mit Folk, i Farer fra Hedninger, i Farer i By, i Farer
      i Ørken, i Farer på Havet, i Farer iblandt falske Brødre;
 27.  i Møje og Anstrengelse, ofte i Nattevågen, i Hunger og Tørst,
      ofte i Faste, i Kulde og Nøgenhed;
 28.  foruden hvad der kommer til, mit daglige Overløb, Bekymringen
      for alle Menighederne.
 29.  Hvem er skrøbelig, uden at også jeg er det? hvem bliver
      forarget, uden at det brænder i mig?
 30.  Dersom jeg skal rose mig, da vil jeg rose mig af min
      Magtesløshed.
 31.  Gud og den Herres Jesu Fader, som er højlovet i Evighed, ved, at
      jeg ikke lyver.
 32.  I Damaskus holdt Kong Aretas's Statholder Damaskenernes Stad
      bevogtet for at gribe mig;
 33.  men jeg blev igennem en Luge firet ned over Muren i en Kurv og
      undflyede af hans Hænder.

2.Korinterne 12

  1.  Rose mig må jeg Gavnligt er det vel ikke; men jeg vil komme til
      Syner og Åbenbarelser fra Herren.
  2.  Jeg kender et Menneske i Kristus, som for fjorten År siden om
      han var i Legemet, det ved jeg ikke, eller uden for Legemet, det
      ved jeg ikke, Gud ved det blev bortrykket indtil den tredje
      Himmel.
  3.  Og jeg ved, at dette Menneske (om han var i Legemet, eller uden
      Legemet, det ved jeg ikke, Gud ved det),
  4.  at han blev bortrykket ind i Paradiset, og hørte uudsigelige
      Ord, som det ikke er et Menneske tilladt at udtale.
  5.  Af en sådan vil jeg rose mig; men af mig selv vil jeg ikke rose
      mig, uden af min Magtesløshed.
  6.  Thi vel bliver jeg ikke en Dåre, om jeg vilde rose mig; thi det
      vil være Sandhed, jeg siger; men jeg afholder mig derfra, for at
      ingen skal tænke højere om mig, end hvad han ser mig være, eller
      hvad han hører af mig.
  7.  Og for at jeg ikke skal hovmode mig af de høje Åbenbarelser,
      blev der givet mig en Torn i Kødet, en Satans Engel, for at han
      skulde slå mig i Ansigtet, for at jeg ikke skulde hovmode mig.
  8.  Om denne bad jeg Herren tre Gange, at han måtte vige fra mig;
  9.  og han har sagt mig: "Min Nåde er dig nok; thi Kraften
      fuldkommes i Magtesløshed." Allerhelst vil jeg derfor rose mig
      af min Magtesløshed, for at Kristi Kraft kan tage Bolig i mig.
 10.  Derfor er jeg veltilfreds under Magtesløshed, under Overlast,
      under Nød, under Forfølgelser, under Angster for Kristi Skyld;
      thi når jeg er magtesløs, da er jeg stærk.

 11.  Jeg er bleven en Dåre. I tvang mig dertil. Jeg burde jo
      anbefales af eder; thi jeg har ikke stået tilbage i noget for de
      såre store Apostle, om jeg end, intet er.
 12.  En Apostels Tegn bleve jo udførte, iblandt eder under
      Udholdenhed, ved Tegn og Undere og kraftige Gerninger.
 13.  Thi hvad er det vel, hvori I bleve stillede ringere end de andre
      Menigheder; uden at jeg ikke selv faldt eder til Byrde? Tilgiver
      mig denne Uret!
 14.  Se, dette er nu tredje Gang, jeg står rede til at komme til
      eder, og jeg vil ikke falde til Byrde; thi jeg søger ikke eders
      Gods, men eder selv, thi Børnene skulle ikke samle sammen til
      Forældrene, men Forældrene til Børnene.
 15.  Men jeg vil med Glæde gøre Opofrelser ja, opofres for eders
      Sjæle.  Mon jeg, når jeg elsker eder højere, elskes mindre?
 16.  Men lad så være, at jeg ikke har været eder til Byrde, men jeg
      var træsk og fangede eder med List!
 17.  Har jeg da gjort mig Fordel af eder ved nogen af dem, jeg har
      sendt til eder?
 18.  Jeg opfordrede Titus og sendte Broderen med; har Titus da gjort
      sig nogen Fordel af eder? Vandrede vi ikke i den samme Ånd, i de
      samme Fodspor?

 19.  Alt længe have I ment, at vi forsvare os for eder. Nej, for Guds
      Åsyn tale vi i Kristus. Men det sker alt sammen, I elskede, for
      eders Opbyggelses Skyld.
 20.  Thi jeg frygter for, at, når jeg kommer, jeg da måske ikke skal
      finde eder sådanne, som jeg ønsker, og at jeg skal findes af
      eder sådan, som I ikke ønske; at der skal være Kiv, Nid,
      Hidsighed, Rænker, Bagtalelser, Øretuderier, Opblæsthed,
      Klammerier,
 21.  at min Gud, når jeg kommer igen, skal ydmyge mig i Anledning af
      eder, og jeg skal sørge over mange af dem, som forhen have
      syndet og ikke have omvendt sig fra den Urenhed og Utugt og
      Uterlighed, som de bedreve.

2.Korinterne 13

  1.  Det er nu tredje Gang, jeg kommer til eder. På to og tre Vidners
      Mund skal enhver Sag stå fast.
  2.  Jeg har sagt det forud og siger det forud, ligesom da jeg anden
      Gang var nærværende, således også nu fraværende til dem, som
      forhen have syndet, og til alle de øvrige, at, om jeg kommer
      igen, vil jeg ikke skåne,
  3.  efterdi I fordre Bevis på, at Kristus taler i mig, han, som ikke
      er magtesløs over for eder, men er stærk iblandt eder.
  4.  Thi vel blev han korsfæstet i Magtesløshed, men han lever ved
      Guds Kraft; også vi ere svage i ham, men vi skulle leve med ham
      ved Guds Kraft over for eder.
  5.  Ransager eder selv, om I ere i Troen; prøver eder selv! Eller
      erkende I ikke om eder selv, at Jesus Kristus er i eder? ellers
      ere I udygtige.
  6.  Men jeg håber, at I skulle kende, at vi ere ikke udygtige.
  7.  Men vi bede til Gud om, at I intet ondt må gøre; ikke for at vi
      må vise os dygtige, men for at I må gøre det gode, vi derimod
      stå som udygtige.
  8.  Thi vi formå ikke noget imod Sandheden, men for Sandheden.
  9.  Thi vi glæde os, når vi ere magtesløse, og I ere stærke; dette
      ønske vi også, at I må blive fuldkommengjorte.
 10.  Derfor skriver jeg dette fraværende, for at jeg ikke nærværende
      skal bruge Strenghed, efter den Magt, som Herren har givet mig
      til Opbyggelse, og ikke til Nedbrydelse.

 11.  I øvrigt, Brødre! glæder eder, bliver fuldkommengjorte, lader
      eder formane, værer enige, værer fredsommelige; og Kærlighedens
      og Fredens Gud skal være med eder.
 12.  Hilser hverandre med et helligt Kys! Alle de hellige hilse eder.
 13.  Den Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde og Guds Kærlighed og den Helligånds
      Samfund være med eder alle!


Galaterne

Galaterne 1

  1.  Paulus, Apostel, ikke af Mennesker, ikke heller ved noget
      Menneske, men ved Jesus Kristus og Gud Fader, som oprejste ham
      fra de døde,
  2.  og alle Brødrene, som ere med mig, til Menighederne i Galatien:
  3.  Nåde være med eder og Fred fra Gud Fader og vor Herre Jesus
      Kristus,
  4.  som gav sig selv for vore Synder, for at han kunde udfri os af
      den nærværende onde Verden, efter vor Guds og Faders Villie,
  5.  ham være Æren i Evigheders Evighed! Amen.

  6.  Jeg undrer mig over, at I så snart lade eder føre bort fra ham,
      som kaldte eder til Kristi Nåde, hen til et anderledes
      Evangelium;
  7.  hvilket dog ikke er et andet, men det er kun nogle, som forvirre
      eder. og ville vende op og ned på Kristi Evangelium.
  8.  Men selv om vi eller en Engel fra Himmelen forkynder eder
      Evangeliet anderledes; end vi have forkyndt eder det, han være
      en Forbandelse!
  9.  Som vi før have sagt, så siger jeg nu igen: Dersom nogen
      forkynder eder Evangeliet anderledes, end I have modtaget det,
      han være en Forbandelse!
 10.  Taler jeg da nu Mennesker til Villie, eller Gud? eller søger jeg
      at behage Mennesker? Dersom jeg endnu vilde behage Mennesker, da
      var jeg ikke en Kristi Tjener.

 11.  Men jeg kundgør eder, Brødre! at det Evangelium, som er forkyndt
      af mig, er ikke Menneskeværk;
 12.  thi heller ikke jeg har modtaget det eller er bleven undervist
      derom af noget Menneske, men ved Åbenbarelse at Jesus Kristus.
 13.  I have jo hørt om min Vandel forhen i Jødedommen, at jeg over al
      Måde forfulgte Guds Menighed og søgte at udrydde den.
 14.  Og jeg gik videre i Jødedommen end mange jævnaldrende i mit
      Folk, idet jeg var langt mere nidkær for mine fædrene
      Overleveringer.
 15.  Men da det behagede Gud, som fra min Moders Liv havde udtaget
      mig og havde kaldet mig ved sin Nåde,
 16.  at åbenbare sin Søn i mig, for at jeg skulde forkynde Evangeliet
      om ham iblandt Hedningerne: da spurgte jeg straks ikke Kød og
      Blod til Råds,
 17.  drog heller ikke op til Jerusalem, til dem, som før mig vare
      Apostle, men jeg drog bort til Arabien og vendte atter tilbage
      til Damaskus.
 18.  Senere, tre År efter, drog jeg op til Jerusalem for at blive
      kendt med Kefas og blev hos ham i femten Dage.
 19.  Men nogen anden af Apostlene så jeg ikke, men kun Jakob, Herrens
      Broder.
 20.  Men hvad jeg skriver til eder - se, for Guds Åsyn vidner jeg, at
      jeg ikke lyver.
 21.  Derefter kom jeg til Syriens og Kilikiens Egne.
 22.  Men personlig var jeg ukendt for Judæas Menigheder i Kristus;
 23.  de hørte kun sige: Han, som forhen forfulgte os, forkynder nu
      Evangeliet om den Tro, som han forhen vilde udrydde;
 24.  og de priste Gud for mig.

Galaterne 2

  1.  Senere, efter fjorten Års Forløb, drog jeg atter op til
      Jerusalem med Brnabas og tog også Titus med.
  2.  Men jeg drog op ifølge en Åbenbaring og forelagde dem, men
      særskilt de ansete, det Evangelium, som jeg prædiker iblandt
      Hedningerne, - om jeg vel løber eller har løbet forgæves.
  3.  Men end ikke min Ledsager, Titus, som var en Græker, blev
      tvungen til at omskæres,
  4.  nemlig for de indsnegne falske Brødres Skyld, som jo havde
      listet sig ind for at lure på vor Frihed, som vi have i Kristus
      Jesus, for at de kunde gøre os til Trælle.
  5.  For dem vege vi end ikke et Øjeblik i Eftergivenhed, for at
      Evangeliets Sandhed måtte blive varig hos eder.
  6.  Men fra deres Side, som ansås for at være noget, (hvordan de
      fordum vare, er mig uden Forskel; Gud ser ikke på et Menneskes
      Person;) - over for mig nemlig havde de ansete intet at tilføje.
  7.  Men tværtimod, da de så, at jeg har fået Evangeliet til de
      uomskårne betroet, ligesom Peter til de omskårne,
  8.  (thi han, som gav Peter Kraft til Apostelgerning for de
      omskårne, gav også mig Kaft dertil for Hedningerne;)
  9.  og da de lærte den mig givne Nåde at kende, gave Jakob og Kefas
      og Johannes, som ansås for at være Søjler, mig og Barnabas
      Samfundshånd for at vi skulde gå til Hedningerne og de til de
      omskårne;
 10.  kun at vi skulde komme de fattige i Hu, hvad jeg også just har
      bestræbt mig for at gøre.

 11.  Men da Kefas kom til Antiokia, trådte jeg op imod ham for hans
      åbne Øjne, thi domfældt var han.
 12.  Thi førend der kom nogle fra Jakob, spiste han sammen med
      Hedningerne; men da de kom, trak han sig tilbage og skilte sig
      fra dem af Frygt for dem af Omskærelsen.
 13.  Og med ham hyklede også de øvrige Jøder, så at endog Barnabas
      blev dragen med af deres Hykleri.
 14.  Men da jeg så, at de ikke vandrede rettelig efter Evangeliets
      Sandhed, sagde jeg til Kefas i alles Påhør: Når du, som er en
      Jøde, lever på hedensk og ikke på jødisk Vis, hvor kan du da
      tvinge Hedningerne til at opføre sig som Jøder?
 15.  Vi ere af Natur Jøder og ikke Syndere af hedensk Byrd;
 16.  men da vi vide, at et Menneske ikke bliver retfærdiggjort af
      Lovens Gerninger, men kun ved Tro på Jesus Kristus, så have også
      vi troet på Kristus Jesus, for at vi måtte blive retfærdiggjorte
      al Tro på Kristus og ikke af Lovens Gerninger; thi af Lovens
      Geringer skal intet Kød blive retfærdiggjort.
 17.  Men når vi, idet vi søgte at blive retfærdiggjorte i Kristus,
      også selv fandtes at være Syndere, så er jo Kristus en Tjener
      for Synd? Det være langtfra!
 18.  når jeg nemlig igen bygger det op, som jeg nedbrød, da viser jeg
      mig selv som Overtræder.
 19.  Thi jeg er ved Loven død fra Loven, for at jeg skal leve for
      Gud.
 20.  Med Kristus er jeg korsfæstet, og det er ikke mere mig, der
      lever, men Kristus lever i mig; men hvad jeg nu lever, i Kødet,
      det lever jeg i Troen, på Guds Søn, som elskede mig og gav sig
      selv hen for mig.
 21.  Jeg ophæver ikke Guds Nåde; thi er der Retfærdighed ved Loven,
      da er jo Kristus død forgæves.

Galaterne 3

  1.  O, I uforstandige Galatere! hvem har fortryllet eder, I, hvem
      Jesus Kristus blev malet for Øje som korsfæstet?
  2.  Kun dette vil jeg vide af eder: Var det ved Lovens Gerninger, I
      modtoge Ånden, eller ved i Tro at høre?
  3.  Ere I så uforstandige? ville I, som begyndte i Ånd, nu ende i
      Kød?
  4.  Have I da prøvet så meget forgæves? hvis det da virkelig er
      forgæves!
  5.  Mon da han, som meddeler eder Ånden og virker kraftige Gerninger
      iblandt eder, gør dette ved Lovens Gerninger eller ved, at I
      høre i Tro?
  6.  ligesom jo "Abraham troede Gud, og det blev regnet ham til
      Retfærdighed".
  7.  Erkender altså, at de, som ere af Tro, disse ere Abrahams Børn.
  8.  Men da Skriften forudså, at det er af Tro, at Gud retfærdiggør
      Hedningerne, forkyndte den forud Abraham det Evangelium: "I dig
      skulle alle Folkeslagene velsignes",
  9.  så at de, som ere af Tro, velsignes sammen med den troende
      Abraham.

 10.  Thi så mange, som holde sig til Lovens Gerninger, ere under
      Forbandelse; thi der er skrevet: "Forbandet hver den, som ikke
      bliver i alle de Ting, som ere skrevne i Lovens Bog, så han gør
      dem."
 11.  Men at ingen bliver retfærdiggjort for Gud ved Lov, er åbenbart,
      thi "deri retfærdige skal leve af Tro."
 12.  Men Loven beror ikke på Tro; men: "Den, som gør disse Ting, skal
      leve ved dem."
 13.  Kristus har løskøbt os fra Lovens Forbandelse, idet han blev en
      Forbandelse for os (thi der er skrevet: "Forbandet er hver den,
      som hænger på et Træ"),
 14.  for at Abrahams Velsignelse måtte komme til Hedningerne i
      Kristus Jesus, for at vi kunde få Åndens Forjættelse ved Troen.

 15.  Brødre! jeg taler på Menneskevis: Ingen ophæver dog et Menneskes
      stadfæstede Arvepagt eller føjer noget dertil.
 16.  Men Abraham og hans Sæd bleve Forjættelserne tilsagte; der siges
      ikke: "og Sædene", som om mange, men som om eet: "og din Sæd",
      hvilken er Kristus.
 17.  Jeg mener dermed dette: En Pagt, som forud er stadfæstet af Gud,
      kan Loven, som blev til fire Hundrede og tredive År senere, ikke
      gøre ugyldig, så at den skulde gøre Forjættelsen til intet.
 18.  Thi fås Arven ved Lov, da fås den ikke mere ved Forjættelse; men
      til Abraham har Gud skænket den ved Forjættelse.

 19.  Hvad skulde da Loven? Den blev føjet til for Overtrædelsernes
      Skyld (indtil den Sæd kom, hvem Forjættelsen gjaldt), besørget
      ved Engle, ved en Mellemmands Hånd.
 20.  Men en Mellemmand er ikke kun for een Part; Gud derimod er een.
 21.  Er da Loven imod Guds Forjættelser? Det være langtfra! Ja, hvis
      der var givet en Lov, som kunde levendegøre, da var
      Retfærdigheden virkelig af Lov.
 22.  Men Skriften har indesluttet alt under Synd, for at Forjættelsen
      skulde af Tro på Jesus Kristus gives dem, som tro.
 23.  Men førend Troen kom, holdtes vi indelukkede under Lovens
      Bevogtning til den Tro, som skulde åbenbares,
 24.  så at Loven er bleven os en Tugtemester til Kristus, for at vi
      skulde blive retfærdiggjorte af Tro.
 25.  Men efter at Troen er kommen, ere vi ikke mere under
      Tugtemester.
 26.  Thi alle ere I Guds Børn ved Troen på Kristus Jesus.
 27.  Thi I, så mange som bleve døbte til Kristus, have iført eder
      Kristus.
 28.  Her er ikke Jøde eller Græker; her er ikke Træl eller fri; her
      er ikke Mand og Kvinde; thi alle ere I een i Kristus Jesus.
 29.  Men når I høre Kristus til, da ere I jo Abrahams Sæd, Arvinger
      ifølge Forjættelse.

Galaterne 4

  1.  Men jeg siger: Så længe Arvingen er umyndig, er der ingen
      Forskel imellem ham og en Træl, skønt han er Herre over alt
      Godset;
  2.  men han står under Formyndere og Husholdere indtil den af
      Faderen bestemte Tid.
  3.  Således stode også vi, dengang vi vare umyndige, som Trælle
      under Verdens Børnelærdom.
  4.  Men da Tidens Fylde kom, udsendte Gud sin Søn, født af en
      Kvinde, født under Loven,
  5.  for at han skulde løskøbe dem, som vare under Loven, for at vi
      skulde få Sønneudkårelsen.
  6.  Men fordi I ere Sønner, har Gud udsendt i vore Hjerter sin Søns
      Ånd, som råber: Abba, Fader!
  7.  Altså er du ikke længer Træl, men Søn; men er du Søn, da er du
      også Arving ved Gud.

  8.  Dengang derimod, da I ikke kendte Gud, trællede I for de Guder,
      som af Natur ikke ere det.
  9.  Men nu, da I have lært Gud at kende, ja, meget mere ere blevne
      kendte af Gud, hvor kunne I da atter vende tilbage til den svage
      og fattige Børnelærdom, som I atter forfra ville trælle under?
 10.  I tage Vare på Dage og Måneder og Tider og År.
 11.  Jeg frygter for, at jeg måske har arbejdet forgæves på eder.

 12.  Vorder ligesom jeg, thi også jeg er bleven som I, Brødre! jeg
      beder eder. I have ikke gjort mig nogen Uret.
 13.  Men I vide, at det var på Grund af en Kødets Svaghed, at jeg
      første Gang forkyndte Evangeliet for eder;
 14.  og det, som i mit Kød var eder til Fristelse, ringeagtede I ikke
      og afskyede I ikke, men I modtoge mig som en Guds Engel, som
      Kristus Jesus.
 15.  Hvor er da nu eders Saligprisning? Thi jeg giver eder det
      Vidnesbyrd, at, om det havde været muligt, havde I udrevet eders
      Øjne og givet mig dem.
 16.  Så er jeg vel bleven eders Fjende ved at tale Sandhed til eder?
 17.  De ere nidkære for eder, dog ikke for det gode; men de ville
      udelukke eder, for at I skulle være nidkære for dem.
 18.  Men det er godt at vise sig nidkær i det gode til enhver Tid, og
      ikke alene, når jeg er nærværende hos eder.
 19.  Mine Børn, som jeg atter føder med Smerte, indtil Kristus har
      vundet Skikkelse i eder!
 20.  - ja, jeg vilde ønske, at jeg nu var til Stede hos eder og kunde
      omskifte min Røst; thi jeg er rådvild over for eder.

 21.  Siger mig, I, som ville være under Loven, høre I ikke Loven?
 22.  Der er jo skrevet, at Abraham havde to Sønner, en med
      Tjenestekvinden og en med den frie Kvinde.
 23.  Men Tjenestekvindens Søn er avlet efter Kødet, den frie Kvindes
      ved Forjættelsen.
 24.  Dette har en billedlig Betydning. Thi disse Kvinder ere tvende
      Pagter, den ene fra Sinai Bjerg, som føder til Trældom: denne er
      Hagar.
 25.  Thi "Hagar" er Sinai Bjerg i Arabien, men svarer til det
      nuværende Jerusalem; thi det er i Trældom med sine Børn.
 26.  Men Jerusalem heroventil er frit, og hun er vor Moder.
 27.  Thi der er skrevet: "Fryd dig, du ufrugtbare, du, som ikke
      føder!  bryd ud og råb, du, som ikke har Fødselsveer! thi mange
      ere den enliges Børn fremfor hendes, som har Manden."
 28.  Men vi, Brødre! ere Forjættelsens Børn i Lighed med Isak.
 29.  Men ligesom dengang han, som var avlet efter Kødet, forfulgte
      ham, som var avlet efter Ånden, således også nu.
 30.  Men hvad siger Skriften?"Uddriv Tjenestekvinden og hendes Søn;
      thi Tjenestekvindens Søn skal ingenlunde arve med den frie
      Kvindes Søn."
 31.  Derfor, Brødre! ere vi ikke Tjenestekvindens Børn, men den frie
      Kvindes.

Galaterne 5

  1.  Til Friheden har Kristus frigjort os. Så står nu fast, og lader
      eder ikke atter holde under Trældoms Åg!
  2.  Se, jeg, Paulus, siger eder, at dersom I lade eder omskære, vil
      Kristus intet gavne eder.
  3.  Men jeg vidner atter for hvert Menneske, som lader sig omskære,
      at han er skyldig at opfylde hele Loven.
  4.  I ere tabte for Kristus, I, som retfærdiggøres ved Loven; I ere
      faldne ud af Nåden.
  5.  Vi vente jo ved Ånden af Tro Retfærdigheds Håb.
  6.  Thi i Kristus Jesus gælder hverken Omskærelse eller Forhud
      noget, men Tro, som er virksom ved Kærlighed.

  7.  I vare godt på Vej; hvem har hindret eder i at adlyde Sandhed?
  8.  Den Overtalelse kom ikke fra ham, som kaldte eder.
  9.  En liden Surdejg syrer hele Dejgen.
 10.  Jeg har den Tillid til eder i Herren, at I ikke ville mene noget
      andet; men den, som forvirrer eder, skal bære sin Dom, hvem han
      end er.
 11.  Men jeg, Brødre! dersom jeg endnu prædiker Omskærelse, hvor for
      forfølges jeg da endnu? Så er jo Korsets Forargelse gjort til
      intet.
 12.  Gid de endog måtte lemlæste sig selv, de, som forstyrre eder!

 13.  I bleve jo kaldede til Frihed, Brødre! kun at I ikke bruge
      Friheden til en Anledning for Kødet, men værer ved Kærligheden
      hverandres Tjenere!
 14.  Thi hele Loven er opfyldt i eet Ord, i det: "Du skal elske din
      Næste som dig selv."
 15.  Men når I bide og æde hverandre, da ser til, at I ikke fortæres
      af hverandre!

 16.  Men jeg siger: Vandrer efter Ånden, så fuldbyrde I ingenlunde
      Kødets Begæring.
 17.  Thi Kødet begærer imod Ånden, og Ånden imod Kødet; disse stå
      nemlig hinanden imod,for at I ikke skulle gøre, hvad I have Lyst
      til.
 18.  Men når I drives af Ånden, ere I ikke under Loven.
 19.  Men Kødets Gerninger ere åbenbare, såsom: Utugt, Urenhed,
      Uterlighed,
 20.  Afgudsdyrkelse,Trolddom,Fjendskaber, Kiv, Nid, Hidsighed,
      Rænker, Tvedragt, Partier,
 21.  Avind, Drukkenskab, Svir og deslige; hvorom jeg forud siger
      eder, ligesom jeg også før har sagt, at de, som øve sådanne
      Ting, skulle ikke arve Guds Rige.
 22.  Men Åndens Frugt er Kærlighed, Glæde, Fred, Langmodighed,
      Mildhed, Godhed, Trofasthed,
 23.  Sagtmodighed, Afholdenhed Imod sådanne er Loven ikke,
 24.  men de, som høre Kristus Jesus til, have korsfæstet Kødet med
      dets Lidenskaber og Begæringer.
 25.  Når vi leve ved Ånden, da lader os også vandre efter Ånden!
 26.  Lader os ikke have Lyst til tom Ære, så at vi udæske hverandre
      og bære Avind imod hverandre.

Galaterne 6

  1.  Brødre! om også et Menneske bliver overrasket af nogen
      Forsyndelse, da hjælper en sådan til Rette, I åndelige! med
      Sagtmodigheds Ånd, og se til dig selv, at ikke også du bliver
      fristet!
  2.  Bærer hverandres Byrder og opfylder således Kristi Lov!
  3.  Thi når nogen mener, at han er noget, skønt han intet er, da
      bedrager han sig selv.
  4.  Men hver prøve sin egen Gerning, og da skal han have sin Ros i
      Forhold til sig selv alene, og ikke til Næsten;
  5.  thi hver skal bære sin egen Byrde.

  6.  Men den, som undervises i Ordet skal dele alt godt med den, som
      underviser ham.
  7.  Farer ikke vild; Gud lader sig ikke spotte; thi hvad et Menneske
      sår, det skal han også høste.
  8.  Thi den, som sår i sit Kød, skal høste Fordærvelse af Kødet; men
      den, som sår i Ånden, skal høste evigt Liv af Ånden.
  9.  Men når vi gøre det gode, da lader os ikke blive trætte; thi i
      sin Tid skulle vi høste, såfremt vi ikke give tabt.
 10.  Så lader os altså, efter som vi have Lejlighed, gøre det gode
      imod alle, men mest imod Troens egne!

 11.  Ser nu, med hvor store Bogstaver jeg skriver til eder med min
      egen Hånd!
 12.  Alle de, som ville tage sig godt ud i Kødet, de tvinge eder til
      at lade eder omskære, alene for at de ikke skulle forfølges for
      Kristi Kors's Skyld.
 13.  Thi ikke engang de, som lade sig omskære, holde selv Loven; men
      de ville, at I skulle lade eder omskære, for at de kunne rose
      sig af eders Kød.
 14.  Men det være langt fra mig at rose mig uden af vor Herres Jesu
      Kristi Kors,ved hvem Verden er korsfæstet for mig, og jeg for
      Verden.
 15.  Thi hverken Omskærelse eller Forhud er noget, men en ny
      Skabning.
 16.  Og så mange, som vandre efter denne Rettesnor, over dem være
      Fred og Barmhjertighed, og over Guds Israel!

 17.  Herefter volde ingen mig Besvær; thi jeg bærer Jesu Mærketegn på
      mit Legeme:
 18.  Vor Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde være med eders Ånd, Brødre! Amen.


Efeserne

Efeserne 1

  1.  Paulus, Kristi Jesu Apostel ved Guds Villie, til de hellige, som
      ere i Efesus og ere troende i Kristus Jesus:
  2.  Nåde være med eder og Fred fra Gud vor Fader og den Herre Jesus
      Kristus!

  3.  Lovet være Gud og vor Herres Jesu Kristi Fader, som har
      velsignet os med al åndelig Velsignelse i det himmelske i
      Kristus,
  4.  ligesom han har udvalgt os i ham før Verdens Grundlæggelse til
      at være hellige og ulastelige for hans Åsyn,
  5.  idet han i Kærlighed forudbestemte os til Sønneudkårelse hos sig
      ved Jesus Kristus, efter sin Villies Velbehag,
  6.  til Pris for sin Nådes Herlighed, som han benådede os med i den
      elskede,
  7.  i hvem vi have Forløsningen ved hans Blod, Syndernes Forladelse,
      efter hans Nådes Rigdom,
  8.  som han rigelig tildelte os i al Visdom og Forstand,
  9.  idet han kundgjorde os sin Villies Hemmelighed, efter sin
      velbehagelige Beslutning, som han havde fattet hos sig selv,
 10.  for at oprette en Husholdning i Tidernes Fylde, nemlig at
      sammenfatte sig alt i Kristus, det, som er i Himlene, og det,
      som er på Jorden, i ham,
 11.  i hvem vi også have fået Arvelodden, forud bestemte efter hans
      Forsæt, der virker alt efter sin Villies Råd,
 12.  for at vi skulde være til Pris for hans Herlighed, vi, som forud
      havde håbet på Kristus,
 13.  i hvem også I, da I hørte Sandhedens Ord, Evangeliet om eders
      Frelse, i hvem I også, da I bleve troende, bleve beseglede med
      Forjættelsens hellige Ånd,
 14.  som er Pant på vor Arv, til Ejendommens Forløsning, til Pris for
      hans Herlighed.

 15.  derfor har også jeg, efter at have hørt om eders Tro på den
      Herre Jesus og om eders Kærlighed til alle de hellige,
 16.  ikke ophørt at takke for eder, idet jeg ihukommer eder i mine
      Bønner om,
 17.  at vor Herres Jesu Kristi Gud, Herlighedens Fader, må give eder
      Visdoms og Åbenbarelses Ånd i Erkendelse af ham,
 18.  gøre eders Hjertes Øjne oplyste til at kende, hvilket det Håb
      er, som han kaldte eder til, hvilken hans Arvs Herligheds Rigdom
      er iblandt de hellige,
 19.  og hvilken hans Krafts overvættes Storhed er over for os, som
      tro, alt efter hans Styrkes vældige Virkekraft,
 20.  som han udviste på Kristus, da han oprejste ham fra de døde og
      satte ham ved sin højre Hånd i det himmelske,
 21.  langt over al Magt og Myndighed og Kraft og Herredom og hvert
      Navn, som nævnes,ikke alene i denne Verden, men også i den
      kommende,
 22.  og lagde alt under hans Fødder, og ham gav han som Hoved over
      alting til Menigheden,
 23.  der er hans Legeme, fyldt af ham, som fylder alt i alle.

Efeserne 2

  1.  Også eder, da I vare døde ved eders Overtrædelser og Synder,
  2.  hvori I fordum vandrede efter denne Verdens Tidsånd, efter hans
      Vis, som hersker over Luftens Magt, over den Ånd, der nu er
      virksom i Genstridighedens Børn,
  3.  iblandt hvilke også vi fordum alle vandrede i vort Køds
      Begæringer og gjorde Kødets og Tankernes Villie og vare af Natur
      Vredes Børn ligesom også de andre,
  4.  men Gud, som er rig på Barmhjertighed, har for sin store
      Kærligheds Skyld, hvormed han elskede os,
  5.  også da vi vare døde ved vore Overtrædelser, levendegjort os med
      Kristus - af Nåde ere I frelste!
  6.  og medoprejst os og sat os med ham i det himmelske i Kristus
      Jesus,
  7.  for at han i de tilkommende Tider kunde vise sin Nådes
      overvættes Rigdom ved Godhed imod os i Kristus Jesus.
  8.  Thi af Nåden ere I frelste ved Tro, og det ikke af eder selv,
      Guds er Gaven;
  9.  ikke af Gerninger, for at ikke nogen skal rose sig.
 10.  Thi vi ere hans Værk, skabte i Kristus Jesus til gode Gerninger,
      som Gud forud beredte, for at vi skulde vandre i dem.

 11.  Derfor kommer i Hu, at fordum I Hedninger i Kødet, I, som bleve
      kaldte Forhud af den såkaldte Omskærelse, der sker i Kødet med
      Hånden,
 12.  at I på den Tid, uden for Kristus, vare udelukkede fra Israels
      Borgerret og fremmede for Forjættelsens Pagter, uden Håb og uden
      Gud i Verden.
 13.  Nu derimod, i Kristus Jesus, ere I, som fordum vare langt borte,
      komne nær til ved Kristi Blod.
 14.  Thi han er vor Fred, han, som gjorde begge til eet og nedbrød
      Gærdets Skillevæg,
 15.  Fjendskabet, da han i sit Kød afskaffede Budenes Lov med dens
      Befalinger, for at han i sig kunde skabe de to til eet nyt
      Menneske ved at stifte Fred
 16.  og for at forlige dem begge i eet Legeme med Gud ved Korset,
      idet han ved dette dræbte Fjendskabet.
 17.  Og han kom og forkyndte Fred for eder, som vare langt borte, og
      Fred for dem, som vare nær.
 18.  Thi ved ham have vi begge i een Ånd Adgang til Faderen.
 19.  Så ere I da ikke mere fremmede og Udlændinge, men I ere de
      helliges Medborgere og Guds Husfolk,
 20.  opbyggede på Apostlenes og Profeternes Grundvold, idet
      Hovedhjørnestenen er Kristus Jesus selv,
 21.  i hvem enhver Bygning sammenføjes og vokser til et helligt
      Tempel i Herren,
 22.  i hvem også I blive medopbyggede til en Guds Bolig i Ånden.

Efeserne 3

  1.  Det er for denne Sags Skyld, at jeg, Paulus, Kristi Jesu Fange
      for eder, I Hedninger,
  2.  om I da have hørt om Husholdningen med den Guds Nåde, som blev
      given mig til eder,
  3.  at ved Åbenbarelse blev Hemmeligheden kundgjort mig, således som
      jeg foran kortelig har skrevet,
  4.  hvoraf I, når I læse det, kunne skønne min Indsigt i Kristi
      Hemmelighed,
  5.  som i andre Slægter ikke blev kundgjort for Menneskenes Børn,
      således som den nu er bleven åbenbaret hans hellige Apostle og
      Profeter ved Ånden:
  6.  nemlig at Hedningerne ere Medarvinger og medindlemmede og
      meddelagtige i Forjættelsen i Kristus Jesus ved Evangeliet,
  7.  hvis Tjener jeg er bleven ifølge den Guds Nådes Gave, som blev
      given mig ved hans Magts Virkekraft.
  8.  Mig, den allerringeste af alle hellige, blev denne Nåde given at
      forkynde Hedningerne Evangeliet om Kristi uransagelige Rigdom
  9.  og at oplyse alle om, hvilken Husholdningen med den Hemmelighed
      er, som fra Evighed har været skjult i Gud, der skabte alle
      Ting,
 10.  for at Guds mangfoldige Visdom skulde nu ved Menigheden blive
      kundgjort for Magterne og Myndighederne i det himmelske,
 11.  efter det evige Forsæt, som han fuldbyrdede ved Kristus Jesus,
      vor Herre,
 12.  i hvem vi have Frimodigheden og Adgang med Tillid ved Troen på
      ham.
 13.  Derfor beder jeg, at I ikke tabe Modet over mine Trængsler, som
      jeg lider for eder, hvilket er en Ære for eder.

 14.  For denne Sags Skyld bøjer jeg mine Knæ for Faderen,
 15.  fra hvem enhver Faderlighed i Himle og på Jord har sit Navn,
 16.  at han vil give eder efter sin Herligheds Rigdom mægtigt at
      styrkes ved hans Ånd i det indvortes Menneske;
 17.  at Kristus må bo ved Troen i eders Hjerter,
 18.  for at I, rodfæstede og grundfæstede i Kærlighed, kunne sammen
      med alle de hellige formå at begribe, hvor stor Bredden og
      Længden og Dybden og Højden er,
 19.  og at kende Kristi Kærlighed, som overgår al Erkendelse, for at
      I kunne fyldes indtil hele Guds Fylde.

 20.  Men ham, som formår over alle Ting at gøre langt ud over det,
      som vi bede eller forstå, efter den Magt, som er virksom i os,
 21.  ham være Ære i Menigheden og i Kristus Jesus igennem alle
      Slægterne i Evighedernes Evighed! Amen.

Efeserne 4

  1.  Jeg formaner eder derfor, jeg, der fangne i Herren, til at
      vandre værdig den Kaldelse, med hvilken I bleve kaldede,
  2.  med al Ydmyghed og Sagtmodighed, med Langmodighed, så I bære
      over med hverandre i Kærlighed
  3.  og gøre eder Flid for at bevare Åndens Enhed i Fredens Bånd;
  4.  eet Legeme og een Ånd, ligesom I også bleve kaldede til eet Håb
      i eders Kaldelse;
  5.  een Herre, een Tro, een Dåb,
  6.  een Gud og alles Fader, som er over alle og igennem alle og i
      alle!

  7.  Men hver enkelt af os blev Nåden given efter Kristi Gaves Mål.
  8.  Derfor hedder det: "Da han opfor til det høje, bortførte han
      Fanger og gav Menneskene Gaver."
  9.  Men dette: "Han opfor," hvad er det, uden at han også nedfor til
      Jordens nedre Egne.
 10.  Han, som nedfor, han er også den, som opfor højt over alle.
      Himlene, for at han skulde fylde alle Ting.
 11.  Og han gav nogle som Apostle, andre som Profeter, andre som
      Evangelister, andre som Hyrder og Lærere,
 12.  til de helliges fuldkomne Beredelse, til en Tjenestegerning, til
      Kristi Legemes Opbyggelse,
 13.  indtil vi alle nå til Enheden i Troen på og Erkendelsen af Guds
      Søn, til Mands Modenhed, til Kristi Fyldes Mål af Vækst,
 14.  for at vi ikke; mere skulle være umyndige, der omtumles og
      omdrives af enhver Lærdommens Vind, ved Menneskenes Tærningspil,
      ved Træskhed efter Vildfarelsens Rænkespind;
 15.  men for at vi, Sandheden tro i Kærlighed, skulle i alle Måder
      opvokse til ham, som er Hovedet, Kristus,
 16.  ud fra hvem hele Legemet, idet det sammenføjes og sammenknyttes
      ved ethvert hjælpende Bindeled i Forhold til hver enkelt Dels
      tilmålte Virkekraft, fuldbyrder Legemets Vækst til Opbyggelse af
      sig selv i Kærlighed.

 17.  Dette siger jeg da og vidner i Herren, at I skulle ikke mere
      vandre, således som Hedningerne vandre i deres Sinds Tomhed,
 18.  formørkede i deres Tanke, fremmedgjorte for Guds Liv som Følge
      af den Vankundighed, som er i dem på Grund af deres Hjertes
      Forhærdelse,
 19.  de, som jo følesløse have hengivet sig til Uterligheden, til at
      øve al Urenhed i Havesyge.
 20.  Men I have ikke således lært Kristus,
 21.  om I da have hørt om ham og ere blevne oplærte i ham, således
      som Sandhed er i Jesus,
 22.  at I, hvad eders forrige Vandel angår, skulle aflægge det gamle
      Menneske, som fordærves ved bedrageriske Begæringer,
 23.  men fornyes i eders Sinds Ånd
 24.  og iføre eder det nye Menneske, som blev skabt efter Gud i
      Sandhedens Retfærdighed og Hellighed.

 25.  Derfor aflægger Løgnen og taler Sandhed, hver med sin Næste,
      efterdi vi ere hverandres Lemmer.
 26.  Blive I vrede, da synder ikke; lad ikke Solen gå ned over eders
      Forbitrelse;
 27.  giver ikke heller Djævelen Rum!
 28.  Den, som stjæler, stjæle ikke mere, men arbejde hellere og gøre
      det gode med sine egne Hænder, for at han kan have noget at
      meddele den, som er i Trang.
 29.  Lad ingen rådden Tale udgå af eders Mund, men sådan Tale, som er
      god til fornøden Opbyggelse, for at den kan skaffe dem Nåde, som
      høre derpå;
 30.  og bedrøver ikke Guds hellige Ånd, med hvilken I bleve beseglede
      til Forløsningens Dag.
 31.  Al Bitterhed og Hidsighed og Vrede og Skrigen og Forhånelse
      blive langt fra eder tillige med al Ondskab!
 32.  Men vorder velvillige imod hverandre, barmhjertige, tilgivende
      hverandre, ligesom jo Gud har tilgivet eder i Kristus.

Efeserne 5

  1.  Vorder derfor Guds Efterlignere som elskede Børn,
  2.  og vandrer i Kærlighed, ligesom også Kristus elskede os og gav
      sig selv hen for os som en Gave og et Slagtoffer, Gud til en
      velbehagelig Lugt.

  3.  Men Utugt og al Urenhed eller Havesyge bør end ikke nævnes
      iblandt eder, som det sømmer sig for hellige,
  4.  ej heller ublu Væsen eller dårlig Snak eller letfærdig Skæmt,
      hvilket er utilbørligt, men hellere Taksigelse.
  5.  Thi dette vide og erkende I, at ingen utugtig eller uren eller
      havesyg, hvilket er en Afgudsdyrker, har Arv i Kristi og Guds
      Rige.
  6.  Ingen bedrage eder med tomme Ord; thi for disse Ting kommer Guds
      Vrede over Genstridighedens Børn.
  7.  Derfor, bliver ikke meddelagtige med dem!
  8.  Thi I vare forhen Mørke, men nu ere I Lys i Herren; vandrer som
      Lysets Børn;
  9.  (Lysets Frugt viser sig jo i al Godhed og Retfærdighed og
      Sandhed,)
 10.  så I prøve, hvad der er velbehageligt for Herren.
 11.  Og haver ikke Samfund med Mørkets ufrugtbare Gerninger. Men
      revser dem hellere;
 12.  thi hvad der lønligt bedrives af dem, er skammeligt endog at
      sige;
 13.  men alt dette bliver åbenbaret, når det revses af Lyset. Thi alt
      det, som bliver åbenbaret, er Lys.
 14.  Derfor hedder det: "Vågn op, du, som sover, og stå op fra de
      døde, og Kristus skal lyse for dig!"

 15.  Ser derfor nøje til, hvorledes I vandre, ikke som uvise, men som
      vise,
 16.  så I købe den belejlige Tid, efterdi Dagene ere onde.
 17.  Derfor bliver ikke uforstandige, men skønner, hvad Herrens
      Villie er.
 18.  Og drikker eder ikke drukne i Vin, i hvilket der er
      Ryggesløshed, men lader eder fylde med Ånden,
 19.  så I tale hverandre til med Salmer og Lovsange og åndelige Viser
      og synge og spille i eders Hjerte for Herren
 20.  og altid sige Gud og Faderen Tak for alle Ting i vor Herres Jesu
      Kristi Navn
 21.  og underordne eder under hverandre i Kristi Frygt;

 22.  Hustruerne skulle underordne sig under deres egne Mænd, som
      under Herren;
 23.  thi en Mand er sin Hustrus Hoved, ligesom også Kristus er
      Menighedens Hoved. Han er sit Legemes Frelser.
 24.  Dog, ligesom Menigheden underordner sig under Kristus, således
      skulle også Hustruerne underordne sig under deres Mænd i alle
      Ting.
 25.  I Mænd! elsker eders Hustruer, ligesom også Kristus elskede
      Menigheden og hengav sig selv for den,
 26.  for at han kunde hellige den, idet han rensede den ved Vandbadet
      med et Ord,
 27.  for at han selv kunde fremstille Menigheden for sig som herlig,
      uden Plet eller Rynke eller noget deslige, men for at den måtte
      være hellig og ulastelig.
 28.  Således ere Mændene skyldige at elske deres egne Hustruer som
      deres egne Legemer; den,som elsker sin egen Hustru, elsker sig
      selv.
 29.  Ingen har jo nogen Sinde hadet sit eget Kød, men han nærer og
      plejer det, ligesom også Kristus Menigheden.
 30.  Thi vi ere Lemmer på hans Legeme.
 31.  Derfor skal et Menneske forlade sin Fader og Moder og holde fast
      ved sin Hustru, og de to skulle være eet Kød.
 32.  Denne Hemmelighed er stor - jeg sigter nemlig til Kristus og til
      Menigheden.
 33.  Dog, også I skulle elske hver især sin egen Hustru som sig selv;
      men Hustruen have Ærefrygt for Manden!

Efeserne 6

  1.  I Børn! adlyder eders Forældre i Herren, thi dette er ret.
  2.  "Ær din Fader og Moder", dette er jo det første Bud med
      Forjættelse,
  3.  "for at det må gå dig vel, og du må leve længe i Landet."
  4.  Og I Fædre! opirrer ikke eders Børn, men opfostrer dem i Herrens
      Tugt og Formaning!
  5.  I Trælle! adlyder eders Herrer efter Kødet med Frygt og Bæven i
      eders Hjertes Enfold som Kristus;
  6.  ikke med Øjentjeneste, som de, der ville tækkes Mennesker, men
      som Kristi Tjenere, så I gøre Guds Villie af Hjertet,
  7.  idet I med god Villie gøre Tjeneste som for Herren, og ikke for
      Mennesker,
  8.  idet I vide, at hvad godt enhver gør, det skal han få igen af
      Herren, hvad enten han er Træl eller fri.
  9.  Og I Herrer! gører det samme imod dem, så I lade Trusel fare,
      idet I vide, at både deres og eders Herre er i Himlene, og der
      er ikke Persons Anseelse hos ham.

 10.  For øvrigt bliver stærke i Herren og i hans Styrkes Vælde!
 11.  Ifører eder Guds fulde Rustning, for at I må kunne bolde Stand
      imod Djævelens snedige Anløb.
 12.  Thi for os står Kampen ikke imod Blod og Kød, men imod Magterne,
      imod Myndighederne, imod Verdensherskerne i dette Mørke, imod
      Ondskabens Åndemagter i det himmelske.
 13.  Derfor tager Guds fulde Rustning på, for at I må kunne stå imod
      på den onde Dag og bestå efter at have fuldbyrdet alt.
 14.  Så står da omgjordede om eders Lænd med Sandhed og iførte
      Retfærdighedens Panser.
 15.  Fødderne ombundne med Kampberedthed fra Fredens Evangelium;
 16.  og i alle Forhold løfter Troens Skjold, med hvilket I ville
      kunne slukke alle den ondes gloende Pile,
 17.  og tager imod Frelsens Hjelm og Åndens Sværd, som er Guds Ord,
 18.  idet I under al Påkaldelse og Bøn bede til enhver Tid i Ånden og
      ere årvågne dertil i al Vedholdenhed og Bøn for alle de hellige,
 19.  også for mig, om at der må gives mig Ord, når jeg oplader min
      Mund, til med Frimodighed at kundgøre Evangeliets Hemmelighed,
 20.  for hvis Skyld jeg er et Sendebud i Lænker, for at jeg må have
      Frimodighed deri til at tale, som jeg bør.

 21.  Men for at også I skulle kende mine Forhold, hvorledes det går
      mig, da skal Tykikus, den elskede Broder og tro Tjener i Herren
      kundgøre eder alt;
 22.  ham sender jeg til eder, just for at I skulle lære at kende,
      hvorledes det står til hos os, og for at han skal opmuntre eders
      Hjerter.

 23.  Fred være med Brødrene og Kærlighed med Tro fra Gud Fader og den
      Herre Jesus Kristus!
 24.  Nåden være med alle dem, som elske vor Herre Jesus Kristus i
      Uforkrænkelighed!


Filipperne

Filipperne 1

  1.  Paulus og Timotheus, Kristi Jesu Tjener, til alle de hellige i
      Kristus Jesus, som ere i Filippi, med Tilsynsmænd og
      Menighedstjenere.
  2.  Nåde være med eder og Fred fra Gud vor Fader og den Herre Jesus
      Kristus!

  3.  Jeg takker min Gud, så ofte jeg kommer eder i Hu,
  4.  idet jeg altid, i hver min Bøn, beder for eder alle med Glæde,
  5.  for eders Deltagelse i Evangeliet fra den første Dag indtil nu;
  6.  forvisset om dette, at han, som begyndte en god Gerning i eder,
      vil fuldføre den indtil Jesu Kristi Dag,
  7.  således som det jo er ret for mig at mene dette om eder alle,
      efterdi jeg har eder i Hjertet både under mine Lænker og under
      Evangeliets Forsvar og Stadfæstelse, fælles som I jo alle ere
      med mig om Nåden.
  8.  Thi Gud er mit Vidne, hvorledes jeg længes efter eder alle med
      Kristi Jesu inderlige Kærlighed.
  9.  Og derom beder jeg, at eders Kærlighed fremdeles må blive mere
      og mere rig på Erkendelse og al Skønsomhed,
 10.  så I kunne værdsætte de forskellige Ting, for at I må være rene
      og uden Anstød til Kristi Dag,
 11.  fyldte med Retfærdigheds Frugt, som virkes ved Jesus Kristus,
      Gud til Ære og Pris.

 12.  Men jeg vil, I skulle vide, Brødre! at mine Forhold snarere have
      tjent til Evangeliets Fremme,
 13.  så at det er blevet åbenbart for hele Livvagten og for alle de
      øvrige, at mine Lænker bæres for Kristi Skyld,
 14.  og de fleste af Brødrene fik i Tillid til Herren ved mine Lænker
      end mere Dristighed til at tale Guds Ord uden Frygt.
 15.  Nogle prædike vel også Kristus for Avinds og Kivs Skyld, men
      nogle også i en god Mening.
 16.  Disse gøre det af Kærlighed, vidende, at jeg er sat til at
      forsvare Evangeliet;
 17.  men hine forkynde Kristus af Egennytte, ikke ærligt, men i den
      Tanke at føje Trængsel til mine Lænker.
 18.  Hvad så? Kristus forkyndes dog på enhver Måde, være sig på
      Skrømt eller i Sandhed; og derover glæder jeg mig, og jeg vil
      også fremdeles glæde mig.
 19.  Thi jeg ved, at dette skal blive mig til Frelse ved eders Bøn og
      Jesu Kristi Ånds Hjælp,
 20.  efter min Længsel og mit Håb, at jeg i intet skal blive til
      Skamme, men at Kristus skal med al Frimodighed, som altid, så
      også nu, forherliges i mit Legeme, være sig ved Liv eller ved
      Død.
 21.  Thi det at leve er mig Kristus og at dø en Vinding.
 22.  Men dersom dette at leve i Kødet skaffer mig Frugt af min
      Gerning, så ved jeg ikke, hvad jeg skal vælge;
 23.  men jeg står tvivlrådig imellem de to Ting, idet jeg har Lysten
      til at bryde op og være sammen med Kristus; thi dette var såre
      meget bedre;
 24.  men at forblive i Kødet er mere nødvendigt for eders Skyld.
 25.  Og i Forvisning herom ved jeg, at jeg skal blive i Live og
      forblive hos eder alle til eders Fremgang og Glæde i Troen,
 26.  for at eders Ros ved mig kan blive rig i Kristus Jesus, ved at
      jeg atter kommer til Stede iblandt eder.

 27.  Kun skulle I leve Kristi Evangelium værdigt, for at, hvad enten
      jeg kommer og ser eder eller er fraværende, jeg dog kan høre om
      eder, at I stå faste i een Ånd, så at I med een Sjæl stride
      tilsammen for Troen på Evangeliet
 28.  og ikke lade eder forfærde i nogen Ting af Modstanderne; thi
      dette er for dem et Tegn på Undergang, men for eder på Frelse,
      og det fra Gud.
 29.  Thi eder er det forundt for Kristi Skyld - ikke alene at tro på
      ham, men også at lide for hans Skyld,
 30.  idet I have den samme Kamp, som I have set på mig og nu høre om
      mig.

Filipperne 2

  1.  Er der da nogen Formaning i Kristus, er der nogen Kærlighedens
      Opmuntring, er der noget Åndens Samfund, er der nogen inderlig
      Kærlighed og Barmhjertighed:
  2.  da fuldkommer min Glæde, at I må være enige indbyrdes, så I have
      den samme Kærlighed, samme Sjæl, een Higen,
  3.  intet gøre af Egennytte eller Lyst til tom Ære, men i Ydmyghed
      agte hverandre højere end eder selv
  4.  og ikke se hver på sit, men enhver også på andres.
  5.  Det samme Sindelag være i eder, som også var i Kristus Jesus,
  6.  han, som, da han var i Guds Skikkelse ikke holdt det for et Rov
      at være Gud lig,
  7.  men forringede sig selv, idet han tog en Tjeners Skikkelse på og
      blev Mennesker lig;
  8.  og da han i Fremtræden fandtes som et Menneske, fornedrede han
      sig selv, så han blev lydig indtil Døden, ja, Korsdøden.
  9.  Derfor har også Gud højt ophøjet ham og skænket ham det Navn,
      som er over alle Navne,
 10.  for at i Jesu Navn hvert Knæ skal bøje sig, deres i Himmelen og
      på Jorden og under Jorden,
 11.  og hver Tunge skal bekende, at Jesus Kristus er Herre, til Gud
      Faders Ære.

 12.  Derfor, mine elskede! ligesom I altid have været lydige, så
      arbejder ikke alene som i min Nærværelse, men nu meget mere i
      min Fraværelse på eders egen Frelse med Frygt og Bæven;
 13.  thi Gud er den, som virker i eder både at ville og at virke,
      efter sit Velbehag.
 14.  Gører alle Ting uden Knurren og Betænkeligheder,
 15.  for at I må blive udadlelige og rene, Guds ulastelige Børn, midt
      i en vanartet og forvendt Slægt, iblandt hvilke I vise eder som
      Himmellys i Verden,
 16.  idet I fremholde Livets Ord, mig til Ros på Kristi Dag, at jeg
      ikke har løbet forgæves, ej heller arbejdet forgæves.
 17.  Ja, selv om jeg bliver ofret under Ofringen og Betjeningen af
      eders Tro, så glæder jeg mig og glæder mig med eder alle.
 18.  Men ligeledes skulle også I glæde eder, og glæde eder med mig!


 19.  Men jeg håber i den Herre Jesus snart at kunne sende Timotheus
      til eder, for at også jeg kan blive ved godt Mod ved at erfare,
      hvorledes det går eder.
 20.  Thi jeg har ingen ligesindet, der så oprigtig vil have Omsorg
      for, hvorledes det går eder;
 21.  thi de søge alle deres eget, ikke hvad der hører Kristus Jesus
      til.
 22.  Men hans prøvede Troskab kende I, at, ligesom et Barn tjener sin
      Fader, således har han tjent med mig for Evangeliet.
 23.  Ham håber jeg altså at sende straks, når jeg ser Udgangen på min
      Sag.
 24.  Men jeg har den Tillid til Herren, at jeg også selv snart skal
      komme.

 25.  Men jeg har agtet det nødvendigt at sende Epafroditus til eder,
      min Broder og Medarbejder og Medstrider, og eders Udsending og
      Tjener for min Trang,
 26.  efterdi han længtes efter eder alle og var såre ængstelig, fordi
      I havde hørt, at han var bleven syg.
 27.  Ja, han var også syg og Døden nær; men Gud forbarmede sig over
      ham, ja, ikke alene over ham, men også over mig, for at jeg ikke
      skulde have Sorg på Sorg.
 28.  Derfor skynder jeg mig desto mere med at sende ham, for at I og
      jeg være mere sorgfri.
 29.  Modtager ham altså i Herren med al Glæde og holder sådanne i
      Ære;
 30.  thi for Kristi Gernings Skyld kom han Døden nær, idet han satte
      sit Liv i Vove for at udfylde Savnet af eder i eders Tjeneste
      imod mig.

Filipperne 3

  1.  I øvrigt, mine Brødre glæder eder i Herren! At skrive det samme
      til eder er ikke til Besvær for mig, men er betryggende for
      eder.
  2.  Holder Øje med Hundene, holder Øje med de slette Arbejdere,
      holder Øje med Sønderskærelsen!
  3.  Thi vi ere Omskærelsen, vi, som tjene i Guds Ånd og rose os i
      Kristus Jesus og ikke forlade os på Kødet",
  4.  endskønt også jeg har det, jeg kunde forlade mig på også i
      Kødet, Dersom nogen anden synes, han kan forlade sig på Kødet,
      kan jeg det mere.
  5.  Jeg er omskåren på den ottende Dag, af Israels Slægt, Benjamins
      Stamme, en Hebræer af Hebræere, over for Loven en Farisæer,
  6.  i Nidkærhed en Forfølger af Menigheden, i Retfærdigheden efter
      Loven udadlelig.
  7.  Men hvad der var mig Vinding, det har jeg for Kristi Skyld agtet
      for Tab;
  8.  ja sandelig, jeg agter endog alt for at være Tab imod det langt
      højere, at kende Kristus Jesus, min Herre, for hvis Skyld jeg
      har lidt Tab på alt og agter det for Skarn, for at jeg kan vinde
      Kristus
  9.  og findes i ham, så jeg ikke har min Retfærdighed, den af Loven,
      men den ved Tro på Kristus, Retfærdigheden fra Gud på Grundlag
      af Troen,
 10.  for at jeg må kende ham og hans Opstandelses Kraft og hans
      Lidelsers Samfund, idet jeg bliver ligedannet med hans Død,
 11.  om jeg dog kunde nå til Opstandelsen fra de døde.

 12.  Ikke at jeg allerede har grebet det eller allerede er
      fuldkommen; men jeg jager derefter, om jeg dog kunde gribe det,
      efterdi jeg også er greben af Kristus Jesus.
 13.  Brødre! jeg mener ikke om mig selv, at jeg har grebet det.
 14.  Men eet gør jeg: glemmende, hvad der er bagved, men rækkende
      efter det, som er foran, jager jeg imod Målet, til den
      Sejrspris, hvortil Gud fra det høje kaldte os i Kristus Jesus.
 15.  Lader da os, så mange som ere fuldkomne, have dette Sindelag; og
      er der noget, hvori I ere anderledes sindede, da skal Gud
      åbenbare eder også dette.
 16.  Kun at vi, så vidt vi ere komne, vandre i samme Retning.

 17.  Vorder mine Efterlignere, Brødre! og agter på dem, der vandre
      således, som I have os til Forbillede.
 18.  Thi mange vandre, som jeg ofte har sagt eder, men nu også siger
      med Tårer, som Kristi Kors's Fjender,
 19.  hvis Ende er Fortabelse, hvis Gud er Bugen, og hvis Ære er i
      deres Skændsel, de, som tragte efter de jordiske Ting.
 20.  Thi vort Borgerskab er i Himlene, hvorfra vi også forvente som
      Frelser den Herre Jesus Kristus,
 21.  der skal forvandle vort Fornedrelses-Legeme til at blive
      ligedannet med hans Herligheds-Legeme, efter den Kraft, ved
      hvilken han også kan underlægge sig alle Ting.

  1.  Derfor, mine Brødre, elskede og savnede, min Glæde og Krans!
      står således fast i Herren, I elskede!

  2.  Evodia formaner jeg, og Syntyke formaner jeg til at være enige i
      Herren.
  3.  Ja, jeg beder også dig, min ægte Synzygus! tag dig af dem; thi
      de have med mig stridt i Evangeliet, tillige med Klemens og mine
      øvrige Medarbejdere, hvis Navne stå i Livets Bog.

  4.  Glæder eder i Herren altid; atter siger jeg: glæder eder!
  5.  Eders milde Sind vorde kendt af alle Mennesker! Herren er nær!
  6.  Værer ikke bekymrede for noget, men lader i alle Ting eders
      Begæringer komme frem for Gud i Påkaldelse og Bøn med
      Taksigelse;
  7.  og Guds Fred, som overgår al Forstand, skal bevare eders Hjerter
      og eders Tanker i Kristus Jesus.
  8.  I øvrigt, Brødre! alt, hvad der er sandt, hvad der er ærbart,
      hvad der er retfærdigt, hvad der er rent, hvad der er elskeligt,
      hvad der har godt Lov, enhver Dyd og enhver Hæder: lægger eder
      det på Sinde!
  9.  Hvad I både have lært og modtaget og hørt og set på mig, dette
      skulle I gøre, og Fredens Gud skal være med eder.

 10.  Men jeg har højlig glædet mig i Herren over, at I nu omsider ere
      komne til Kræfter, så at I kunne tænke på mit Vel, hvorpå I også
      forhen tænkte, men I manglede Lejlighed.
 11.  Dette siger jeg ikke af Trang; thi jeg har lært at nøjes med
      det, jeg har.
 12.  Jeg forstår at være i ringe Kår, og jeg forstår også at have
      Overflod; i alt og hvert er jeg indviet, både i at mættes og i
      at hungre, både i at have Overflod og i at lide Savn.
 13.  Alt formår jeg i ham, som gør mig stærk.
 14.  Dog gjorde I vel i at tage Del i min Trængsel.
 15.  Men I vide det også selv, Filippensere! at i Evangeliets
      Begyndelse, da jeg drog ud fra Makedonien, var der ingen
      Menighed, som havde Regning med mig over givet og modtaget, uden
      I alene.
 16.  Thi endog i Thessalonika sendte I mig både een og to Gange, hvad
      jeg havde nødig.
 17.  Ikke at jeg attrår Gaven, men jeg attrår den Frugt, som bliver
      rigelig til eders Fordel.
 18.  Nu har jeg nok af alt og har Overflod; jeg har fuldt op efter
      ved Epafroditus at have modtaget eders Gave, en Vellugts-Duft,
      et velkomment Offer, velbehageligt for Gud.
 19.  Men min Gud skal efter sin Rigdom fuldelig give eder alt, hvad I
      have nødig, i Herlighed i Kristus Jesus.
 20.  Men ham, vor Gud og Fader, være Æren i Evigheders Evigheder!
      Amen.

 21.  Hilser hver hellig i Kristus Jesus.
 22.  De Brødre, som ere hos mig, hilse eder. Alle de hellige hilse
      eder, men mest de af Kejserens Hus.
 23.  Den Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde være med eders Ånd!


Kolossenserne

Kolossenserne 1

  1.  Paulus, Kristi Jesu Apostel ved Guds Villie, og Broderen
      Timotheus.
  2.  til de hellige og troende Brødre i Kristus i Kolossæ: Nåde være
      med eder og Fred fra Gud vor Fader!

  3.  Vi takke Gud og vor Herres Jesu Kristi Fader altid, når vi bede
      for eder,
  4.  da vi have hørt om eders Tro på Kristus Jesus og den Kærlighed,
      som I have til alle de hellige
  5.  på Grund af det Håb, som er henlagt til eder i Himlene, om
      hvilket I forud have hørt i Evangeliets Sandheds Ord,
  6.  der er kommet til eder, ligesom det også er i den hele Verden,
      idet det bærer Frugt og vokser, ligesom det også gør iblandt
      eder fra den Dag, I hørte og erkendte Guds Nåde i Sandhed,
  7.  således som I have lært af Epafras, vor elskede Medtjener som er
      en tro Kristi Tjener for eder,
  8.  han, som også gav os eders Kærlighed i Ånden til Kende.

  9.  Derfor have også vi fra den Dag, vi hørte det, ikke ophørt at
      bede for eder og begære, at I måtte fyldes med Erkendelsen af
      hans Villie i al Visdom og åndelige Indsigt
 10.  til at vandre Herren værdigt, til alt Velbehag, idet I bære
      Frugt og vokse i al god Gerning ved Erkendelsen af Gud,
 11.  idet I styrkes med al Styrke efter hans Herligheds Kraft til al
      Udholdenhed og Tålmodighed med Glæde
 12.  og takke Faderen, som gjorde os dygtige til at have Del i de
      helliges Arvelod i Lyset,
 13.  han, som friede os ud af Mørkets Magt og satte os over i sin
      elskede Søns Rige,

 14.  i hvem vi have Forløsningen, Syndernes Forladelse,
 15.  han, som er den usynlige Guds Billede, al Skabnings førstefødte;
 16.  thi i ham bleve alle Ting skabte i Himlene og på Jorden, de
      synlige og de usynlige, være sig Troner eller Herredømmer eller
      Magter eller Myndigheder. Alle Ting ere skabte ved ham og til
      ham;
 17.  og han er forud for alle Ting, og alle Ting bestå ved ham.
 18.  Og han er Legemets Hoved, nemlig Menighedens, han, som er
      Begyndelsen, førstefødt ud af de døde, for at han skulde blive
      den ypperste i alle Ting;
 19.  thi det behagede Gud, at i ham skulde hele Fylden bo,
 20.  og ved ham at forlige alle Ting med sig, være sig dem på Jorden
      eller dem i Himlene, idet han stiftede Fred ved hans Kors's
      Blod.
 21.  Også eder, som fordum vare fremmedgjorte og fjendske af Sindelag
      i eders onde Gerninger,
 22.  har han dog nu forligt i sit Køds Legeme ved Døden for at
      fremstille eder hellige og ulastelige og ustraffelige for sit
      Åsyn,
 23.  så sandt I blive i Troen, grundfæstede og faste, uden at lade
      eder rokke fra Håbet i det Evangelium, som I have hørt, hvilket
      er blevet prædiket i al Skabningen under Himmelen, og hvis
      Tjener jeg Paulus er bleven.

 24.  Nu glæder jeg mig over mine Lidelser for eder, og hvad der
      fattes i Kristi Trængsler, udfylder jeg i mit Kød for hans
      Legeme, som er Menigheden,
 25.  hvis Tjener jeg er bleven efter den Guds Husholdning, som blev
      given mig over for eder, nemlig fuldelig at forkynde Guds Ord,
 26.  den Hemmelighed, der var skjult igennem alle Tider og Slægter,
      men nu er bleven åbenbaret for hans hellige,
 27.  hvem Gud vilde tilkendegive, hvilken Rigdom på Herlighed iblandt
      Hedningerne der ligger i denne Hemmelighed, som er Kristus i
      eder, Herlighedens Håb,
 28.  hvem vi forkynde, idet vi påminde hvert Menneske og lære hvert
      Menneske med al Visdom, for at vi kunne fremstille hvert
      Menneske som fuldkomment i Kristus;
 29.  hvorpå jeg også arbejder, idet jeg kæmper ifølge hans Kraft, som
      virker mægtigt i mig.

Kolossenserne 2

  1.  Thi jeg vil, at I skulle vide, hvor stor en Kamp jeg har for
      eder og for dem i Laodikea og for alle, som ikke have set mit
      Åsyn i Kødet,
  2.  for at deres Hjerter må opmuntres, idet de sammenknyttes i
      Kærlighed og til den fuldvisse Indsigts hele Rigdom, til
      Erkendelse af Guds Hemmelighed, Kristus.
  3.  i hvem alle Visdommens og Kundskabens Skatte findes skjulte.

  4.  Dette siger jeg, for at ingen skal bedrage eder med lokkende
      Tale.
  5.  Thi om jeg også i Kødet er fraværende, så er jeg dog i Ånden hos
      eder og glæder mig ved at se eders Orden og Fastheden i eders
      Tro på Kristus.
  6.  Derfor, ligesom I have modtaget Kristus Jesus, Herren, så
      vandrer i ham,
  7.  idet I ere rodfæstede og opbygges i ham og, stadfæstes ved
      Troen, således som I bleve oplærte, så I vokse i den med
      Taksigelse.
  8.  Ser til, at der ikke skal være nogen, som gør eder til Bytte ved
      den verdslige Visdom og tomt Bedrag efter Menneskers
      Overlevering, efter Verdens Børnelærdom og ikke efter Kristus;

  9.  thi i ham bor Guddommens hele Fylde legemlig,
 10.  og i ham have I eders Fylde, ham, som er Hovedet for al Magt og
      Myndighed;
 11.  i hvem I også ere blevne omskårne med en Omskærelse, som ikke er
      gjort med Hænder, ved Afførelsen af Kødets Legeme, ved Kristi
      Omskærelse,
 12.  idet I bleve begravne med ham i Dåben, i hvilken I også bleve
      medoprejste ved Troen på Guds Virkekraft, som oprejste ham fra
      de døde.
 13.  Også eder, som vare døde i eders Overtrædelser og eders Køds
      Forhud, eder gjorde han levende tillige med ham, idet han tilgav
      os alle vore Overtrædelser
 14.  og udslettede det imod os rettede Gældsbrev med dets Befalinger,
      hvilket gik os imod, og han har taget det bort ved at nagle det
      til Korset;
 15.  efter at have afvæbnet Magterne og Myndighederne, stillede han
      dem åbenlyst til Skue, da han i ham førte dem i Sejrstog.

 16.  Lad derfor ingen dømme eder for Mad eller for Drikke eller i
      Henseende til Højtid eller Nymåne eller Sabbat,
 17.  hvilket er en Skygge af det, som skulde komme, men Legemet er
      Kristi.
 18.  Lad ingen frarøve eder Sejrsprisen, idet han finder Behag i
      Ydmyghed og Dyrkelse af Englene, idet han indlader sig på, hvad
      han har set i Syner, forfængeligt opblæst af sit kødelige Sind,
 19.  og ikke holder fast ved Hovedet, ud fra hvem hele Legemet, idet
      det hjælpes og sammenknyttes ved sine Bindeled og Bånd, vokser
      Guds Vækst.
 20.  Når I med Kristus ere døde fra Verdens Børnelærdom, hvorfor lade
      I eder da pålægge Befalinger, som om I levede i Verden:
 21.  "Tag ikke, smag ikke, rør ikke derved!"
 22.  (hvilket alt er bestemt til at forgå ved at forbruges) efter
      Menneskenes Bud og Lærdomme?
 23.  thi alt dette har Ord for Visdom ved selvgjort Dyrkelse og
      Ydmyghed og Skånselsløshed imod Legemet, ikke ved noget, som er
      Ære værd, kun til Tilfredsstillelse af Kødet.

Kolossenserne 3

  1.  Når I altså, ere blevne oprejste med Kristus, da søger det, som
      er oventil, hvor Kristus sidder ved Guds højre Hånd.
  2.  Tragter efter det, som er oventil, ikke efter det, som er på
      Jorden.
  3.  Thi I ere døde, og eders Liv er skjult med Kristus i Gud.
  4.  Når Kristus, vort Liv, åbenbares, da skulle også I åbenbares med
      ham i Herlighed.

  5.  Så døder da de jordiske Lemmer, Utugt Urenhed, Brynde, ondt
      Begær og Havesygen, som jo er Afgudsdyrkelse;
  6.  for disse Tings Skyld kommer Guds Vrede.
  7.  I dem vandrede også I fordum, da I levede deri.
  8.  Men nu skulle også I aflægge det alt sammen, Vrede, Hidsighed,
      Ondskab, Forhånelse, slem Snak af eders Mund.
  9.  Lyver ikke for hverandre, da I have afført eder det gamle
      Menneske med dets Gerninger
 10.  og iført eder det nye, som fornyes til Erkendelse efter hans
      Billede, der skabte det;
 11.  hvor der ikke er Græker og Jøde, Omskærelse og Forhud, Barbar,
      Skyther, Træl, fri, men Kristus er alt og i alle.

 12.  Så ifører eder da som Guds udvalgte, hellige og elskede inderlig
      Barmhjertighed, Godhed, Ydmyghed, Sagtmodighed, Langmodighed,
 13.  så I bære over med hverandre og tilgive hverandre,dersom nogen
      har Klagemål imod nogen; ligesom Kristus tilgav eder, således
      også I!
 14.  Men over alt dette skulle I iføre eder Kærligheden, hvilket er
      Fuldkommenhedens Bånd.
 15.  Og Kristi Fred råde i eders Hjerter, til hvilken I også bleve
      kaldede i eet Legeme; og vorder taknemmelige!
 16.  Lad Kristi Ord bo rigeligt iblandt eder, så I med al Visdom lære
      og påminde hverandre med Salmer, Lovsange og åndelige Viser,
      idet I synge med Ynde i eders Hjerter for Gud.
 17.  Og alt, hvad I gøre i Ord eller i Handling, det gører alt i den
      Herres Jesu Navn, takkende Gud Fader ved ham.

 18.  I Hustruer! underordner eder under eders Mænd, som det sømmer
      sig i Herren.
 19.  I Mænd! elsker eders Hustruer, og værer ikke bitre imod dem!
 20.  I Børn! adlyder i alle Ting eders Forældre, thi dette er
      velbehageligt i Herren.
 21.  I Fædre! opirrer ikke eders Børn, for at de ikke skulle tabe
      Modet.
 22.  I Trælle! adlyder i alle Ting eders Herrer efter Kødet, ikke med
      Øjentjeneste som de, der ville tækkes Mennesker, men i Hjertets
      Enfold, frygtende Herren.
 23.  Hvad I end foretage eder, så gører det af Hjertet, som for
      Herren og ikke for Mennesker,
 24.  da I vide, at I af Herren skulle få Arven til Vederlag; det er
      den Herre Kristus, I tjene.
 25.  Thi den, som gør Uret, skal få igen, hvad Uret han gjorde, og
      der er ikke Persons Anseelse.
4-1.  I Herrer! yder eders Trælle, hvad ret og billigt er, da I vide,
      at også I have en Herre i Himmelen.

Kolossenserne 4
  2.  Værer vedholdendene i; Bønnen, idet I ere årvågne i den med
      Taksigelse.
  3.  idet I tillige bede også for os, at Gud vil oplade os en Ordets
      Dør til at tale Kristi Hemmelighed, for hvis Skyld jeg også er
      bunden,
  4.  for at jeg kan åbenbare den således, som jeg bør tale.

  5.  Vandrer i Visdom overfor dem, som ere udenfor, så I købe den
      belejlige Tid.
  6.  Eders Tale være altid med Ynde, krydret med Salt, så I vide,
      hvorledes I bør svare enhver især.

  7.  Hvorledes det går mig, skal Tykikus, den elskede Broder og tro
      Tjener og Medtjener i Herren, kundgøre eder alt sammen;
  8.  ham sender jeg til eder, netop for at I skulle lære at kende,
      hvorledes det står til med os, og for at han skal opmuntre eders
      Hjerter,
  9.  tillige med Onesimus, den tro og elskede Broder, som er fra
      eders By; de skulle fortælle eder, hvorledes alt står til her.

 10.  Aristarkus, min Medfange, hilser eder, og Markus, Barnabas's
      Søskendebarn, om hvem I have fået Befalinger - dersom han kommer
      til eder, da tager imod ham -
 11.  og Jesus, som kaldes Justus, hvilke af de omskårne ere de eneste
      Medarbejdere for Guds Rige, som ere blevne mig en Trøst.
 12.  Epafras hilser eder, han, som er fra eders By, en Kristi Jesu
      Tjener, som altid strider for eder i sine Bønner, før at I må
      stå fuldkomne og fuldvisse i al Guds Villie.
 13.  Thi jeg giver ham det Vidnesbyrd, at han har megen Møje for eder
      og dem i Laodikea og dem i Hierapolis,
 14.  Lægen Lukas, den elskede, hilser eder, og Demas.
 15.  Hilser Brødrene i Laodikea og Nymfas og Menigheden i deres Hus.
 16.  Og når dette Brev er oplæst hos eder, da sørger for, at det også
      bliver oplæst i Laodikensernes Menighed, og at I også læse
      Brevet fra Laodikea.
 17.  Og siger til Arkippus: Giv Agt på den Tjeneste, som du har
      modtaget i Herren, at du fuldbyrder den.

 18.  Hilsenen med min, Paulus's, egen Hånd. Kommer mine Lænker i Hu
      Nåde være med eder!


1.Tessalonikerne

1.Tessalonikerne 1

  1.  Paulus og Silvanus og Timotheus til Thessalonikernes Menighed i
      Gud Fader og den Herre Jesus Kristus. Nåde være med eder og
      Fred!

  2.  Vi takke Gud altid for eder alle, når vi komme eder i Hu i vore
      Bønner,
  3.  idet vi uafladelig mindes eders Gerning i Troen og eders Arbejde
      i Kærligheden og eders Udholdenhed i Håbet på vor Herre Jesus
      Kristus for vor Guds og Faders Åsyn,
  4.  efterdi vi kende eders Udvælgelse, I af Gud elskede Brødre,
  5.  at vort Evangelium ikke kom til eder i Ord alene, men også i
      Kraft og i den Helligånd og i fuld Overbevisning, som I jo vide,
      hvorledes vi færdedes iblandt eder for eders Skyld.
  6.  Og I ere blevne vore Efterfølgere, ja, Herrens, idet I modtoge
      Ordet under megen Trængsel med Glæde i den Helligånd,
  7.  så at I ere blevne et Forbillede for alle de troende i
      Makedonien og Akaja;
  8.  thi fra eder har Herrens Ord lydt ud, ikke alene i Makedonien og
      Akaja, men alle Vegne er eders Tro på Gud kommen ud, så at vi
      ikke have nødig at tale derom.
  9.  Thi de forkynde selv om os, hvordan en Indgang vi vandt hos
      eder, og hvorledes I vendte om til Gud fra Afguderne for at
      tjene den levende og sande Gud
 10.  og vente på hans Søn fra Himlene, hvem han oprejste fra de døde,
      Jesus, som frier os fra den kommende Vrede.

1.Tessalonikerne 2

  1.  I vide jo selv, Brødre! at vor Indgang hos eder ikke har været
      forgæves;
  2.  men skønt vi, som I vide, forud havde lidt og vare blevne
      mishandlede i Filippi, fik vi Frimodighed i vor Gud til at tale
      Guds Evangelium til eder under megen Kamp.
  3.  Thi vor Prædiken skyldes ikke Bedrag, ej heller Urenhed og er
      ikke forbunden med Svig;
  4.  men ligesom vi af Gud ere fundne værdige til at få Evangeliet
      betroet, således tale vi, ikke for at behage Mennesker, men Gud,
      som prøver vore Hjerter.
  5.  Thi vor Færd var hverken nogen Sinde med smigrende Tale - som I
      vide - ej heller var den et Skalkeskjul for Havesyge - Gud er
      Vidne;
  6.  ikke heller søgte vi Ære af Mennesker, hverken af eder eller af
      andre, skønt vi som Kristi Apostle nok kunde have været eder til
      Byrde.
  7.  Men vi færdedes med Mildhed iblandt eder. Som når en Moder ammer
      sine egne Børn,
  8.  således fandt vi, af inderlig Kærlighed til eder, en Glæde i at
      dele med eder ikke alene Guds Evangelium, men også vort eget
      Liv, fordi I vare blevne os elskelige.
  9.  I erindre jo, Brødre! vor Møje og Anstrengelse; arbejdende Nat
      og Dag, for ikke at være nogen af eder til Byrde, prædikede vi
      Guds Evangelium for eder.
 10.  I ere Vidner, og Gud, hvor fromt og retfærdigt og ulasteligt vi
      færdedes iblandt eder, som tro;
 11.  ligesom I vide, hvorledes vi formanede og opmuntrede hver enkelt
      af eder som en Fader sine Børn
 12.  og besvore eder, at I skulde vandre Gud værdigt, ham, som kaldte
      eder til sit Rige og sin Herlighed.

 13.  Og derfor takke også vi Gud uafladelig, fordi, da I modtoge Guds
      Ord, som I hørte af os, toge I ikke imod det som Menneskers Ord,
      men som Guds Ord (hvad det sandelig er), hvilket også viser sig
      virksomt i eder, som tro.
 14.  Thi I, Brødre! ere blevne Efterfølgere af Guds Menigheder i
      Judæa i Kristus Jesus, efterdi også I have lidt det samme af
      eders egne Stammefrænder, som de have lidt af Jøderne,
 15.  der både ihjelsloge den Herre Jesus og Profeterne og udjoge os
      og ikke behage Gud og stå alle Mennesker imod,
 16.  idet de forhindre os i at tale til Hedningerne til deres Frelse,
      for til enhver Tid at fylde deres Synders Mål; men Vreden er
      kommen over dem fuldtud.

 17.  Men vi, Brødre! som en stakket Tid have været skilte fra eder i
      det ydre, ikke i Hjertet, vi have gjort os des mere Flid for at
      få eders Ansigt at se, under megen Længsel,
 18.  efterdi vi have haft i Sinde at komme til eder, jeg, Paulus,
      både een og to Gange, og Satan har hindret os deri.
 19.  Thi hvem er vort Håb eller vor Glæde eller vor Hæderskrans, når
      ikke også I ere det for vor Herre Jesus Kristus i hans
      Tilkommelse?
 20.  I ere jo vor Ære og Glæde.

1.Tessalonikerne 3

  1.  Derfor, da vi ikke længer kunde udholde det, besluttede vi at
      lades alene tilbage i Athen,
  2.  og vi sendte Timotheus, vor Broder og Guds Tjener i Kristi
      Evangelium, for at styrke eder og formane eder angående eders
      Tro,
  3.  for at ingen skulde blive vakelmodig i disse Trængsler; I vide
      jo selv, at dertil ere vi bestemte.
  4.  Thi også da vi vare hos eder, sagde vi eder det forud, at vi
      skulde komme til at lide Trængsler, som det også er sket, og som
      I vide.
  5.  Derfor sendte også jeg Bud, da jeg ikke længer kunde udholde
      det, for at få Besked om eders Tro, om måske Fristeren skulde
      have fristet eder, og vor Møje skulde blive forgæves.

  6.  Men nu, da Timotheus er kommen til os fra eder og har bragt os
      godt Budskab om eders Tro og Kærlighed og om, at I altid have os
      i god Ihukommelse, idet I længes efter at se os, ligesom vi
      efter eder:
  7.  så ere vi af den Grund, Brødre! blevne trøstede med Hensyn til
      eder under al vor Nød og Trængsel, ved eders Tro.
  8.  Thi nu leve vi, når I stå fast i Herren.
  9.  Thi hvilken Tak kunne vi bringe Gud for eder til Gengæld for al
      den Glæde; hvormed vi glæde os over eder for vor Guds Åsyn,
 10.  idet vi Nat og Dag inderligt bede om at måtte få eder selv at se
      og råde Bod på eders Tros Mangler?

 11.  Men han selv, vor Gud og Fader, og vor Herre Jesus Kristus styre
      vor Vej til eder!
 12.  Men eder lade Herren vokse og blive overvættes rige i
      Kærligheden til hverandre og til alle, ligesom vi have den til
      eder,
 13.  så at han styrker eders Hjerter og gør dem udadlelige i
      Hellighed for Gud og vor Fader i vor Herres Jesu Tilkommelse med
      alle hans hellige!

1.Tessalonikerne 4

  1.  Så bede vi eder i øvrigt, Brødre! og formane eder i den Herre
      Jesus, at som I jo have lært af os, hvorledes I bør vandre og
      behage Gud, således som I jo også gøre, at I således må gøre end
      yderligere Fremgang.
  2.  I vide jo, hvilke Bud vi gave eder ved den Herre Jesus.
  3.  Thi dette er Guds Villie, eders Helliggørelse, at I afholde eder
      fra Utugt;
  4.  at hver af eder veed at vinde sig sin egen Hustru i Hellighed og
      Ære,
  5.  ikke i Begærings Brynde som Hedningerne, der ikke kende Gud;
  6.  at ingen foruretter og bedrager sin Broder i nogen Sag; thi
      Herren er en Hævner over alt dette, som vi også før have sagt og
      vidnet for eder.
  7.  Thi Gud kaldte os ikke til Urenhed, men til Helliggørelse.
  8.  Derfor altså, den, som foragter dette, han foragter ikke et
      Menneske, men Gud, som også giver sin Helligånd til eder.

  9.  Men om Broderkærligheden have I ikke nødig, at jeg skal skrive
      eder til; thi I ere selv oplærte af Gud til at elske hverandre;
 10.  det gøre I jo også imod alle Brødrene i hele Makedonien; men vi
      formane eder, Brødre! til yderligere Fremgang
 11.  og til at sætte en Ære i at leve stille og varetage hver sit og
      arbejde med eders Hænder, således som vi bød eder,
 12.  for at I kunne vandre sømmeligt over for dem, som ere udenfor,
      og for ikke at trænge til nogen.

 13.  Men vi ville ikke, Brødre! at I skulle være uvidende med Hensyn
      til dem, som sove hen, for at I ikke skulle sørge som de andre,
      der ikke have Håb.
 14.  Thi når vi tro, at Jesus er død og opstanden, da skal også Gud
      ligeså ved Jesus føre de hensovede frem med ham.
 15.  Thi dette sige vi eder med Herrens Ord, at vi levende, som blive
      tilbage til Herrens Tilkommelse, vi skulle ingenlunde komme
      forud for de hensovede.
 16.  Thi Herren selv skal stige ned fra Himmelen med et Tilråb, med
      Overengels Røst og med Guds Basun, og de døde i Kristus skulle
      opstå først;
 17.  derefter skulle vi levende, som blive tilbage, bortrykkes
      tillige med dem i Skyer til at møde Herren i Luften; og så
      skulle vi altid være sammen med Herren.
 18.  Så trøster hverandre med disse Ord!

1.Tessalonikerne 5

  1.  Men om Tid og Time, Brødre! have I ikke nødig, at der skrives
      til eder;
  2.  thi I vide selv grant, at Herrens Dag kommer som en Tyv om
      Natten.
  3.  Når de sige: "Fred og ingen Fare!" da kommer Undergang
      pludselig, over dem ligesom Veerne over den frugtsommelige, og
      de skulle ingenlunde undfly.
  4.  Men I, Brødre! I ere ikke i Mørke, så at Dagen skulde overraske
      eder som en Tyv.
  5.  Thi I ere alle Lysets Børn og Dagens Børn, vi ere ikke Nattens
      eller Mørkets Børn.
  6.  Så lader os da ikke sove ligesom de andre, men lader os våge og
      være ædrue!
  7.  Thi de, som sove, sove om Natten, og de, som beruse sig, ere
      berusede om Natten.
  8.  Men da vi høre Dagen til, så lader os være ædrue, iførte Troens
      og Kærlighedens Panser og Frelsens Håb som Hjelm!
  9.  Thi Gud bestemte os ikke til Vrede, men til at vinde Frelse ved
      vor Herre Jesus Kristus,
 10.  som døde for os, for at vi, hvad enten vi våge eller sove,
      skulle leve sammen med ham.
 11.  Formaner derfor hverandre og opbygger den ene den anden, ligesom
      I også gøre.

 12.  Men vi bede eder, Brødre! at I skønne på dem, som arbejde
      iblandt eder og ere eders Forstandere i Herren og påminde eder,
 13.  og agte dem højlig i Kærlighed for deres Gernings Skyld. Holder
      Fred med hverandre!
 14.  Og vi formane eder, Brødre! påminder de uskikkelige, trøster de
      modfaldne, tager eder af de skrøbelige, værer langmodige imod
      alle!
 15.  Ser til, at ingen gengælder nogen ondt med ondt; men stræber
      altid efter det gode, både imod hverandre og imod alle.
 16.  Værer altid glade,
 17.  beder uafladelig,
 18.  takker i alle Forhold; thi dette er Guds Villie med eder i
      Kristus Jesus.
 19.  Udslukker ikke Ånden,
 20.  ringeagter ikke Profetier,
 21.  prøver alt, beholder det gode!
 22.  Holder eder fra det onde under alle Skikkelser!

 23.  Men han selv, Fredens Gud, helliggøre eder ganske og aldeles, og
      gid eders Ånd og Sjæl og Legeme må bevares helt og holdent, uden
      Dadel i vor Herres Jesu Kristi Tilkommelse!
 24.  Trofast er han, som kaldte eder, han skal også gøre det.

 25.  Brødre! beder for os!
 26.  Hilser alle Brødrene med et helligt Kys!
 27.  Jeg besværger eder ved Herren, at dette Brev må blive oplæst for
      alle de hellige Brødre.
 28.  Vor Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde være med eder!


2.Tessalonikerne

2.Tessalonikerne 1

  1.  Paulus og Silvanus og Timotheus til Thessalonikernes Menighed i
      Gud vor Fader og den Herre Jesus Kristus:
  2.  Nåde være med eder og Fred fra Gud vor Fader og den Herre Jesus
      Kristus!

  3.  Vi ere skyldige altid at takke Gud for eder, Brødre! som
      tilbørligt er, fordi eders Tro vokser overmåde, og den indbyrdes
      Kærlighed forøges hos hver enkelt af eder alle,
  4.  så at vi selv rose os af eder i Guds Menigheder for eders
      Udholdenhed og Tro under alle eders Forfølgelser og de
      Trængsler, som I udstå,
  5.  et Bevis på Guds retfærdige Dom, for at I kunne agtes værdige
      til Guds Rige, for hvilket I også lide;
  6.  hvis ellers det er retfærdigt for Gud at give dem Trængsel til
      Gengæld, som trænge eder,
  7.  og eder, som trænges, Hvile med os ved den Herres Jesu
      Åbenbarelse fra Himmelen med sin Krafts Engle,
  8.  med Lueild, når han tager Hævn over dem, som ikke kende Gud, og
      over dem, som ikke lyde vor Herres Jesu Evangelium,
  9.  de, som jo skulle lide Straf, evig Undergang bort fra Herrens
      Ansigt og fra hans Vældes Herlighed.
 10.  når han kommer for på hin Dag at herliggøres i sine hellige og
      beundres i alle dem, som have troet; thi troet blev vort
      Vidnesbyrd til eder.

 11.  Derfor bede vi også altid for eder, at vor Gud vil agte eder
      Kaldelsen værdige og med Kraft fuldkomme al Lyst til det gode og
      Troens Gerning,
 12.  for at vor Herres Jesu Navn må herliggøres i eder, og I i ham.
      efter vor Guds og den Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde.

2.Tessalonikerne 2

  1.  Men vi bede eder, Brødre! angående vor Herres Jesu Kristi
      Tilkommelse og vor Samling til ham,
  2.  at I ikke i en Hast må lade eder bringe fra Besindelse eller
      forskrække hverken ved nogen Ånd eller ved nogen Tale eller
      Brev, der skulde være fra os, som om Herrens Dag var lige for
      Hånden.
  3.  Lad ingen bedrage eder i nogen Måde; thi først må jo Frafaldet
      komme og Syndens Menneske åbenbares, Fortabelsens Søn,
  4.  han, som sætter sig imod og ophøjer sig over alt. hvad der
      kaldes Gud eller Helligdom, så at han sætter sig i Guds Tempel
      og udgiver sig selv for at være Gud.
  5.  Komme I ikke i Hu, at jeg sagde eder dette, da jeg endnu var hos
      eder?
  6.  Og nu vide I, hvad der holder ham tilbage, indtil han åbenbares
      i sin Tid.
  7.  Thi Lovløshedens Hemmelighed virker allerede, kun at den, som nu
      holder tilbage, først må komme af Vejen
  8.  og da skal den lovløse åbenbares, hvem den Herre Jesus skal
      dræbe med sin Munds Ånde og tilintetgøre ved sin Tilkommelses
      Åbenbarelse,
  9.  han, hvis Komme sker ifølge Satans Kraft, med al Løgnens Magt og
      Tegn og Undere
 10.  og med alt Uretfærdigheds Bedrag for dem, som fortabes, fordi de
      ikke toge imod Kærligheden til Sandheden, så de kunde blive
      frelste.
 11.  Og derfor sender Gud dem kraftig Vildfarelse, så at de tro
      Løgnen,
 12.  for at de skulle dømmes, alle de, som ikke troede Sandheden, men
      fandt Behag i Uretfærdigheden.

 13.  Men vi ere skyldige at takke Gud altid for eder, I af Herren
      elskede Brødre! fordi Gud har udvalgt eder fra Begyndelsen til
      Frelse ved Åndens Helligelse og Tro på Sandheden,
 14.  hvortil han kaldte eder ved vort Evangelium, for at I skulde
      vinde vor Herres Jesu Kristi Herlighed.

 15.  Så står da fast, Brødre! og holder fast ved de Overleveringer,
      hvori I bleve oplærte, være sig ved vor Tale eller vort Brev.
 16.  Men han selv, vor Herre Jesus Kristus og Gud vor Fader, som har
      elsket og givet os en evig Trøst og et godt Håb i Nåde,
 17.  han trøste eders Hjerter og styrke eder i al god Gerning og
      Tale!

2.Tessalonikerne 3

  1.  I øvrigt, Brødre! beder for os, at Herrens Ord må have Løb og
      forherliges ligesom hos eder,
  2.  og at vi må fries fra de vanartige og onde Mennesker; thi Troen
      er ikke alles.
  3.  Men trofast er Herren, som skal styrke eder og bevare eder fra
      det onde;
  4.  og vi have den Tillid til eder i Herren, at I både gøre og ville
      gøre, hvad vi byde.
  5.  Men Herren styre eders Hjerter til Guds Kærlighed og til Kristi
      Udholdenhed!

  6.  Men vi byde eder, Brødre! i vor Herres Jesu Kristi Navn, at I
      holde eder borte fra enhver Broder, som vandrer uskikkeligt og
      ikke efter den Overlevering, som de modtoge af os.
  7.  I vide jo selv, hvorledes I bør efterfølge os. Thi vi have ikke
      levet uskikkeligt iblandt eder,
  8.  ikke heller spiste vi nogens Brød for intet, men arbejdede med
      Møje og Anstrengelse, Nat og Dag,for ikke at være nogen af eder
      til Byrde.
  9.  Ikke fordi vi ikke have Ret dertil; men vi vilde give eder et
      Forbillede i os selv, for at I skulde efterfølge os.
 10.  Også da vi vare hos eder, bød vi eder jo dette, at dersom nogen
      ikke vil arbejde, så skal han heller ikke have Føden!
 11.  Vi høre nemlig, at nogle vandre uskikkeligt iblandt eder, idet
      de ikke arbejde, men tage sig uvedkommende Ting for.
 12.  Sådanne byde og formane vi i den Herre Jesus Kristus, at de
      skulle arbejde i Stilhed og således spise deres eget Brød.
 13.  Men I, Brødre! bliver ikke trætte af at gøre det gode!
 14.  Men dersom nogen ikke lyder vort Ord her i Brevet, da mærker
      eder ham; hav intet Samkvem med ham, for at han må skamme sig!
 15.  Dog skulle I ikke agte ham for en Fjende, men påminde ham som en
      Broder!

 16.  Men han selv, Fredens Herre, give eder Freden altid, i alle
      Måder!  Herren være med eder alle!
 17.  Hilsenen med min, Paulus's, egen Hånd, hvilket er et Mærke i
      hvert Brev. Således skriver jeg.
 18.  Vor Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde være med eder alle!


1.Timoteus

1.Timoteus 1

  1.  Paulus, Kristi Jesu Apostel efter Befaling af Gud, vor Frelser,
      og Kristus Jesus, vort Håb,
  2.  til Timotheus, sit ægte Barn i Troen: Nåde, Barmhjertig Fred fra
      Gud Fader og Kristus Jesus vor Herre!

  3.  Det var derfor, jeg opfordrede dig til at blive i Efesus, da jeg
      drog til Makedonien, for at du skulde påbyde visse Folk ikke at
      føre fremmed Lære
  4.  og ikke at agte på Fabler og Slægtregistre uden Ende, som mere
      fremme Stridigheden end Guds Husholdning i Tro.
  5.  Men Påbudets Endemål er Kærlighed af et rent Hjerte og af en god
      Samvittighed og af en uskrømtet Tro,
  6.  hvorfra nogle ere afvegne og have vendt sig til intetsigende
      Snak,
  7.  idet de ville være Lovlærere uden at forstå, hverken hvad de
      sige, eller hvorom de udtale sig så sikkert.
  8.  Men vi vide, at Loven er god, dersom man bruger den lovmæssigt,
  9.  idet man veed dette, at Loven ikke er sat for den retfærdige,
      men for lovløse og ulydige, ugudelige og Syndere, ryggesløse og
      vanhellige, for dem, som øve Vold imod deres Fader og Moder, for
      Manddrabere,
 10.  utugtige, Syndere imod Naturen, Menneskerøvere, Løgnere,
      Menedere, og hvad andet der er imod den sunde Lære,
 11.  efter den salige Guds Herligheds Evangelium, som er blevet mig
      betroet.

 12.  Jeg takker ham, som gjorde mig stærk, Kristus Jesus, vor Herre,
      fordi han agtede mig for tro, idet han satte mig til en
      Tjeneste,
 13.  skønt jeg forhen var en Bespotter og en Forfølger og en
      Voldsmand; men der blev vist mig Barmhjertighed, thi jeg gjorde
      det vitterligt i Vantro,
 14.  Ja, vor Herres Nåde viste sig overvættes rig med Tro og
      Kærlighed i Kristus Jesus.
 15.  Den Tale er troværdig og al Modtagelse værd, at Kristus Jesus
      kom til Verden for at frelse Syndere, iblandt hvilke jeg er den
      største"
 16.  Men derfor blev der vist mig Barmhjertighed, for at Jesus
      Kristus kunde på mig som den første vise hele sin Langmodighed,
      til et Forbillede på dem, som skulle tro på ham til evigt Liv.
 17.  Men Evighedens Konge, den uforkrænkelige, usynlige, eneste Gud
      være Pris og Ære i Evighedernes Evigheder! Amen.

 18.  Dette Påbud betror jeg dig, mit Barn Timotheus, ifølge de
      Profetier, som tilforn ere udtalte over dig, at du efter dem
      strider den gode Strid,
 19.  idet du har Tro og en god Samvittighed, hvilken nogle have stødt
      fra sig og lidt Skibbrud på Troen;
 20.  iblandt dem ere Hymenæus og Aleksander, hvilke jeg har overgivet
      til Satan, for at de skulle tugtes til ikke at bespotte.

1.Timoteus 2

  1.  Jeg formaner da først af alt til, at der holdes Bønner,
      Påkaldelser, Forbønner, Taksigelser for alle Mennesker,
  2.  for Konger og alle dem, som ere i Højhed, at vi må leve et
      roligt og stille Levned i al Gudsfrygt og Ærbarhed;
  3.  dette er smukt og velbehageligt for Gud, vor Frelser,
  4.  som vil, at alle Mennesker skulle frelses og komme til Sandheds
      Erkendelse.
  5.  Thi der er een Gud, og også een Mellemmand imellem Gud og
      Mennesker, Mennesket Kristus Jesus,
  6.  som gav sig selv til en Genløsnings Betaling for alle, hvilket
      er Vidnesbyrdet i sin Tid,
  7.  og for dette er jeg bleven sat til Prædiker og Apostel (jeg
      siger Sandhed, jeg lyver ikke), en Lærer for Hedninger i Tro og
      Sandhed.

  8.  Så vil jeg da, at Mændene på ethvert Sted, hvor de bede, skulle
      opløfte fromme Hænder uden Vrede og Trætte.
  9.  Ligeså, at Kvinder skulle pryde sig i sømmelig Klædning med
      Blufærdighed og Ærbarhed, ikke med Fletninger og Guld eller
      Perler eller kostbar Klædning,
 10.  men, som det sømmer sig Kvinder, der bekende sig til Gudsfrygt,
      med gode Gerninger.
 11.  En Kvinde bør i Stilhed lade sig belære, med al Lydighed;
 12.  men at være Lærer tilsteder jeg ikke en Kvinde, ikke heller at
      byde over Manden, men at være i Stilhed.
 13.  Thi Adam blev dannet først, derefter Eva;
 14.  og Adam blev ikke bedraget, men Kvinden blev bedraget og er
      falden i Overtrædelse.
 15.  Men hun skal frelses igennem sin Barnefødsel, dersom de blive i
      Tro og Kærlighed og Hellighed med Ærbarhed.

1.Timoteus 3

  1.  Den Tale er troværdig; dersom nogen begærer en Tilsynsgerning
      har han Lyst til en skøn Gerning.
  2.  En Tilsynsmand bør derfor være ulastelig, een Kvindes Mand,
      ædruelig, sindig, høvisk, gæstfri, dygtig til at lære andre;
  3.  ikke hengiven til Vin, ikke til Slagsmål, men mild, ikke
      kivagtig, ikke pengegridsk;
  4.  en Mand, som forestår sit eget Hus vel, som har Børn, der ere
      lydige med al Ærbarhed;
  5.  (dersom en ikke veed at forestå sit eget Hus, hvorledes vil han
      da kunne sørge for Guds Menighed?)
  6.  ikke ny i Troen, som at han ikke skal blive opblæst og falde ind
      under Djævelens Dom.
  7.  Men han bør også have et godt Vidnesbyrd af dem, som ere
      udenfor; for at han ikke skal falde i Forhånelse og Djævelens
      Snare.

  8.  Menighedstjenere bør ligeledes være ærbare, ikke tvetungede,
      ikke hengivne til megen Vin, ikke til slet Vinding,
  9.  bevarende Troens Hemmelighed i en ren Samvittighed.
 10.  Men også disse skulle først prøves, og siden gøre Tjeneste, hvis
      de ere ustrafelige.
 11.  Kvinder bør ligeledes være ærbare, ikke bagtaleriske, ædruelige,
      tro i alle Ting.
 12.  En Menighedstjener skal være een Kvindes Mand og forestå sine
      Børn og sit eget Hus vel.
 13.  Thi de, som have tjent vel i Menigheden, de erhverve sig selv en
      smuk Stilling og megen Frimodighed i Troen på Kristus Jesus.

 14.  Disse Ting skriver jeg dig til, ihvorvel jeg håber at komme
      snart til dig;
 15.  men dersom jeg tøver, da skal du heraf vide, hvorledes man bør
      færdes i Guds Hus, hvilket jo er den levende Guds Menighed,
      Sandhedens Søjle og Grundvold.
 16.  Og uden Modsigelse stor er den Gudsfrygtens Hemmelighed: Han,
      som blev åbenbaret i Kød, blev retfærdiggjort i Ånd, set af
      Engle, prædiket iblandt Hedninger, troet i Verden, optagen i
      Herlighed.

1.Timoteus 4

  1.  Men Ånden siger klarlig, at i kommende Tider ville nogle falde
      fra Troen, idet de agte på forførende Ånder og på Dæmoners
      Lærdomme,
  2.  ved Løgnlæreres Hykleri, som ere brændemærkede i deres egen
      Samvittighed,
  3.  som byde, at man ikke må gifte sig, og at man skal afholde sig
      fra Spiser, hvilke Gud har skabt til at nydes med Taksigelse af
      dem, som tro og have erkendt Sandheden.
  4.  Thi al Guds Skabning er god, og intet er at forkaste, når det
      tages med Taksigelse;
  5.  thi det helliges ved Guds Ord og Bøn.

  6.  Når du foreholder Brødrene dette, er du en god Kristi Jesu
      Tjener, idet du næres ved Troens og den gode Læres Ord, den, som
      du har efterfulgt;
  7.  men afvis de vanhellige og kælingagtige Fabler! Derimod øv dig
      selv i Gudsfrygt!
  8.  Thi den legemlige Øvelse er nyttig til lidet, men Gudsfrygten er
      nyttig til alle Ting, idet den har Forjættelse for det Liv, som
      nu er, og for det, som kommer.
  9.  Den Tale er troværdig og al Modtagelse værd.
 10.  Thi derfor lide vi Møje og Forhånelser, fordi vi have sat vort
      Håb til den levende Gud, som er alle Menneskers Frelser, mest
      deres, som tro.
 11.  Påbyd og lær dette!

 12.  Lad ingen ringeagte dig for din Ungdoms Skyld, men bliv et
      Forbillede for dem, som tro, i Tale, i Vandel, i Kærlighed, i
      Tro, i Renhed!
 13.  Indtil jeg kommer, så giv Agt på Oplæsningen, Formaningen,
      Undervisningen.
 14.  Forsøm ikke den Nådegave, som er i dig, som blev given dig under
      Profeti med Håndspålæggelse af de Ældste.
 15.  Tænk på dette, lev i dette, for at din Fremgang må være åbenbar
      for alle.
 16.  Giv Agt på dig selv og på Undervisningen: hold ved dermed; thi
      når du gør dette,skal du frelse både dig selv og dem, som høre
      dig.

1.Timoteus 5

  1.  En gammel Mand må du ikke skælde på, men forman ham som en
      Fader, unge Mænd som Brødre,
  2.  gamle Kvinder som Mødre, unge som Søstre, i al Renhed.

  3.  Ær Enker, dem, som virkelig ere Enker;
  4.  men om en Enke har Børn eller Børnebørn, da lad dem først lære
      at vise deres eget Hus skyldig Kærlighed og gøre Gengæld imod
      Forældrene; thi dette er velbebageligt for Gud.
  5.  Men den, som virkelig er Enke og står ene, har sat sit Håb til
      Gud og bliver ved med sine Bønner og Påkaldelser Nat og Dag;
  6.  men den, som lever efter sine Lyster, er levende død.
  7.  Forehold dem også dette, for at de må være ulastelige.
  8.  Men dersom nogen ikke har Omsorg for sine egne og især for sine
      Husfæller, han har fornægtet Troen og er værre end en vantro.
  9.  En Enke kan udnævnes når hun er ikke yngre end tresindstyve År,
      har været een Mands Hustru,
 10.  har Vidnesbyrd for gode Gerninger, har opfostret Børn, har vist
      Gæstfrihed, har toet helliges Fødder, har hjulpet nødlidende,
      har lagt sig efter al god Gerning.
 11.  Men afvis unge Enker; thi når de i kødelig Attrå gøre Oprør imod
      Kristus, ville de giftes
 12.  og have så den Dom, at de have sveget deres første Tro.
 13.  Tilmed lære de, idet de løbe omkring i Husene, at være
      ørkesløse, og ikke alene ørkesløse, men også at være
      sladderagtige og blande sig i uvedkommende Ting, idet de tale,
      hvad der er utilbørligt.
 14.  Derfor vil jeg, at unge Enker skulle giftes, føde Børn, styre
      Hus, ingen Anledning give Modstanderen til slet Omtale.
 15.  Thi allerede have nogle vendt sig bort efter Satan.
 16.  Dersom nogen troende Kvinde har Enker, da lad hende hjælpe dem,
      og lad ikke Menigheden bebyrdes, for at den kan hjælpe de
      virkelige Enker.

 17.  De Ældste, som ere gode Forstandere, skal man holde dobbelt Ære
      værd, mest dem, som arbejde i Tale og Undervisning.
 18.  Thi Skriften siger: "Du må ikke binde Munden til på en Okse, som
      tærsker;" og: "Arbejderen er sin Løn værd."
 19.  Tag ikke imod noget Klagemål imod en Ældste, uden efter to eller
      tre Vidner.
 20.  Dem, som Synde, irettesæt dem for alles Åsyn, for at også de
      andre må have Frygt.
 21.  Jeg besværger dig for Guds og Kristi Jesu og de udvalgte Engles
      Åsyn, at du vogter på dette uden Partiskhed, så du intet gør
      efter Tilbøjelighed.
 22.  Vær ikke hastig til at lægge Hænder på nogen, og gør dig ikke
      delagtig i andres Synder; hold dig selv ren!
 23.  Drik ikke længere bare Vand, men nyd lidt Vin for din Mave og
      dine jævnlige Svagheder.
 24.  Nogle Menneskers Synder ere åbenbare og gå forud til Dom; men
      for nogle følge de også bagefter.
 25.  Ligeledes ere også de gode Gerninger åbenbare, og de, som det
      forholder sig anderledes med, kunne ikke skjules.

1.Timoteus 6

  1.  Alle de, som ere Trælle under Åg, skulle holde deres egne Herrer
      al Ære værd, for at ikke Guds Navn og Læren skal bespottes.
  2.  Men de, der have troende Herrer, må ikke ringeagte dem, fordi de
      ere Brødre, men tjene dem desto hellere, fordi de, som nyde godt
      af deres gode Gerning, ere troende og elskede. Lær dette, og
      forman dertil!

  3.  Dersom nogen fører fremmed Lære og ikke holder sig til vor
      Herres Jesu Kristi sunde Ord og til den Lære, som stemmer med
      Gudsfrygt.
  4.  han er opblæst, skønt han intet ved, men er syg for Stridigheder
      og Ordkampe, hvoraf kommer Avind, Kiv, Forhånelser, ond Mistanke
  5.  og idelige Rivninger hos Mennesker, som ere fordærvede i Sindet
      og berøvede Sandheden, idet de mene, at Gudsfrygten er en
      Vinding.
  6.  Vist nok er Gudsfrygten sammen med Nøjsomhed en stor Vinding.
  7.  Thi vi have intet bragt ind i Verden, det er da åbenbart, at vi
      ej heller kunne bringe noget ud derfra.
  8.  Men når vi have Føde og Klæder, ville vi dermed lade os nøje.
  9.  Men de, som ville være rige, falde i Fristelse og Snare og mange
      ufornuftige og skadelige Begæringer, som nedsænke Menneskene i
      Undergang og Fortabelse;
 10.  thi Pengegridskheden er en Rod til alt ondt; og ved at hige
      derefter ere nogle farne vild fra Troen og have gennemstunget
      sig selv med mange Smerter.

 11.  Men du, o Guds Menneske! fly disse Ting; jag derimod efter
      Retfærdighed, Gudsfrygt, Tro, Kærlighed, Udholdenhed,
      Sagtmodighed;
 12.  strid Troens gode Strid, grib det evige Liv, til hvilket du er
      bleven kaldet og har aflagt den gode Bekendelse for mange
      Vidner.
 13.  Jeg byder dig for Guds Åsyn, som holder alle Ting i Live, og for
      Kristus Jesus, som vidnede den gode Bekendelse for Pontius
      Pilatus,
 14.  at du holder Budet uplettet, ulasteligt indtil vor Herres Jesu
      Kristi Åbenbarelse,
 15.  hvilken den salige og alene mægtige, Kongernes Konge og
      Herrernes Herre skal lade til Syne i sin Tid;
 16.  han, som alene har Udødelighed, som bor i et utilgængeligt Lys,
      hvem intet Menneske har set, ikke heller kan se; ham være Ære og
      evig Magt! Amen!

 17.  Byd dem, som ere rige i den nærværende Verden, at de ikke
      hovmode sig, ej heller sætte Håb til den usikre Rigdom, men til
      Gud, som giver os rigeligt alle Ting at nyde;
 18.  at de gøre godt, ere rige på gode Gerninger, gerne give, meddele
 19.  og således, opsamle sig selv en god Grundvold for den kommende
      Tid, for at de kunne gribe det sande Liv.

 20.  O Timotheus! vogt på den betroede Skat, idet du vender dig bort
      fra den vanhellige, tomme Snak og Indvendingerne fra den
      falskelig såkaldte Erkendelse,
 21.  hvilken nogle have bekendt sig til og ere afvegne fra Troen.
      Nåden være med dig!


2.Timoteus

2.Timoteus 1

  1.  Paulus; Kristi Jesu Apostel ved Guds Villie, for at bringe
      Forjættelse om Livet i Kristus Jesus
  2.  - til Timotheus, sit elskede Barn: Nåde, Barmhjertighed og Fred
      fra Gud Fader og Kristus Jesus, vor Herre!

  3.  Jeg takker Gud, hvem jeg fra mine Forfædre af har tjent i en ren
      Samvittighed, ligesom jeg uafladelig har dig i Erindring i mine
      Bønner Nat og Dag,
  4.  da jeg i Mindet om dine Tårer længes efter at se dig, for at jeg
      må fyldes med Glæde,
  5.  idet jeg er bleven mindet om den uskrømtede Tro, som er i dig,
      den, som boede først i din Mormoder Lois og din Moder Eunike, og
      jeg er vis på, at den også bor i dig.

  6.  Derfor påminder jeg dig, at du opflammer den Guds Nådegave, som
      er i dig ved mine Hænders Pålæggelse.
  7.  Thi Gud har ikke givet os Fejgheds Ånd, men Krafts og Kærligheds
      og Sindigheds Ånd.
  8.  Derfor, skam dig ikke ved Vidnesbyrdet om vor Herre eller ved
      mig, hans Fange, men lid ondt med Evangeliet ved Guds Kraft,
  9.  han, som frelste os og kaldte os med en hellig Kaldelse, ikke
      efter vore Gerninger, men efter sit eget Forsæt og Nåden, som
      blev given os i Kristus Jesus fra evige Tider,
 10.  men nu er kommen for Dagen ved vor Frelsers Jesu Kristi
      Åbenbarelse, han, som tilintetgjorde Døden, men bragte Liv og
      Uforkrænkelighed for Lyset ved Evangeliet,
 11.  for hvilket jeg er bleven sat til Prædiker og Apostel og
      Hedningers Lærer,

 12.  hvorfor jeg også lider dette, men jeg skammer mig ikke derved;
      thi jeg ved, til hvem jeg har sat min Tro, og jeg er vis på, at
      han er mægtig til at vogte på den mig betroede Skat til hin Dag.
 13.  Hav et Forbillede i de sunde Ord, som du har hørt af mig, i Tro
      og Kærlighed i Kristus Jesus.
 14.  Vogt på den skønne betroede Skat ved den Helligånd, som bor i
      os.

 15.  Du ved dette, at alle de i Asien have vendt sig fra mig, iblandt
      hvilke ere Fygelus og Hermogenes.
 16.  Herren vise Onesiforus's Hus Barmhjertighed; thi han har ofte
      vederkvæget mig og skammede sig ikke ved min Lænke,
 17.  men da han kom til Rom, søgte han ivrigt efter mig og fandt mig.
 18.  Herren give ham at finde Barmhjertighed fra Herren på hin Dag!
      Og hvor megen Tjeneste han har gjort i Efesus, ved du bedst.

2.Timoteus 2

  1.  Du derfor, mit Barn! bliv stærk ved Nåden i Kristus Jesus;
  2.  og hvad du har hørt af mig for mange Vidner, betro det til
      trofaste Mennesker, som kunne være dygtige også til at lære
      andre.
  3.  Vær med til at lide ondt som en god Kristi Jesu Stridsmand.
  4.  Ingen, som gør Krigstjeneste, indvikler sig i Livets Handeler
      for at han kan behage den, som tog ham i Sold.
  5.  Og ligeså, når nogen møder i Væddekamp, bliver han dog ikke
      bekranset, dersom han ikke kæmper lovmæssigt.
  6.  Den Bonde, som arbejder, bør først have Del i Frugterne.
  7.  Mærk, hvad jeg siger; Herren vil jo give dig Indsigt i alle
      Ting.

  8.  Kom Jesus Kristus i Hu, oprejst fra de døde, af Davids Sæd,
      efter mit Evangelium,
  9.  for hvilket jeg lider ondt lige indtil at være bunden som en
      Misdæder; men Guds Ord er ikke bundet.
 10.  Derfor udholder jeg alt for de udvalgtes Skyld, for at også de
      skulle få Frelsen i Kristus Jesus med evig Herlighed.
 11.  Den Tale er troværdig; thi dersom vi ere døde med ham, skulle vi
      også leve med ham;
 12.  dersom vi holde ud, skulle vi også være Konger med ham; dersom
      vi fornægte, skal også han fornægte os;
 13.  dersom vi ere utro, forbliver han dog tro; thi fornægte sig selv
      kan han ikke.

 14.  påmind om disse Ting, idet du besværger dem for Herrens Åsyn, at
      de ikke kives om Ord, hvilket er til ingen Nytte, men til
      Ødelæggelse for dem, som høre derpå.
 15.  Gør dig Flid for at fremstille dig selv som prøvet for Gud, som
      en, Arbejder, der ikke behøver at skamme sig, som rettelig lærer
      Sandhedens Ord.
 16.  Men hold dig fra den vanhellige, tomme Snak; thi sådanne ville
      stedse gå videre i Ugudelighed,
 17.  og deres Ord vil æde om sig som Kræft. Iblandt dem ere Hymenæus
      og Filetus,
 18.  som ere afvegne fra Sandheden, idet de sige, at Opstandelsen er
      allerede sket, og de forvende Troen hos nogle.

 19.  Dog, Guds faste Grundvold står og har dette Segl: "Herren kender
      sine" og: "Hver den, som nævner Herrens Navn, afstå fra
      Uretfærdighed."
 20.  Men i et stort Hus er der ikke alene Kar af Guld og Sølv, men
      også af Træ og Ler, og nogle til Ære, andre til Vanære.
 21.  Dersom da nogen holder sig ren fra disse, han skal være et Kar
      til Ære, helliget, Husbonden nyttigt, tilberedt til al god
      Gerning.

 22.  Men fly de ungdommelige Begæringer; jag derimod efter
      Retfærdighed, Troskab, Kærlighed og Fred sammen med dem, som
      påkalde Herren af et rent Hjerte;
 23.  og afvis de tåbelige og uforstandige Stridigheder, efterdi du
      ved, at de avle Kampe,
 24.  men en Herrens Tjener bør ikke strides, men være mild imod alle,
      dygtig til at lære, i Stand til at tåle ondt,
 25.  med Sagtmodighed irettesættende dem, som modsætte sig, om Gud
      dog engang vilde give dem Omvendelse til Sandheds Erkendelse,
 26.  og de kunde blive ædru igen fra Djævelens Snare, af hvem de ere
      fangne til at gøre hans Villie.

2.Timoteus 3

  1.  Men vid dette,at i de sidste Dage skulle vanskelige Tider
      indtræde.
  2.  Thi Menneskene skulle være egenkærlige, pengegridske,
      praleriske, hovmodige, spottelystne, ulydige imod Forældre,
      utaknemmelige, ryggesløse,
  3.  ukærlige, uforligelige, bagtaleriske, uafholdne, rå, uden
      Kærlighed til det gode,
  4.  forræderske, fremfusende, opblæste, Mennesker, som mere elske
      Vellyst, end de elske Gud,
  5.  som have Gudfrygtigheds Skin, men have fornægtet dens Kraft. Og
      fra disse skal du vende dig bort!
  6.  Thi til dem høre de, som snige sig ind i Husene og fange
      Kvindfolk, der ere belæssede med Synder og drives af mange Hånde
      Begæringer
  7.  og altid lære og aldrig kunne komme til Sandheds Erkendelse.
  8.  Men ligesom Jannes og Jambres stode Moses imod, således modstå
      også disse Sandheden: Mennesker, fordærvede i Sindet,
      forkastelige i Troen.
  9.  Dog, de skulle ikke få Fremgang ydermere; thi deres Afsind skal
      blive åbenbart for alle, ligesom også hines blev.

 10.  Du derimod har efterfulgt mig i Lære, i Vandel, i Forsæt, Tro,
      Langmodighed, Kærlighed, Udholdenhed,
 11.  i Forfølgelser, i Lidelser, sådanne, som ere komne over mig i
      Antiokia, i Ikonium, i Lystra, sådanne Forfølgelser, som jeg har
      udstået, og Herren har friet mig ud af dem alle.
 12.  Ja, også alle de, som ville leve gudfrygtigt i Kristus Jesus,
      skulle forfølges.
 13.  Men onde Mennesker og Bedragere ville gå frem til det værre; de
      forføre og forføres.

 14.  Du derimod, bliv i det, som du har lært, og som du er bleven
      forvisset om, efterdi du ved, af hvem du har lært det,
 15.  og efterdi du fra Barn af kender de hellige Skrifter, som kunne
      gøre dig viis til Frelse ved Troen på Kristus Jesus.
 16.  Hvert Skrift er indåndet af Gud og nyttig til Belæring, til
      Irettesættelse, til Forbedring, til Optugtelse i Retfærdighed,
 17.  for at Guds-Mennesket må vorde fuldkomment, dygtiggjort til al
      god Gerning.

2.Timoteus 4

  1.  Jeg besværger dig for Guds og Kristi Jesu Åsyn, som skal dømme
      levende og døde, og ved hans Åbenbarelse og hans Rige:
  2.  Prædike Ordet, vær rede i Tide og i Utide, irettesæt, straf,
      forman med al Langmodighed og Belæring!
  3.  Thi den Tid skal komme, da de ikke skulle fordrage den sunde
      Lære, men efter deres egne Begæringer tage sig selv Lærere i
      Hobetal, efter hvad der kildrer deres Øren,
  4.  og de skulle vende Ørene fra Sandheden og vende sig hen til
      Fablerne.
  5.  Du derimod, vær ædru i alle Ting, lid ondt, gør en Evangelists
      Gerning, fuldbyrd din Tjeneste!

  6.  Thi jeg ofres allerede, og Tiden til mit Opbrud er for Hånden.
  7.  Jeg har stridt den gode Strid, fuldkommet Løbet og bevaret
      Troen.
  8.  I øvrigt henligger Retfærdighedens Krans til mig, hvilken
      Herren, den retfærdige Dommer, skal give mig på hin Dag, og ikke
      alene mig, men også alle dem, som have elsket hans Åbenbarelse.

  9.  Gør dig Flid for at komme snart til mig;
 10.  thi Demas forlod mig, fordi han fik Kærlighed til den nærværende
      Verden, og drog til Thessalonika; Kreskens drog til Galatien,
      Titus til Dalmatien.
 11.  Lukas er alene hos mig. Tag Markus og bring ham med dig; thi han
      er mig nyttig til Tjenesten.
 12.  Men Tykikus har jeg sendt til Efesus.
 13.  Når du kommer, da bring min Rejsekjortel med dig, som jeg lod
      blive i Troas hos Karpus, og Bøgerne, især dem på Pergament.

 14.  Smeden Aleksander har gjort mig meget ondt; Herren vil betale
      ham efter hans Gerninger.
 15.  For ham skal også du vogte dig; thi han stod vore Ord hårdt imod.
 16.  Ved mit første Forsvar kom ingen mig til Hjælp, men alle lode
      mig i Stikken; (gid det ikke må tilregnes dem! )
 17.  Men Herren stod hos mig og styrkede mig, for at Ordets Prædiken
      skulde fuldbyrdes ved mig, og alle Hedningerne høre det; og jeg
      blev friet fra Løvens Gab.
 18.  Herren vil fri mig fra al ond Gerning og frelse mig til sit
      himmelske Rige; ham være Æren i Evighedernes Evigheder! Amen.

 19.  Hils Priska og Akvila og Onesiforus's Hus!
 20.  Erastus blev i Korinth, men Trofimmus efterlod jeg syg i Milet.
 21.  Gør dig Flid for at komme før Vinteren! Eubulus og Pudens og
      Linus og Klaudia og alle Brødrene hilse dig.
 22.  Den Herre Jesus være med din Ånd! Nåden være med eder!


Titus

Titus 1

  1.  Paulus, Guds Tjener og Jesu Kristi Apostel til at virke Tro hos
      Guds udvalgte og Erkendelse at Sandheden angående Gudsfrygt,
  2.  i Håb om evigt Liv, hvilket Gud, som ikke lyver, har forjættet
      fra evige Tider,
  3.  men i sin Tid har han åbenbaret sit Ord ved den Prædiken, som er
      bleven mig betroet efter Guds, vor Frelsers Befaling:
  4.  til Titus, mit ægte Barn i fælles Tro: Nåde og Fred fra Gud
      Fader og Kristus Jesus vor Frelser!

  5.  Derfor efterlod jeg dig på Kreta, for at du skulde bringe i
      Orden, hvad der stod tilbage, og indsætte Ældste i hver By, som
      jeg pålagde dig,
  6.  såfremt en er ustraffelig, een Kvindes Mand og har troende Børn,
      der ikke ere beskyldte for Ryggesløshed eller ere genstridige.
  7.  Thi en Tilsynsmand bør være ustraffelig som en Guds Husholder,
      ikke selvbehagelig, ikke vredagtig, ikke hengiven til Vin, ikke
      til Slagsmål, ikke til slet Vinding,
  8.  men gæstfri, elskende det gode, sindig, retfærdig, from,
      afholdende;
  9.  en Mand, som holder fast ved det troværdige Ord efter Læren, for
      at han kan være dygtig til både at formane ved den sunde Lære og
      at gendrive dem, som sige imod.

 10.  Thi mange ere genstridige, føre intetsigende Snak og dåre
      Sindet, især de af Omskærelsen;
 11.  dem bør man stoppe Munden på; thi de forvende hele Huse ved at
      føre utilbørlig Lære for slet Vindings Skyld.
 12.  En af dem, en af deres egne Profeter, har sagt: "Kretere ere
      altid Løgnere, onde Dyr, lade Buge."
 13.  Dette Vidnesbyrd er sandt. Derfor skal du sætte dem strengelig i
      Rette, for at de må blive sunde i Troen
 14.  og ikke agte på jødiske Fabler og Bud af Mennesker, som vende
      sig bort fra Sandheden.
 15.  Alt er rent for de rene; men for de besmittede og vantro er
      intet rent, men både deres Sind og Samvittighed er besmittet.
 16.  De sige, at de kende Gud, men med deres Gerninger fornægte de
      ham, vederstyggelige, som de ere, og ulydige og uduelige til al
      god Gerning.

Titus 2

  1.  Du derimod, tal, hvad der sømmer sig for den sunde Lære:
  2.  at gamle Mænd skulle være ædruelige, ærbare, sindige, sunde i
      Troen, i Kærligheden, i Udholdenheden;
  3.  at gamle Kvinder ligeledes skulle skikke sig, som det sømmer sig
      hellige, ikke bagtale, ikke være forfaldne til megen Vin, men
      være Lærere i, hvad godt er,
  4.  for at de må få de unge Kvinder til at besinde sig på at elske
      deres Mænd og at elske deres Børn,
  5.  at være sindige, kyske, huslige, gode, deres egne Mænd
      undergivne, for at Guds Ord ikke skal bespottes.
  6.  Forman ligeledes de unge Mænd til at være sindige,
  7.  idet du i alle Måder viser dig selv som et Forbillede på gode
      Gerninger og i Læren viser Ufordærvethed, Ærbarhed,
  8.  sund, ulastelig Tale, for at Modstanderen må blive til Skamme,
      når han intet ondt har at sige om os.
  9.  Forman Trælle til at underordne sig under deres egne Herrer, at
      være dem til Behag i alle Ting, ikke sige imod,
 10.  ikke besvige, men vise al god Troskab, for at de i alle Måder
      kunne være en Pryd for Guds, vor Frelsers Lære.

 11.  Thi Guds Nåde er bleven åbenbaret til Frelse for alle Mennesker
 12.  og opdrager os til at forsage Ugudeligheden og de verdslige
      Begæringer og leve sindigt og retfærdigt og gudfrygtigt i den
      nærværende Verden;
 13.  forventende det salige Håb og den store Guds og vor Frelsers
      Jesu Kristi Herligheds Åbenbarelse,
 14.  han, som gav sig selv for os, for at han måtte forløse os fra al
      Lovløshed og rense sig selv et Ejendomsfolk, nidkært til gode
      Gerninger.
 15.  Tal dette, og forman og irettesæt med al Myndighed; lad ingen
      ringeagte dig!

Titus 3

  1.  Påmind dem om at underordne sig Øvrigheder og Myndigheder, at
      adlyde, at være redebonne til al god Gerning.
  2.  ikke at forhåne nogen, ikke være stridslystne, men milde, og
      udvise al Sagtmodighed imod alle Mennesker.

  3.  Thi også vi vare fordum uforstandige, ulydige, vildfarende,
      Slaver af Begæringer og, mange Hånde Lyster, vi levede i Ondskab
      og Avind, vare forhadte og hadede hverandre.
  4.  Men da Guds, vor Frelsers Godhed og Menneskekærlighed
      åbenbaredes,
  5.  frelste han os, ikke for de Retfærdigheds Gerningers Skyld, som
      vi havde gjort, men efter sin Barmhjertighed, ved Igenfødelsens
      Bad og Fornyelsen i den Helligånd,
  6.  som han rigeligt udøste over os ved Jesus Kristus, vor Frelser,
  7.  for at vi, retfærdiggjorte ved hans Nåde, skulde i Håb vorde
      Arvinger til evigt Liv.
  8.  Den Tale er troværdig, og derom vil jeg, at du skal forsikre
      dem, for at de, som ere komne til Tro på Gud, skulle lægge Vind
      på at øve gode Gerninger. Dette er Menneskene godt og nyttigt.

  9.  Men hold dig fra tåbelige Stridigheder og Slægtregistre og Kiv
      og Kampe om Loven; thi de ere unyttige og frugtesløse.
 10.  Et kættersk Menneske skal du afvise efter een og to Ganges
      Påmindelse,
 11.  da du ved, at en sådan er forvendt og synder, domfældt af sig
      selv.

 12.  Når jeg sender Artemas til dig eller Tykikus, da gør dig Flid
      for at komme til mig i Nikopolis;thi der har jeg besluttet at
      overvintre.
 13.  Zenas den lovkyndige og Apollos skal du omhyggeligt hjælpe på
      Vej, for at intet skal fattes dem.
 14.  Men lad også vore lære at øve gode Gerninger, hvor der er Trang
      dertil, for at de ikke skulle være uden Frugt.
 15.  Alle, som ere hos mig, hilse dig. Hils dem, som elske os i
      Troen.  Nåden være med eder alle!


Filemon 1

  1.  Paulus, Kristi Jesu Fange, og Broderen Timotheus til Filemon,
      vor elskede og Medarbejder,
  2.  og til Søsteren Appia og Arkippus, vor Medstrider, og Menigheden
      i dit Hus;
  3.  Nåde være med eder og Fred fra Gud vor Fader og den Herre Jesus
      Kristus!

  4.  Jeg takker min Gud altid, når jeg kommer dig i Hu i mine Bønner,
  5.  efterdi jeg hører om din Kærlighed og den Tro, som du har til
      den Herre Jesus og til alle de hellige,
  6.  for at din Delagtighed i Troen må blive virksom for Kristus i
      Erkendelse af alt det gode, som er i eder.
  7.  Thi stor Glæde og Trøst har jeg fået af din Kærlighed, efterdi
      de helliges Hjerter ere blevne vederkvægede ved dig, Broder!

  8.  Derfor, endskønt jeg kunde med stor Frimodighed i Kristus befale
      dig det, som er tilbørligt,
  9.  så beder jeg dig dog hellere for Kærlighedens Skyld, sådan som
      jeg er, som den gamle Paulus, og nu tilmed Kristi Jesu Fange;
 10.  jeg beder dig for mit Barn, som jeg har avlet i mine Lænker,
      Onesimus,
 11.  ham, som tilforn var dig unyttig, men nu er nyttig både for dig
      og for mig, ham, som jeg sender dig tilbage,
 12.  ham, det er mit eget Hjerte.
 13.  Ham vilde jeg gerne beholde hos mig, for at han i dit Sted kunde
      tjene mig i Evangeliets Lænker.
 14.  Men, uden dit Samtykke vilde jeg intet gøre, for at din Godhed
      ikke skulde være som af Tvang, men af fri Villie.
 15.  Thi måske blev han derfor skilt fra dig en liden Tid, for at du
      kunde få ham igen til evigt Eje,
 16.  ikke mere som en Træl, men som mere end en Træl, som en elsket
      Broder, særlig for mig, men hvor meget mere for dig, både i
      Kødet og i Herren.
 17.  Dersom da du anser mig for din Medbroder, så modtag ham som mig!
 18.  Men har han gjort dig nogen Uret eller er dig noget skyldig, da
      før mig det til Regning!
 19.  Jeg, Paulus, skriver med min egen Hånd, jeg vil betale,for ikke
      at sige dig, at du desuden også skylder mig dig selv.
 20.  Ja, Broder! lad mig få Gavn af dig i Herren, vederkvæg mit
      Hjerte i Kristus!

 21.  I Tillid til din Lydighed skriver jeg til dig, idet jeg ved, at
      du vil gøre endog mere end det, jeg siger.
 22.  Men med det samme bered også Herberge for mig; thi jeg håber, at
      jeg ved eders Bønner skal skænkes eder.
 23.  Epafras, min medfangne i Kristus Jesus,
 24.  Markus, Aristarkus, Demas, Lukas, mine Medarbejdere, hilse dig.
 25.  Vor Herres Jesu Kristi Nåde være med eders Ånd!


Hebræerne

Hebræerne 1

  1.  Efter at Gud fordum havde talt mange Gange og på mange Måder,
      til Fædrene ved Profeterne, så har han ved Slutningen af disse
      Dage talt til os ved sin Søn,
  2.  hvem han har sat til Arving af alle Ting, ved hvem han også har
      skabt Verden;
  3.  han, som - efterdi han er hans Herligheds Glans og hans Væsens
      udtrykte Billede og bærer alle Ting med sin Krafts Ord - efter
      at have gjort Renselse fra Synderne har sat sig ved Majestætens
      højre Hånd i det høje,
  4.  idet han er bleven så meget ypperligere end Englene, som han har
      arvet et herligere Navn fremfor dem.

  5.  Thi til hvilken af Englene sagde han nogen Sinde: "Du er min
      Søn, jeg har født dig i Dag"? og fremdeles: "Jeg skal være ham
      en Fader, og han skal være mig en Søn"?
  6.  Og når han atter indfører den førstefødte i Verden, hedder det:
      "Og alle Guds Engle skulle tilbede ham".
  7.  Og om Englene hedder det: "Han gør sine Engle til Vinde og sine
      Tjenere til Ildslue";
  8.  men om Sønnen,: "Din Trone, o Gud! står i al Evighed, og Rettens
      Kongestav er dit Riges Kongestav.
  9.  Du elskede Retfærdighed og hadede Lovløshed, derfor har Gud, din
      Gud, salvet dig med Glædens Olie fremfor dine Medbrødre".
 10.  Og: "Du, Herre! har i Begyndelsen grundfæstet Jorden, og Himlene
      ere dine Hænders Gerninger.
 11.  De skulle forgå, men du bliver; og de skulle til Hobe ældes som
      et Klædebon,
 12.  ja, som et Klæde skal du sammenrulle dem, og de skulle
      omskiftes; men du er den samme, og dine År skulle ikke få Ende".
 13.  Men til hvilken af Englene sagde han nogen Sinde: "Sæt dig ved
      min højre Hånd, indtil jeg får lagt dine Fjender som en Skammel
      for dine Fødder"?
 14.  Ere de ikke alle tjenende Ånder, som udsendes til Hjælp for
      deres Skyld, der skulle arve Frelse?

Hebræerne 2

  1.  Derfor bør vi des mere agte på det, vi have hørt, for at vi ikke
      skulle rives bort.
  2.  Thi når det Ord, som taltes ved Engle, blev urokket, og hver
      Overtrædelse og Ulydighed f1k velforskyldt Løn,
  3.  hvorledes skulle da vi undfly, når vi ikke bryde os om så stor
      en Frelse, som jo efter først at være bleven forkyndt ved
      Herren, er bleven stadfæstet for os af dem, som havde hørt ham,
  4.  idet Gud vidnede med både ved Tegn og Undere og mange Hånde
      kraftige Gerninger og ved Meddelelse af den Helligånd efter sin
      Villie.

  5.  Thi det var ikke Engle, han underlagde den kommende Verden; om
      hvilken vi tale.
  6.  Men en har vidnet et Sted og sagt: "Hvad er et Menneske, at du
      kommer ham i Hu? eller en Menneskesøn, at du ser til ham?
  7.  Du gjorde ham en kort Tid ringere end Engle; med Herlighed og
      Ære kronede du ham;
  8.  alle Ting lagde du under hans Fødder". - Idet han nemlig
      underlagde ham alle Ting, undtog han intet fra at være ham
      underlagt. Nu se vi imidlertid endnu ikke alle Ting underlagte
      ham;
  9.  men ham, som en kort Tid var bleven gjort ringere end Engle,
      Jesus, se vi på Grund af Dødens Lidelse kronet med Herlighed og
      Ære, for at han ved Guds Nåde må have smagt Døden for alle.

 10.  Thi det sømmede sig ham, for hvis Skyld alle Ting ere, og ved
      hvem alle Ting ere, når han førte mange Sønner til Herlighed, da
      at fuldkomme deres Frelses Ophavsmand igennem Lidelser.
 11.  Thi både den, som helliger, og de, som helliges, ere alle af
      een; hvorfor han ikke skammer sig ved at kalde dem Brødre,
 12.  når han siger: "Jeg vil forkynde dit Navn for mine Brødre, midt
      i en Menighed vil jeg lovsynge dig."
 13.  Og fremdeles: "Jeg vil forlade mig på ham." Og fremdeles: "Se,
      her er jeg og de Børn, som Gud har givet mig."
 14.  Efterdi da Børnene ere delagtige i Blod og Kød, blev også han i
      lige Måde delagtig deri, for at han ved Døden skulde gøre den
      magtesløs, som har Dødens Vælde, det er Djævelen,
 15.  og befri alle dem, som på Grund af Dødsfrygt vare under Trældom
      al deres Livs Tid.
 16.  Thi det er jo dog ikke Engle, han tager sig af, men Abrahams Sæd
      tager han sig af.
 17.  Derfor måtte han blive sine Brødre lig i alle. Ting, for at han
      kunde blive en barmhjertig og trofast Ypperstepræst over for Gud
      til at sone Folkets Synder.
 18.  Thi idet han har lidt, kan han som den, der selv er fristet,
      komme dem til Hjælp, som fristes.

Hebræerne 3

  1.  Derfor, hellige Brødre, delagtige i en himmelsk Kaldelse! ser
      hen til vor Bekendelses Udsending og Ypperstepræst, Jesus,
  2.  der var tro imod den, som beskikkede ham, ligesom også Moses var
      det i hele hans Hus.
  3.  Thi han er kendt værdig til større Herlighed end Moses, i samme
      Mål som den,der har indrettet et Hus, har større Ære end Huset
      selv.
  4.  Thi hvert Hus indrettes af nogen; men den, som har indrettet
      alt, er Gud.
  5.  Og Moses var vel tro i hele hans Hus, som en Tjener, til
      Vidnesbyrd om, hvad der skulde tales;
  6.  men Kristus er det som en Søn over hans Hus; og hans Hus ere vi,
      såfremt vi fastholde Håbets Frimodighed og Ros urokket indtil
      Enden.

  7.  Derfor, som den Helligånd siger: "I Dag, når I høre hans Røst,
  8.  da forhærder ikke eders Hjerter, som det skete i Forbitrelsen,
      på Fristelsens Dag i Ørkenen,
  9.  hvor eders Fædre fristede mig ved at sætte mig på Prøve, og de
      så dog mine Gerninger i fyrretyve År.
 10.  Derfor harmedes jeg på denne Slægt og sagde: De fare altid vild
      i Hjertet; men de kendte ikke mine Veje,
 11.  så jeg svor i min Vrede: Sandelig, de skulle ikke gå ind til min
      Hvile" -
 12.  så ser til, Brødre! at der ikke nogen Sinde i nogen af eder skal
      findes et ondt, vantro Hjerte, så at han falder fra den levende
      Gud.
 13.  Men formaner hverandre hver Dag, så længe det hedder "i Dag",
      for at ikke nogen af eder skal forhærdes ved Syndens Bedrag.
 14.  Thi vi ere blevne delagtige i Kristus, såfremt vi fastholde vor
      første Fortrøstning urokket indtil Enden.
 15.  Når der sigs: "I Dag, - når I høre hans Røst, da forhærder ikke
      eders Hjerter som i Forbitrelsen":
 16.  hvem vare da vel de, som hørte og dog voldte Forbitrelse? Mon
      ikke alle, som gik ud af Ægypten ved Moses?
 17.  Men på hvem harmedes han i fyrretyve År? Mon ikke på dem, som
      syndede, hvis døde Kroppe faldt i Ørkenen?
 18.  Og over for hvem tilsvor han, at de ikke skulde gå ind til hans
      Hvile, uden dem, som vare blevne genstridige?
 19.  Og vi se, at de ikke kunde gå ind på Grund af Vantro.

Hebræerne 4

  1.  Lader os derfor, da der endnu står en Forjættelse tilbage om at
      indgå til hans Hvile, vogte os for, at nogen af eder skal mene,
      at han er kommen for silde.
  2.  Thi også os er der forkyndt godt Budskab ligesom hine; men
      Ordet, som de hørte, hjalp ikke dem, fordi det ikke var forenet
      med Troen hos dem, som hørte det.
  3.  Thi vi gå ind til Hvilen, vi, som ere komne til Troen, efter
      hvad han har sagt: "Så svor jeg i min Vrede: Sandelig, de skulle
      ikke gå ind til min Hvile", omendskønt Gerningerne vare
      fuldbragte fra Verdens Grundlæggelse.
  4.  Thi han har et Sted sagt om den syvende Dag således: "Og Gud
      hvilede på den syvende Dag fra alle sine Gerninger."
  5.  Og fremdeles på dette Sted: "Sandelig, de skulle ikke gå ind til
      min Hvile."
  6.  Efterdi der altså står tilbage, at nogle skulle gå ind til den,
      og de, hvem der først blev forkyndt godt Budskab, ikke gik ind
      for deres Genstridigheds Skyld:
  7.  så bestemmer han atter en Dag: "I Dag", siger han ved David så
      lang Tid efter, (som ovenfor sagt): "I Dag, når I høre hans
      Røst, da forhærder ikke eders Hjerter!"
  8.  Thi dersom Josva havde skaffet dem Hvile, da vilde han ikke tale
      om en anden Dag siden efter.
  9.  Altså er der en Sabbatshvile tilbage for Guds Folk.
 10.  Thi den, som er gået ind til hans Hvile, også han har fået Hvile
      fra sine Gerninger, ligesom Gud fra sine.

 11.  Lader os derfor gøre os Flid for at gå ind til hin Hvile, for at
      ikke nogen skal falde ved den samme Genstridighed, som hine gave
      Eksempel på.
 12.  Thi Guds Ord er levende og kraftigt og skarpere end noget
      tveægget Sværd og trænger igennem, indtil det deler Sjæl og Ånd,
      Ledemod såvel som Marv, og dømmer over Hjertets Tanker og Råd.
 13.  Og ingen Skabning er usynlig for hans Åsyn; men alle Ting ere
      nøgne og udspændte for hans Øjne, hvem vi stå til Regnskab.

 14.  Efterdi vi altså have en stor Ypperstepræst, som er gået igennem
      Himlene, Jesus, Guds Søn, da lader os holde fast ved
      Bekendelsen!
 15.  Thi vi have ikke en Ypperstepræst, som ej kan have Medlidenhed
      med vore Skrøbeligheder, men en sådan, som er fristet i alle
      Ting i Lighed med os, dog uden Synd.
 16.  Derfor lader os træde frem med Frimodighed for Nådens Trone, for
      at vi kunne få Barmhjertighed og finde Nåde til betimelig Hjælp.

Hebræerne 5

  1.  Thi hver Ypperstepræst tages iblandt Mennesker og indsættes for
      Mennesker til Tjenesten for Gud, for at han skal frembære både
      Gaver og Slagtofre for Synder,
  2.  som en, der kan bære over med de vankundige og vildfarende,
      eftersom han også selv er stedt i Skrøbelighed
  3.  og for dens Skyld må frembære Syndoffer, som for Folket således
      også for sig selv
  4.  Og ingen tager sig selv den Ære, men han kaldes af Gud, ligesom
      jo også Aron.

  5.  Således har ej heller Kristus tillagt sig selv den Ære at blive
      Ypperstepræst, men den, som sagde til ham: "Du er min Søn, jeg
      har født dig i Dag,"
  6.  som han jo også siger et andet Sted: "Du er Præst til evig Tid,
      efter Melkisedeks Vis,"
  7.  han, som i sit Køds Dage med stærkt Råb og Tårer frembar Bønner
      og ydmyge Begæringer til den, der kunde frelse ham fra Døden, og
      blev bønhørt i sin Angst,
  8.  og således, endskønt han var Søn, lærte Lydighed af det, han
      led,
  9.  og efter at være fuldkommet blev Årsag til evig Frelse for alle
      dem, som lyde ham,
 10.  idet han af Gud blev kaldt Ypperstepræst efter Melkisedeks Vis.

 11.  Herom have vi meget at sige, og det er vanskeligt at forklare,
      efterdi I ere blevne sløve til at høre.
 12.  Thi skønt I efter Tiden endog burde være Lærere, trænge I atter
      til, at man skal lære eder Begyndelsesgrundene i Guds Ord, og I
      ere blevne sådanne, som trænge til Mælk og ikke til fast Føde.
 13.  Thi hver, som får Mælk, er ukyndig i den rette Tale, thi han er
      spæd;
 14.  men for de fuldkomne er den faste Føde, for dem, som på Grund af
      deres Erfaring have Sanserne øvede til at skelne mellem godt og
      ondt.

Hebræerne 6

  1.  Lader os derfor forbigå Begyndelsesordet om Kristus og skride
      frem til Fuldkommenhed uden atter at lægge Grundvold med
      Omvendelse fra døde Gerninger og med Tro på Gud,
  2.  med Lære om Døbelser og Håndspålæggelse og dødes Opstandelse og
      evig Dom.
  3.  Ja, dette ville vi gøre, såfremt Gud tilsteder det.
  4.  Thi dem, som een Gang ere blevne oplyste og have smagt den
      himmelske Gave og ere blevne delagtige i den Helligånd
  5.  og have smagt Guds gode Ord og den kommende Verdens Kræfter, og
      som ere faldne fra, - dem er det umuligt atter at forny til
      Omvendelse
  6.  da de igen korsfæste sig Guds Søn og stille ham til Spot.
  7.  Thi Jorden, som drikker den ofte derpå faldende Regn og
      frembringer Vækster, tjenlige for dem, for hvis Skyld den også
      dyrkes, får Velsignelse fra Gud;
  8.  men når den bærer Torne og Tidsler, er den ubrugbar og
      Forbandelse nær; Enden med den er at brændes.

  9.  Dog, i Henseende til eder, I elskede! ere vi overbeviste om det
      bedre og det, som bringer Frelse, selv om vi tale således.
 10.  Thi Gud er ikke uretfærdig, så at han skulde glemme eders
      Gerning og den Kærlighed, som I have udvist imod hans Navn, idet
      I have tjent og tjene de hellige.
 11.  Men vi ønske, at enhver af eder må udvise den samme Iver efter
      den fulde Vished i Håbet indtil Enden,
 12.  for at I ikke skulle blive sløve, men efterfølge dem, som ved
      Tro og Tålmodighed arve Forjættelserne.
 13.  Thi da Gud gav Abraham Forjættelsen, svor han ved sig selv,
      fordi han ingen større havde at sværge ved, og sagde:
 14.  "Sandelig, jeg vil rigeligt velsigne dig og rigeligt
      mangfoldiggøre dig."
 15.  Og således opnåede han Forjættelsen ved at vente tålmodigt.
 16.  Mennesker sværge jo ved en større, og Eden er dem en Ende på al
      Modsigelse til Stadfæstelse.
 17.  Derfor, da Gud ydermere vilde vise Forjættelsens Arvinger sit
      Råds Uforanderlighed, føjede han en Ed dertil,
 18.  for at vi ved to uforanderlige Ting, i hvilke det var umuligt,
      at Gud kunde lyve, skulde have en kraftig Opmuntring, vi, som
      ere flyede hen for at holde fast ved det Håb, som ligger foran
      os,
 19.  hvilket vi have som et Sjælens Anker, der er sikkert og fast og
      går ind inden for Forhænget,
 20.  hvor Jesus som Forløber gik ind for os, idet han efter
      Melkisedeks Vis blev Ypperstepræst til evig Tid.

Hebræerne 7

  1.  Thi denne Melkisedek, Konge i Salem, den højeste Guds Præst, som
      gik Abraham i Møde, da han vendte tilbage fra Kongernes
      Nederlag, og velsignede ham,
  2.  hvem også Abraham gav Tiende af alt, og som, når hans Navn
      udlægges, først er Retfærdigheds Konge, dernæst også Salems
      Konge, det er: Freds Konge,
  3.  uden Fader, uden Moder, uden Slægtregister, uden Dages
      Begyndelse og uden Livs Ende, men gjort lig med Guds Søn, - han
      forbliver Præst for bestandig.

  4.  Ser dog, hvor stor denne er, hvem endog Patriarken Abraham gav
      Tiende af Byttet.
  5.  Og hine, som, idet de høre til Levi Sønner, få Præstedømmet,
      have et Bud om at tage Tiende efter Loven af Folket, det er af
      deres Brødre, endskønt disse ere udgåede af Abrahams Lænd;
  6.  men han, som ikke regner sin Slægt fra dem, har taget Tiende af
      Abraham og har velsignet den, som havde Forjættelserne.
  7.  Men uden al Modsigelse er det den ringere, som velsignes af den
      ypperligere.
  8.  Og her er det dødelige Mennesker, som tager Tiende; men der er
      det en, om hvem der vidnes, at han lever.
  9.  Ja, så at sige, har endog Levi, som tager Tiende, igennem
      Abraham givet Tiende;
 10.  thi han var endnu i Faderens Lænd, da Melkisedek gik denne i
      Møde.

 11.  Hvis der altså var Fuldkommelse at få ved det levitiske
      Præstedømme (thi på Grundlag af dette har jo Folket fået Loven),
      hvilken Trang var der da yderligere til, at en anden Slags Præst
      skulde opstå efter Melkisedeks Vis og ikke nævnes efter Arons
      Vis?
 12.  Når nemlig Præstedømmet omskiftes, sker der med Nødvendighed
      også en Omskiftelse af Loven.
 13.  Thi han, om hvem dette siges, har hørt til en anden Stamme, af
      hvilken ingen har taget Vare på Alteret.
 14.  thi det er vitterligt, at af Juda er vor Herre oprunden, og for
      den Stammes Vedkommende har Moses intet talt om Præster.
 15.  Og det bliver end ydermere klart, når der i Lighed med
      Melkisedek opstår en anden Slags Præst,
 16.  som ikke er bleven det efter et kødeligt Buds Lov, men efter et
      uopløseligt Livs Kraft.
 17.  Thi han får det Vidnesbyrd: "Du er Præst til evig Tid efter
      Melkisedeks Vis."
 18.  Thi vel sker der Ophævelse af et forudgående Bud, fordi det var
      svagt og unyttigt
 19.  (thi Loven har ikke fuldkommet noget); men der sker Indførelse
      af et bedre Håb, ved hvilket vi nærme os til Gud.
 20.  Og så vist som det ikke er sket uden Ed,
 21.  (thi hine ere blevne Præster uden Ed, men denne med Ed, ved den,
      som siger til ham: "Herren svor, og han skal ikke angre det: Du
      er Præst til evig Tid"):
 22.  så vist er Jesus bleven Borgen for en bedre Pagt.
 23.  Og hine ere blevne Præster, flere efter hinanden, fordi de ved
      Døden hindredes i at vedblive;
 24.  men denne har et uforgængeligt Præstedømme, fordi han bliver til
      evig Tid,
 25.  hvorfor han også kan fuldkomment frelse dem, som komme til Gud
      ved ham, efterdi han lever altid til at gå i Forbøn for dem.

 26.  Thi en sådan Ypperstepræst var det også, som sømmede sig for os,
      en from, uskyldig, ubesmittet, adskilt fra Syndere og ophøjet
      over Himlene;
 27.  en, som ikke hver Dag har nødig, som Ypperstepræsterne, at
      frembære Ofre først for sine egne Synder, derefter for Folkets;
      thi dette gjorde han een Gang for alle, da han ofrede sig selv.
 28.  Thi Loven indsætter til Ypperstepræster Mennesker, som have
      Skrøbelighed; men Edens Ord, som kom senere end Loven, indsætter
      en Søn, som er fuldkommet til evig Tid:

Hebræerne 8

  1.  Men Hovedpunktet ved det, hvorom her tales, er dette: vi have en
      sådan Ypperstepræst, der har taget Sæde på højre Side af
      Majestætens Trone i Himlene
  2.  som Tjener ved Helligdommen og det sande Tabernakel, hvilket
      Herren har oprejst, og ikke et Menneske.
  3.  Thi hver Ypperstepræst indsættes til at frembære Gaver og
      Slagtofre; derfor er det nødvendigt, at også denne må have noget
      at frembære.
  4.  Dersom han nu var på Jorden, da var han ikke engang Præst,
      efterdi der her er dem, som frembære Gaverne efter Loven;
  5.  hvilke jo tjene ved en Afbildning og Skygge af det himmelske,
      således som det blev Moses betydet af Gud, da han skulde
      indrette Tabernaklet: "Se til, sagde han, at du gør alting efter
      det Forbillede, der blev vist dig på Bjerget."

  6.  Men nu har han fået en så meget ypperligere Tjeneste, som han
      også er Mellemmand for en bedre Pagt, der jo er grundet på bedre
      Forjættelser.
  7.  Thi dersom hin første var udadlelig, da vilde der ikke blive
      søgt Sted for en anden.
  8.  Thi dadlende siger han til dem: "Se, der kommer Dage, siger
      Herren, da jeg vil slutte en ny Pagt med Israels Hus og med
      Judas Hus;
  9.  ikke som den Pagt, jeg gjorde med deres Fædre på den Dag, da jeg
      tog dem ved Hånden for at føre dem ud af Ægyptens Land; thi de
      bleve ikke i min Pagt, og jeg brød mig ikke om dem, siger
      Herren.
 10.  Thi dette er den Pagt, som jeg vil oprette med Israels Hus efter
      de Dage, siger Herren: Jeg vil give mine Love i deres Sind, og
      jeg vil indskrive dem i deres Hjerte, og jeg vil være deres Gud,
      og de skulle være mit Folk.
 11.  Og de skulle ikke lære hver sin Medborger og hver sin Broder og
      sige: Kend Herren; thi de skulle alle kende mig, fra den mindste
      indtil den største iblandt dem.
 12.  Thi jeg vil være nådig imod deres Uretfærdigheder og ikke mere
      ihukomme deres Synder."
 13.  Når han siger: "en ny", har han erklæret den første for gammel;
      men det, som bliver gammelt og ældes, er nu ved at forsvinde.

Hebræerne 9

  1.  Vel havde også den første Pagt Forskrifter for Gudstjenesten og
      en jordisk Helligdom.
  2.  Thi der var indrettet et Telt, det forreste, hvori Lysestagen
      var og Bordet og Skuebrødene, det, som jo kaldes det Hellige.
  3.  Men bag det andet Forhæng var et Telt, det, som kaldes det
      Allerhelligste,
  4.  som havde et gyldent Røgelsealter og Pagtens Ark, overalt
      beklædt med Guld, i hvilken der var en Guldkrukke med Mannaen,
      og Arons Stav, som havde blomstret, og Pagtens Tavler,
  5.  men oven over den var Herlighedens Keruber, som overskyggede
      Nådestolen, hvorom der nu ikke skal tales enkeltvis.
  6.  Idet nu dette er således indrettet, gå Præsterne til Stadighed
      ind i det forreste Telt, når de forrette Tjenesten;
  7.  men i det andet går alene Ypperstepræsten ind een Gang om Året,
      ikke uden Blod,hvilket han ofrer for sig selv og Folkets
      Forseelser,
  8.  hvorved den Helligånd giver til Kende, at Vejen til Helligdommen
      endnu ikke er bleven åbenbar, så længe det førreste Telt endnu
      står,
  9.  hvilket jo er et Sindbillede indtil den nærværende Tid, og
      stemmende hermed frembæres der både Gaver og Ofre, som ikke i
      Henseende til Samvittigheden kunne fuldkomme den, der forretter
      sin Gudsdyrkelse,
 10.  men som kun, ved Siden af Mad og Drikke og forskellige
      Tvættelser, ere kødelige Forskrifter, pålagte indtil den rette
      Ordnings Tid.

 11.  Men da Kristus kom som Ypperstepræst for de kommende Goder, gik
      han igennem det større og fuldkomnere Telt, som ikke er gjort
      med Hænder, det er: som ikke er af denne Skabning,
 12.  og gik ikke heller med Blod af Bukke eller Kalve, men med sit
      eget Blod een Gang for alle ind i Helligdommen og vandt en evig
      Forløsning.
 13.  Thi dersom Blodet af Bukke og Tyre og Aske af en Kvie ved at
      stænkes på de besmittede helliger til Kødets Renhed:
 14.  hvor meget mere skal da Kristi Blod, hans, som ved en evig Ånd
      frembar sig selv lydeløs for Gud, rense eders Samvittighed fra
      døde Gerninger til at tjene den levende Gud?

 15.  Og derfor er han Mellemmand for en ny Pagt, for at de kaldede,
      da der har fundet Død Sted til Genløsning fra Overtrædelserne
      under den første Pagt, må få den evige Arvs Forjættelse.
 16.  Thi hvor der er en Arvepagt, der er det nødvendigt, at hans Død,
      som har oprettet Pagten, skal godtgøres.
 17.  Thi en Arvepagt er urokkelig efter døde, da den ingen Sinde
      træder i Kraft, medens den, som har oprettet den, lever.
 18.  Derfor er heller ikke den første bleven indviet uden Blod
 19.  Thi da hvert Bud efter Loven var forkyndt af Moses for hele
      Folket, tog han Kalve- og Bukkeblod med Vand og skarlagenrød Uld
      og Isop og bestænkede både Bogen selv og hele Folket, idet han
      sagde:
 20.  "Dette er den Pagts Blod, hvilken Gud har pålagt eder."
 21.  Og Tabernaklet og alle Tjenestens Redskaber bestænkede han
      ligeledes med Blodet.
 22.  Og næsten alt bliver efter Loven renset med Blod, og uden Blods
      Udgydelse sker der ikke Forladelse.

 23.  Altså var det en Nødvendighed, at Afbildningerne af de himmelske
      Ting skulde renses herved, men selve de himmelske Ting ved bedre
      Ofre end disse.
 24.  Thi Kristus gik ikke ind i en Helligdom, som var gjort med
      Hænder og kun var et Billede af den sande, men ind i selve
      Himmelen for nu at træde frem for Guds Ansigt til Bedste for os;
 25.  ikke heller for at han skulde ofre sig selv mange Gange, ligesom
      Ypperstepræsten hvert År går ind i Helligdommen med fremmed
      Blod;
 26.  ellers havde han måttet lide mange Gange fra Verdens
      Grundlæggelse; men nu er han een Gang for alle ved Tidernes
      Fuldendelse åbenbaret for at bortskaffe Synden ved sit Offer.
 27.  Og ligesom det er Menneskene beskikket at dø een Gang og
      derefter Dom,
 28.  således skal også Kristus, efter at være bleven een Gang ofret
      for at bære manges Synder, anden Gang, uden Synd, vise sig for
      dem, som foruente ham til Frelse.

Hebræerne 10

  1.  Thi da Loven kun har en Skygge af de kommende Goder og ikke
      Tingenes Skikkelse selv, kan den aldrig ved de samme årlige
      Ofre, som de bestandig frembære, fuldkomme dem, som træde frem
      dermed.
  2.  Vilde man ikke ellers have ophørt at frembære dem, fordi de
      ofrende ikke mere havde nogen Bevidsthed om Synder, når de een
      Gang vare rensede?
  3.  Men ved Ofrene sker År for År Ihukommelse af Synder.
  4.  Thi det er umuligt, at Blod af Tyre og Bukke kan borttage
      Synder.

  5.  Derfor siger han, idet han indtræder i Verden: "Slagtoffer og
      Madoffer havde du ikke Lyst til; men et Legeme beredte du mig;
  6.  Brændofre og Syndofre havde du ikke Behag i.
  7.  Da sagde jeg: Se, jeg er kommen (i Bogrullen er der skrevet om
      mig) for at gøre, Gud! din Villie."
  8.  Medens han først siger: "Slagtofre og Madofre og Brændofre og
      Syndofre havde du ikke Lyst til og ej heller Behag i" (og disse
      frembæres dog efter Loven),
  9.  så har han derefter sagt: "Se, jeg er kommen for at gøre din
      Villie." Han ophæver det første for at fastsætte det andet.
 10.  Og ved denne Villie ere vi helligede ved Ofringen af Jesu Kristi
      Legeme een Gang for alle.
 11.  Og hver Præst står daglig og tjener og ofrer mange Gange de
      samme Ofre, som dog aldrig kunne borttage Synder.
 12.  Men denne har efter at have ofret eet Offer for Synderne sat sig
      for bestandig ved Guds højre Hånd,
 13.  idet han for øvrigt venter på, at hans Fjender skulle lægges som
      en Skammel for hans Fødder.
 14.  Thi med et eneste Offer har han for bestandig fuldkommet dem,
      som helliges.
 15.  Men også den Helligånd giver os Vidnesbyrd; thi efter at have
      sagt:
 16.  "Dette er den Pagt, som jeg vil oprette med dem efter de Dage,"
      siger Herren: "Jeg vil give mine Love i deres Hjerter, og jeg
      vil indskrive dem i deres Sind,
 17.  og deres Synder og deres Overtrædelser vil jeg ikke mere
      ihukomme."
 18.  Men hvor der er Forladelse for disse, er der ikke mere Offer for
      Synd.

 19.  Efterdi vi da, Brødre! have Frimodighed til den Indgang i
      Helligdommen ved Jesu Blod,
 20.  som han indviede os som en ny og levende Vej igennem Forhænget,
      det er hans Kød,
 21.  og efterdi vi have en stor Præst over Guds Hus:
 22.  så lader os træde frem med et sandt Hjerte, i Troens fulde
      Forvisning, med Hjerterne ved Bestænkelsen rensede fra en ond
      Samvittighed, og Legemet tvættet med rent Vand;
 23.  lader os fastholde Håbets Bekendelse urokket; thi trofast er
      han, som gav Forjættelsen;
 24.  og lader os give Agt på hverandre, så vi opflamme hverandre til
      Kærlighed og gode Gerninger
 25.  og ikke forlade vor egen Forsamling, som nogle have for Skik,
      men formane hverandre, og det så meget mere, som I se, at Dagen
      nærmer sig.

 26.  Thi Synde vi med Villie, efter at have modtaget Sandhedens
      Erkendelse, er der intet Offer mere tilbage for Synder,
 27.  men en frygtelig Forventelse at Dom og en brændende Nidkærhed,
      som skal fortære de genstridige.
 28.  Når en har brudt med Mose Lov, dør han uden Barmhjertighed på to
      eller tre Vidners Udsagn;
 29.  hvor meget værre Straf mene I da, at den skal agtes værd, som
      træder Guds Søn under Fod og agter Pagtens Blod, hvormed han
      blev helliget, for urent og forhåner Nådens Ånd?
 30.  Thi vi kende den, som har sagt: "Mig hører Hævnen til, jeg vil
      betale, siger Herren;" og fremdeles: "Herren skal dømme sit
      Folk."
 31.  Det er frygteligt at falde i den levende Guds Hænder.

 32.  Men kommer de forrige Dage i Hu, i hvilke I, efter at I vare
      blevne oplyste, udholdt megen Kamp i Lidelser,
 33.  idet I dels selv ved Forhånelser og Trængsler bleve et Skuespil,
      dels gjorde fælles Sag med dem, som fristede sådanne Kår.
 34.  Thi både havde I Medlidenhed med de fangne, og I fandt eder med
      Glæde i, at man røvede, hvad I ejede, vidende, at I selv have en
      bedre og blivende Ejendom.
 35.  Kaster altså ikke eders Frimodighed bort, hvilken jo har stor
      Belønning;
 36.  thi I have Udholdenhed nødig, for at I, når I have gjort Guds
      Villie, kunne opnå Forjættelsen.
 37.  Thi "der er endnu kun en såre liden Stund, så kommer han, der
      skal komme, og han vil ikke tøve.
 38.  Men min retfærdige skal leve af Tro; og dersom han unddrager
      sig, har min Sjæl ikke Behag i ham."
 39.  Men vi ere ikke af dem, som unddrage sig, til Fortabelse, men af
      dem, som tro, til Sjælens Frelse,

Hebræerne 11

  1.  Men Tro er en Fortrøstning til det, som håbes, en Overbevisning
      om Ting, som ikke ses.
  2.  Ved den fik jo de gamle godt Vidnesbyrd.
  3.  Ved Tro fatte vi, at Verden er bleven skabt ved Guds Ord, så det
      ikke er af synlige Ting, at det, som ses, er blevet til.
  4.  Ved Tro ofrede Abel Gud et bedre Offer end Kain, og ved den fik
      han det Vidnesbyrd, at han var retfærdig, idet Gud bevidnede sit
      Velbehag i hans Gaver; og ved den taler han endnu efter sin Død.
  5.  Ved Tro blev Enok borttagen, for at han ikke skulde se Døden, og
      han blev ikke funden, efterdi Gud havde taget ham bort; thi før
      Borttagelsen har han fået det Vidnesbyrd, at han har behaget
      Gud.
  6.  Men uden Tro er det umuligt at behage ham; thi den, som kommer
      frem for Gud, bør tro, at han er til, og at han bliver deres
      Belønner, som søge ham.
  7.  Ved Tro var det, at Noa, advaret af Gud om det, som endnu ikke
      sås, i Gudsfrygt indrettede en Ark til Frelse for sit Hus; ved
      den domfældte han Verden og blev Arving til Retfærdigheden
      ifølge Tro.
  8.  Ved Tro adlød Abraham, da han blev kaldet, så han gik ud til et
      Sted, som han skulde tage til Arv; og han gik ud, skønt han ikke
      vidste, hvor han kom hen.
  9.  Ved Tro blev han Udlænding i Forjættelsens Land som i et fremmed
      og boede i Telte med Isak og Jakob, som vare Medarvinger til
      samme Forjættelse;
 10.  thi han forventede den Stad, som har fast Grundvold, hvis
      Bygmester og Grundlægger er Gud.
 11.  Ved Tro fik endog Sara selv Kraft til at undfange endog ud over
      sin Alders Tid; thi hun holdt ham for trofast, som havde
      forjættet det.
 12.  Derfor avledes der også af en, og det en udlevet, som Himmelens
      Stjerner i Mangfoldighed og som Sandet ved Havets Bred, det, som
      ikke kan tælles.
 13.  I Tro døde alle disse uden at have opnået Forjættelserne; men de
      så dem langt borte og hilsede dem og bekendte, at de vare
      fremmede og Udlændinge på Jorden.
 14.  De, som sige sådant, give jo klarlig til Kende, at de søge et
      Fædreland.
 15.  Og dersom de havde haft det, hvorfra de vare udgåede, i Tanker,
      havde de vel haft Tid til at vende tilbage;
 16.  men nu hige de efter et bedre, det er et himmelsk; derfor
      skammer Gud sig ikke ved dem, ved at kaldes deres Gud; thi han
      har betedt dem en, Stad.
 17.  Ved Tro har Abraham ofret Isak, da han blev prøvet, ja, den.
      enbårne ofrede han, som havde modtaget Forjættelserne,
 18.  til hvem der var sagt: "I Isak skal en Sæd få Navn efter dig; "
 19.  thi han betænkte, at Gud var mægtig endog til at oprejse fra de
      døde, hvorfra han jo også lignelsesvis fik ham tilbage.
 20.  Ved Tro udtalte Isak Velsignelse over Jakob og Esau angående
      kommende Ting.
 21.  Ved Tro velsignede Jakob døende hver af Josefs Sønner og tilbad,
      lænende sig over sin Stav.
 22.  Ved Tro talte Josef på sit yderste om Israels Børns Udgang og
      gav Befaling om sine Ben.
 23.  Ved Tro blev Moses, da han var født, skjult i tre Måneder af
      sine Forældre, fordi de så, at Barnet var dejligt, og de
      frygtede ikke for Kongens Befaling.
 24.  Ved Tro nægtede Moses, da han var bleven stor, at kaldes Søn af
      Faraos Datter
 25.  og valgte hellere at lide ondt med Guds Folk end at have en
      kortvarig Nydelse af Synd,
 26.  idet han agtede Kristi Forsmædelse for større Rigdom end
      Ægyptens Skatte; thi han så hen til Belønningen.
 27.  Ved Tro forlod han Ægypten uden at frygte for Kongens Vrede; thi
      som om han så den usynlige, holdt han ud.
 28.  Ved Tro har han indstiftet Påsken og Påstrygelsen af Blodet, for
      at den, som ødelagde de førstefødte, ikke skulde røre dem.
 29.  Ved Tro gik de igennem det røde Hav som over tørt Land, medens
      Ægypterne druknede under Forsøget derpå.
 30.  Ved Tro faldt Jerikos Mure, efter at de vare omgåede i syv Dage.
 31.  Ved Tro undgik Skøgen Rahab at omkomme med de genstridige; thi
      hun modtog Spejderne med Fred.
 32.  Dog, hvorfor skal jeg tale mere? Tiden vil jo fattes mig, hvis
      jeg skal fortælle om Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jefta, David og
      Samuel og Profeterne,
 33.  som ved Tro overvandt Riger, øvede Retfærdighed, opnåede
      Forjættelser, stoppede Løvers Mund,
 34.  slukkede Ilds Kraft, undslap Sværds Od, bleve stærke efter
      Svaghed, bleve vældige i Krig, bragte fremmedes Hære til at
      vige.
 35.  Kvinder fik deres døde igen ved Opstandelse. Andre bleve lagte
      på Pinebænk og toge ikke imod Befrielse, for at de måtte opnå en
      bedre Opstandelse.
 36.  Andre måtte friste Forhånelser og Hudstrygelser, tilmed Lænker
      og Fængsel;
 37.  de bleve stenede, gennemsavede, fristede, dræbte med Sværd, gik
      omkring i Fåre- og Gedeskind, lidende Mangel, betrængte,
      mishandlede
 38.  (dem var Verden ikke værd), omvankende i Ørkener og på Bjerge og
      i Huler og Jordens Kløfter.
 39.  Og alle disse, skønt de havde Vidnesbyrd for deres Tro, opnåede
      ikke Forjættelsen,
 40.  efterdi Gud forud havde udset noget bedre for os, for at de ikke
      skulde fuldkommes uden os.

Hebræerne 12

  1.  Derfor lader også os, efterdi vi have så stor en Sky af Vidner
      omkring os, aflægge enhver Byrde og Synden, som lettelig hilder
      os, og med Udholdenhed gennemløbe den foran os liggende Bane,
  2.  idet vi se hen til Troens Begynder og Fuldender, Jesus, som for
      den foran ham liggende Glædes Skyld udholdt et Kors, idet han
      ringeagtede Skændselen, og som har taget Sæde på højre Side af
      Guds Trone.
  3.  Ja, tænker på ham, som har udholdt en sådan Modsigelse imod sig
      af Syndere, for at I ikke skulle blive trætte og forsagte i
      eders Sjæle,

  4.  Endnu have I ikke stået imod indtil Blodet i eders Kamp imod
      Synden,
  5.  og I have glemt Formaningen, der jo dog taler til eder som til
      Sønner: "Min Søn! agt ikke Herrens Tugtelse ringe, vær heller
      ikke forsagt, når du revses af ham;
  6.  thi hvem Herren elsker, den tugter han, og han slår hårdelig
      hver Søn, som han tager sig af."
  7.  Holder ud og lader eder tugte; Gud handler med eder som med
      Sønner; thi hvem er den Søn, som Faderen ikke tugter?
  8.  Men dersom I ere uden Tugtelse, hvori alle have fået Del, da ere
      I jo uægte og ikke Sønner.
  9.  Fremdeles, vore kødelige Fædre havde vi til Optugtere, og vi
      følte Ærefrygt; skulde vi da ikke meget mere underordne os under
      Åndernes Fader og leve?
 10.  thi hine tugtede os for nogle få Dage efter deres Tykke, men han
      gør det til vort Gavn, for at vi skulle få Del i hans Hellighed.
 11.  Al Tugtelse synes vel, imedens den er nærværende, ikke at være
      til Glæde, men til Bedrøvelse; men siden giver den til Gengæld
      dem, som derved ere øvede, en Fredens Frugt i Retfærdighed.

 12.  Derfor, retter de slappede Hænder og de lammede Knæ,
 13.  og træder lige Spor med eders Fødder, for at ikke det lamme skal
      vrides af Led, men snarere helbredes.
 14.  Stræber efter Fred med alle og efter Helliggørelsen, uden
      hvilken ingen skal se Herren;
 15.  og ser til, at ikke nogen går Glip af Guds Nåde, at ikke nogen
      bitter Rod skyder op og gør Skade, og de mange smittes ved den;
 16.  at ikke nogen er en utugtig eller en vanhellig som Esau, der for
      een Ret Mad solgte sin Førstefødselsret.
 17.  Thi I vide, at han også siden, da han ønskede at arve
      Velsignelsen, blev forkastet (thi han fandt ikke Rum for
      Omvendelse), omendskønt han begærede den med Tårer.

 18.  I ere jo ikke komne til en håndgribelig og brændende Ild og til
      Mulm og Mørke og Uvejr,
 19.  og ikke til Basunens Klang og til en talende Røst, hvorom de,
      der hørte den, bade, at der ikke mere måtte tales til dem.
 20.  Thi de kunde ikke bære det, som blev påbudt: "Endog om et Dyr
      rører ved Bjerget, skal det stenes".
 21.  Og - så frygteligt var Synet - Moses sagde: "Jeg er forfærdet og
      bæver."
 22.  Men I ere komne til Zions Bjerg og til den levende Guds Stad,
      til det himmelske Jerusalem og til Englenes Titusinder i
      Højtidsskare
 23.  og til de førstefødtes Menighed, som ere indskrevne i Himlene,
      og til en Dommer, som er alles Gud, og til de fuldkommede
      retfærdiges Ånder
 24.  og til den nye Pagts Mellemmand, Jesus, og til Bestænkelsens
      Blod, som taler bedre end Abel.
 25.  Ser til, at I ikke bede eder fri for den, som taler. Thi når de,
      som bade sig fri for ham, der talte sit Guddomsord på Jorden,
      ikke undslap, da skulle vi det meget mindre, når vi vende os
      bort fra ham, der taler fra Himlene,
 26.  han, hvis Røst dengang rystede Jorden, men som nu har forjættet
      og sagt: "Endnu een Gang vil jeg ryste, ikke alene Jorden, men
      også Himmelen."
 27.  Men dette "endnu een Gang" giver til Kende, at de Ting, der
      rystes, skulle omskiftes, efterdi de ere skabte, for at de Ting,
      der ikke rystes, skulle blive.
 28.  Derfor, efterdi vi modtage et Rige, som ikke kan rystes, så
      lader os være taknemmelige og derved tjene Gud til hans
      Velbehag, med Ængstelse og Frygt.
 29.  Thi vor Gud er en fortærende Ild.

Hebræerne 13

  1.  Broderkærligheden blive ved!
  2.  Glemmer ikke Gæstfriheden; thi ved den have nogle, uden at vide
      det, haft Engle til Gæster.
  3.  Kommer de fangne i Hu, som vare I selv medfangne; dem, der lide
      ilde, som de, der også selv ere i et Legeme.
  4.  Ægteskabet være æret hos alle, og Ægtesengen ubesmittet; thi
      utugtige og Horkarle skal Gud dømme.
  5.  Eders Vandel være uden Pengegridskhed, nøjes med det, I have;
      thi han har selv sagt: "Jeg vil ingenlunde slippe dig og
      ingenlunde forlade dig,"
  6.  så at vi kunne sige med frit Mod: "Herren er min Hjælper, jeg
      vil ikke frygte; hvad kan et Menneske gøre mig?"

  7.  Kommer eders Vejledere i Hu, som have forkyndt eder Guds Ord, og
      idet I betragte deres Vandrings Udgang, så efterligner deres
      Tro!
  8.  Jesus Kristus er i Går og i Dag den samme, ja, til evig Tid.
  9.  Lader eder ikke lede vild af mange Hånde og fremmede Lærdomme;
      thi det er godt, at Hjertet styrkes ved Nåden, ikke ved Spiser;
      thi deraf have de, som holdt sig dertil, ingen Nytte haft.
 10.  Vi have et Alter, hvorfra de, som tjene ved Tabernaklet, ikke
      have Ret til at spise.
 11.  Thi de Dyr, hvis Blod for Syndens Skyld bæres ind i Helligdommen
      af Ypperstepræsten, deres Kroppe opbrændes uden for Lejren.
 12.  Derfor led også Jesus uden for Porten, for at han kunde hellige
      Folket ved sit eget Blod.
 13.  Så lader os da gå ud til ham uden for Lejren, idet vi bære hans
      Forsmædelse;
 14.  thi her have vi ikke en blivende Stad, men vi søge den kommende.
 15.  Lader os da ved ham altid frembære Gud Lovprisnings Offer, det
      er: en Frugt af Læber, som bekende hans Navn.
 16.  Men glemmer ikke at gøre vel og at meddele; thi i sådanne Ofre
      har Gud Velbehag.

 17.  Lyder eders Vejledere og retter eder efter dem; thi de våge
      over, eders Sjæle som de, der skulle gøre Regnskab - for at de
      må gøre dette med Glæde og ikke sukkende: thi dette er eder ikke
      gavnligt.
 18.  Beder for os; thi vi ere forvissede om, at vi have en god
      Samvittighed, idet vi ønske at vandre rettelig i alle Ting.
 19.  Og jeg formaner eder des mere til at gøre dette, for at jeg
      desto snarere kan gives eder igen.

 20.  Men Fredens Gud, som førte den store Fårenes Hyrde, vor Herre
      Jesus, op fra de døde med en evig Pagts Blod,
 21.  han bringe eder til Fuldkommenhed i alt godt, til at gøre hans
      Villie, og han virke i eder det, som er velbehageligt for hans
      Åsyn, ved Jesus Kristus: ham være Æren i Evighedernes Evigheder:
      Amen.
 22.  Jeg beder eder, Brødre! at I finde eder i dette Formaningsord;
      thi jeg har jo skrevet til eder i Korthed.
 23.  Vid, at vor Broder Timotheus er løsladt; sammen med ham vil jeg
      se eder, dersom han snart kommer.
 24.  Hilser alle eders Vejledere og alle de hellige! De fra Italien
      hilse eder.
 25.  Nåden være med eder alle!


Jakob

Jakob 1

  1.  Jakob, Guds og den Herres Jesu Kristi Tjener, hilser de tolv
      Stammer i Adspredelsen.

  2.  Mine Brødre! agter det for idel Glæde, når I stedes i mange
      Hånde Prøvelser,
  3.  vidende, at eders Tros Prøve virker Udholdenhed;
  4.  men Udholdenheden bør medføre fuldkommen Gerning, for at I kunne
      være fuldkomne og uden Brøst, så I ikke stå tilbage i noget.
  5.  Men dersom nogen af eder fattes Visdom, han bede derom til Gud,
      som giver alle gerne og uden Bebrejdelse, så skal den gives ham.
  6.  Men han bede i Tro, uden at tvivle; thi den, som tvivler, ligner
      en Havets Bølge, der drives og kastes af Vinden.
  7.  Ikke må nemlig det Menneske mene, at han skal få noget af Herren,
  8.  en tvesindet Mand, som han er, ustadig på alle sine Veje.

  9.  Men den Broder, som er ringe, rose sig af sin Højhed,
 10.  den rige derimod af sin Ringhed; thi han skal forgå som Græssets
      Blomst.
 11.  Thi Solen står op med sin Hede og hentørrer Græsset, og dets
      Blomst falder af, og dens Skikkelses Ynde forsvinder; således
      skal også den rige visne på sine Veje.

 12.  Salig den Mand, som holder Prøvelse ud; thi når han har stået
      Prøve, skal han få Livets Krans, som Herren har forjættet dem,
      der elske ham.
 13.  Ingen sige, når han fristes: "Jeg fristes af Gud;" thi Gud kan
      ikke fristes af det onde, og selv frister han ingen;
 14.  men enhver fristes,når han drages og lokkes af sin egen
      Begæring;
 15.  derefter, når Begæringen har undfanget, føder den Synd, men når
      Synden er fuldvoksen, føder den Død.
 16.  Farer ikke vild, mine elskede Brødre!
 17.  Al god Gave og al fuldkommen Gave er ovenfra og kommer ned fra
      Lysenes Fader, hos hvem der ikke er Forandring eller skiftende
      Skygge.
 18.  Efter sin Villie fødte han os ved Sandheds Ord, for at vi skulde
      være en Førstegrøde af hans Skabninger.

 19.  I vide det, mine elskede Brødre. Men hvert Menneske være snar
      til at høre, langsom til at tale, langsom til Vrede;
 20.  thi en Mands Vrede udretter ikke det, som er ret for Gud.
 21.  Derfor, aflægger alt Smuds og Levning af Slethed, og modtager
      med Sagtmodighed Ordet, som er indplantet i eder, og som formår
      at frelse eders Sjæle.
 22.  Men vorder Ordets Gørere og ikke alene dets Hørere, hvormed I
      bedrage eder selv.
 23.  Thi dersom nogen er Ordets Hører og ikke dets Gører, han ligner
      en Mand, der betragter sit legemlige Ansigt i et Spejl;
 24.  thi han betragter sig selv og går bort og glemmer straks, hvor
      dan han var.
 25.  Men den, som skuer ind i Frihedens fuldkomne Lov og holder ved
      dermed, så han ikke bliver en glemsom Tilhører, men en
      Gerningens Gører, han skal være salig i sin Gerning.

 26.  Dersom nogen synes, at han dyrker Gud, og ikke holder sin Tunge
      i Tømme, men bedrager sit Hjerte, hans Gudsdyrkelse er forgæves.
 27.  En ren og ubesmittet Gudsdyrkelse for Gud og Faderen er dette,
      at besøge faderløse og Enker i deres Trængsel, at holde sig selv
      uplettet af Verden.

Jakob 2

  1.  Mine Brødre! Eders Tro på vor Herre Jesus Kristus, den
      herliggjorte, være ikke forbunden med Persons Anseelse!
  2.  Når der nemlig kommer en Mand ind i eders Forsamling med
      Guldring på Fingeren, i prægtig Klædning, men der også kommer en
      fattig ind i smudsig Klædning,
  3.  og I fæste Øjet på den, som bærer den prægtige Klædning og sige:
      Sæt du dig her på den gode Plads, og I sige til den fattige: Stå
      du der eller sæt dig nede ved min Fodskammel:
  4.  ere I så ikke komne i Strid med eder selv og blevne Dommere med
      slette Tanker?
  5.  Hører, mine elskede Brødre! Har Gud ikke udvalgt de for Verden
      fattige til at være rige i Tro og Arvinger til det Rige, som han
      har forjættet dem, der elske ham?
  6.  Men I have vanæret den fattige! Er det ikke de rige, som
      underkue eder, og er det ikke dem, som slæbe eder for
      Domstolene?
  7.  Er det ikke dem, som bespotte det skønne Navn, som er nævnet
      over eder?

  8.  Ganske vist, dersom I opfylde den kongelige Lov efter Skriften:
      "Du skal elske din Næste som dig selv", gøre I ret;
  9.  men dersom I anse Personer, gøre I Synd og revses af Loven som
      Overtrædere.
 10.  Thi den, som holder hele Loven, men støder an i eet Stykke, er
      bleven skyldig i alle.
 11.  Thi han, som sagde: "Du må ikke bedrive Hor," sagde også: "Du må
      ikke slå ihjel." Dersom du da ikke bedriver Hor, men slår ihjel,
      da er du bleven en Lovens Overtræder.
 12.  Taler således og gører således, som de, der skulle dømmes efter
      Frihedens Lov.
 13.  Thi Dommen er ubarmhjertig imod den, som ikke har øvet
      Barmhjertighed; Barmhjertighed træder frimodigt op imod Dommen.

 14.  Hvad gavner det, mine Brødre! om nogen siger, han har Tro, men
      ikke har Gerninger? mon Troen kan frelse ham?
 15.  Dersom en Broder eller Søster er nøgen og fattes den daglige
      Føde,
 16.  og en af eder siger til dem: Går bort i Fred, varmer eder og
      mætter eder, men I ikke give dem det, som hører til Legemets
      Nødtørst, hvad gavner det?
 17.  Ligeså er også Troen, dersom den ikke har Gerninger, død i sig
      selv.
 18.  Men man vil sige: Du har Tro, og jeg har Gerninger. Vis mig din
      Tro uden Gerningerne, og jeg vil af mine Gerninger vise dig
      Troen.
 19.  Du tror, at Gud er een; deri gør du ret; også de onde Ånder tro
      det og skælve.
 20.  Men vil du vide, du tomme Menneske! at Troen uden Gerninger er
      unyttig?
 21.  Blev ikke vor Fader Abraham retfærdiggjort af Gerninger, da han
      ofrede sin Søn Isak på Alteret?
 22.  Du ser, at Troen virkede sammen med hans Gerninger, og ved
      Gerningerne blev Troen fuldkommet,
 23.  og Skriften blev opfyldt, som siger: "Abraham troede Gud, og det
      blev regnet ham til Retfærdighed", og han blev kaldet Guds Ven.
 24.  I se, at et Menneske retfærdiggøres af Gerninger, og ikke af Tro
      alene.
 25.  Ligeså Skøgen Rahab, blev ikke også hun retfærdiggjort af
      Gerninger, da hun tog imod Sendebudene og lod dem slippe bort ad
      en anden Vej?
 26.  Thi ligesom Legemet er dødt uden Ånd, således er også Troen død
      uden Gerninger.

Jakob 3

  1.  Mine Brødre! ikke mange af eder bør blive Lærere, såsom I vide,
      at vi skulle få en desto tungere Dom.
  2.  Thi vi støde alle an i mange Ting; dersom nogen ikke støder an i
      Tale, da er han en fuldkommen Mand, i Stand til også at holde
      hele Legemet i Tomme.
  3.  Men når vi lægge Bidsler i Hestenes Munde, for at de skulle
      adlyde os, så dreje vi også hele deres Legeme.
  4.  Se, også Skibene, endskønt de ere så store og drives af stærke
      Vinde, drejes med et såre lidet Ror, hvorhen Styrmandens Hu
      står.
  5.  Således er også Tungen et lille Lem og fører store Ord. Se, hvor
      lille en Ild der stikker så stor en Skov i Brand!
  6.  Og Tungen er en Ild. Som en Verden af Uretfærdighed sidder
      Tungen iblandt vore Lemmer; den besmitter hele Legemet og sætter
      Livets Hjul i Brand, selv sat i Brand af Helvede.
  7.  Thi enhver Natur, både Dyrs og Fugles, både Krybdyrs og Havdyrs,
      tæmmes og er tæmmet af den menneskelige Natur;
  8.  men Tungen kan intet Menneske tæmme, det ustyrlige Onde, fuld af
      dødbringende Gift.
  9.  Med den velsigne vi Herren og Faderen, og med den forbande vi
      Menneskene, som ere blevne til efter Guds Lighed.
 10.  Af den samme Mund udgår Velsignelse og Forbandelse. Mine Brødre!
      dette bør ikke være så.
 11.  Mon en Kilde udgyder sødt Vand og besk Vand af det samme Væld?
 12.  Mon et Figentræ, mine Brødre! kan give Oliven, eller et Vintræ
      Figener? Heller ikke kan en Salt Kilde give fersk Vand.

 13.  Er nogen viis og forstandig iblandt eder, da vise han ved god
      Omgængelse sine Gerninger i viis Sagtmodighed!
 14.  Men have I bitter Avind og Rænkesyge i eders Hjerter, da roser
      eder ikke og lyver ikke imod Sandheden!
 15.  Dette er ikke den Visdom, som kommer ovenfra, men en jordisk,
      sjælelig, djævelsk;
 16.  thi hvor der er Avind og Rænkesyge, der er Forvirring og al ond
      Handel.
 17.  Men Visdommen herovenfra er først ren, dernæst fredsommelig,
      mild, føjelig, fuld at Barmhjertighed og gode Frugter, upartisk,
      uden Skrømt.
 18.  Men Retfærdigheds Frugt såes i Fred for dem, som stifte Fred.

Jakob 4

  1.  Hvoraf kommer det, at den er Krige og Stridigheder iblandt eder?
      mon ikke deraf, af eders Lyster, som stride i eders Lemmer?
  2.  I begære og have ikke; I myrde og misunde og kunne ikke få; I
      føre Strid og Krig. Og I have ikke, fordi I ikke bede;
  3.  I bede og få ikke, fordi I bede ilde, for at øde det i eders
      Lyster.
  4.  I utro! vide I ikke, at Venskab med Verden er Fjendskab imod
      Gud?  Derfor, den, som vil være Verdens Ven, bliver Guds Fjende.
  5.  Eller mene I, at Skriftens Ord ere tomme Ord? Med Nidkærhed
      længes han efter den Ånd, han har givet Bolig i os, men han
      skænker desto større Nåde.
  6.  Derfor siger Skriften: "Gud står de hoffærdige imod, men de
      ydmyge giver han Nåde."
  7.  Underordner eder derfor under Gud; men står Djævelen imod, så
      skal han fly fra eder;
  8.  holder eder nær til Gud, så skal han holde sig nær til eder!
      Renser Hænderne, I Syndere! og lutrer Hjerterne, I tvesindede!
  9.  Jamrer og sørger og græder; eders Latter vende sig til Sorg og
      Glæden til Bedrøvelse!
 10.  Ydmyger eder for Herren, så skal han ophøje eder.

 11.  Taler ikke ilde om hverandre, Brødre! Den, som taler ilde om sin
      Broder eller dømmer sin Broder, taler ilde om Loven og dømmer
      Loven; men dømmer du Loven, da er du ikke Lovens Gører, men dens
      Dommer.
 12.  Een er Lovgiveren og Dommeren, han, som kan frelse og fordærve;
      men hvem er du, som dømmer din Næste?

 13.  Og nu I, som sige: I Dag eller i Morgen ville vi gå til den
      eller den By og blive der et År og købslå og vinde,
 14.  I, som ikke vide, hvad der skal ske i Morgen; thi hvordan er
      eders Liv? I ere jo en Damp, som er til Syne en liden Tid, men
      derefter forsvinder;
 15.  i Stedet for at I skulle sige: Dersom Herren vil, og vi leve, da
      ville vi gøre dette eller hint.
 16.  Men nu rose I eder i eders Overmod; al sådan Ros er ond.
 17.  Derfor, den som ved at handle ret og ikke gør det, for ham er
      det Synd.

Jakob 5

  1.  Og nu, I rige! græder og jamrer over de Ulykker, som komme over
      eder.
  2.  Eders Rigdom er rådnet, og eders Klæder er mølædte;
  3.  eders Guld og Sølv er rustet op, og deres Rust skal være til
      Vidnesbyrd imod eder og æde eders Kød som en Ild; I have samlet
      Skatte i de sidste Dage.
  4.  Se, den Løn skriger, som I have forholdt Arbejderne, der høstede
      eders Marker, og Høstfolkenes Råb ere komne ind for den Herre
      Zebaoths Øren.
  5.  I levede i Vellevned på Jorden og efter eders Lyster; I gjorde
      eders Hjerter til gode som på en Slagtedag.
  6.  I domfældte, I dræbte den retfærdige; han står eder ikke imod.

  7.  Derfor, værer tålmodige, Brødre! indtil Herrens Tilkommelse. Se,
      Bonden venter på Jordens dyrebare Frugt og bier tålmodigt efter
      den, indtil den får tidlig Regn og sildig Regn.
  8.  Værer også I tålmodige, styrker eders Hjerter; thi Herrens
      Tilkommelse er nær.
  9.  Sukker ikke imod hverandre, Brødre! for at I ikke skulle dømmes;
      se, Dommeren står for Døren.
 10.  Brødre! tager Profeterne, som have talt i Herrens Navn, til
      Forbillede på at lide ondt og være tålmodige.
 11.  Se, vi prise dem salige, som have holdt ud. I have hørt om Jobs
      Udholdenhed og vide Udfaldet fra Herren; thi Herren er såre
      medlidende og barmhjertig.

 12.  Men for alting, mine Brødre! sværger ikke, hverken ved Himmelen
      eller ved Jorden eller nogen anden Ed; men eders Ja være Ja, og
      Nej være Nej, for at I ikke skulle falde under Dom.

 13.  Lider nogen iblandt eder ondt, han bede; er nogen vel til Mode,
      han synge Lovsang!
 14.  Er nogen iblandt eder syg, han kalde Menighedens Ældste til sig,
      og de skulle bede over ham og salve ham med Olie i Herrens Navn.
 15.  Og Troens Bøn skal frelse den syge, og Herren skal oprejse ham,
      og har han gjort Synder, skulle de forlades ham.
 16.  Bekender derfor Synderne for hverandre og beder for hverandre,
      for at I må blive helbredte; en retfærdigs Bøn formår meget, når
      den er alvorlig.
 17.  Elias var et Menneske, lige Vilkår undergivet med os, og han bad
      en Bøn, at det ikke måtte regne; og det regnede ikke på Jorden i
      tre År og seks Måneder.
 18.  Og han bad atter, og Himmelen gav Regn, og Jorden bar sin Frugt.

 19.  Mine Brødre! dersom nogen iblandt eder farer vild fra Sandheden,
      og nogen omvender ham,
 20.  han vide, at den, som omvender en Synder fra hans Vejs
      Vildfarelse, han Frelser en Sjæl fra Døden og skjuler en
      Mangfoldighed af Synder.


1.Peter

1.Peter 1

  1.  Peter, Jesu Kristi Apostel, til Udlændingene i Adspredelse i
      Pontus, Galatien, Kappadokien, Asien og Bithynien,
  2.  udvalgte efter Gud Faders Forudviden, ved Åndens Helligelse, til
      Lydighed og Bestænkelse med Jesu Kristi Blod: Nåde og Fred vorde
      eder mangfoldig til Del!

  3.  Lovet være Gud og vor Herres Jesu Kristi Fader, som efter sin
      store Barmhjertighed har genfødt os til et levende Håb ved Jesu
      Kristi Opstandelse fra de døde,
  4.  til en uforkrænkelig og ubesmittelig og uvisnelig Arv, som er
      bevaret i Himlene til eder,
  5.  I, som ved Guds Kraft bevogtes ved Tro til en Frelse, som er
      rede til at åbenbares i den sidste Tid,
  6.  i hvilken I skulle fryde eder, om I end nu en liden Stund, hvis
      så skal være, bedrøves i mange Hånde Prøvelser,
  7.  for at eders prøvede Tro, som er meget dyrebarere end det
      forgængelige Guld, der dog prøves ved Ild, må findes til Ros og
      Herlighed og Ære i Jesu Kristi Åbenbarelse,
  8.  ham, som I ikke have set og dog elske, ham, som I, skønt I nu
      ikke se, men tro, skulle fryde eder over med en uudsigelig og
      forherliget Glæde,
  9.  når I nå Målet for eders Tro, Sjælenes Frelse.
 10.  Om denne Frelse have Profeter gransket og ransaget, de, som
      profeterede om den Nåde, der skulde blive eder til Del,
 11.  idet de granskede over, hvilken eller hvordan en Tid Kristi Ånd,
      som var i dem, henviste til, når den forud vidnede om Kristi
      Lidelser og den derpå følgende Herlighed.
 12.  Og det blev dem åbenbaret, at det ikke var dem selv, men eder,
      de tjente med disse Ting, som nu ere blevne eder kundgjorte ved
      dem, der have forkyndt eder Evangeliet i den Helligånd, som blev
      sendt fra Himmelen, hvilke Ting Engle begære at skue ind i.

 13.  Derfor, binder op om eders Sinds Lænder, værer ædrue, og sætter
      fuldt ud eders Håb til den Nåde, som bliver eder til Del i Jesu
      Kristi Åbenbarelse.
 14.  Som lydige Børn skulle I ikke skikke eder efter de forrige
      Lyster i eders Vankundighed;
 15.  men efter den hellige, som kaldte eder, skulle også I vorde
      hellige i al eders Vandel;
 16.  thi der er skrevet: "I skulle være hellige, thi jeg er hellig."
 17.  Og dersom I påkalde ham som Fader, der dømmer uden Persons
      Anseelse efter enhvers Gerning, da bør I vandre i Frygt eders
      Udlændigheds Tid,
 18.  vel vidende, at det ikke var med forkrænkelige Ting,, Sølv eller
      Guld, at I bleve løskøbte fra eders tomme Vandel, som var
      overleveret eder fra Fædrene,
 19.  men med Kristi dyrebare Blod som et lydeløst og uplettet Lams,
 20.  han, som var forud kendt for Verdens Grundlæggelse, men blev
      åbenbaret ved Tidernes Ende for eders Skyld,
 21.  der ved ham tro på Gud, som oprejste ham fra de døde og gav ham
      Herlighed, så at eders Tro også er Håb til Gud.

 22.  Lutrer eders Sjæle i Lydighed imod Sandheden til uskrømtet
      Broderkærlighed, og elsker hverandre inderligt af Hjertet,
 23.  genfødte, som I ere, ikke af forkrænkelig, men af uforkrænkelig
      Sæd, ved Guds levende og blivende Ord.
 24.  Thi "alt Kød er som Græs, og al dets Herlighed som Græssets
      Blomst; Græsset visner, og Blomsten falder af;
 25.  men Herrens Ord bliver evindelig." Og dette er det Ord, som er
      forkyndt eder ved Evangeliet.

1.Peter 2

  1.  Derfor aflægger al Ondskab og al Svig og Hykleri og Avind og al
      Bagtalelse,
  2.  og higer som nyfødte Børn efter Ordets uforfalskede Mælk, for at
      I kunne vokse ved den til Frelse,
  3.  om I da have smagt, at Herren er god.
  4.  Kommer til ham, den levende Sten, der vel er forkastet af
      Menneskene, men er udvalgt og dyrebar for Gud,
  5.  og lader eder selv som levende Sten opbygge som et åndeligt Hus,
      til et helligt Præsteskab, til at frembære åndelige Ofre,
      velbehagelige for Gud ved Jesus Kristus.
  6.  Thi det hedder i et Skriftsted: "Se, jeg lægger i Zion en
      Hovedhjørnesten, som er udvalgt og dyrebar; og den, som tror på
      ham, skal ingenlunde blive til Skamme."
  7.  Eder altså, som tro, hører Æren til; men for de vantro er denne
      Sten, som Bygningsmændene forkastede, bleven til en
      Hovedhjørnesten og en Anstødssten og en Forargelses Klippe;
  8.  og de støde an, idet de ere genstridige imod Ordet, hvortil de
      også vare bestemte.
  9.  Men I ere en udvalgt Slægt, et kongeligt Præsteskab, et helligt
      Folk, et Folk til Ejendom, for at I skulle forkynde hans Dyder,
      som kaldte eder fra Mørke til sit underfulde Lys,
 10.  I, som fordum ikke vare et Folk, men nu ere Guds Folk, I, som
      ikke fandt Barmhjertighed, men nu have fundet Barmhjertighed.

 11.  I elskede! jeg formaner eder som fremmede og Udlændinge til at
      afolde eder fra kødelige Lyster, som jo føre Krig imod Sjælen,
 12.  så I føre en god Vandel iblandt Hedningerne, for at de på Grund
      af de gode Gerninger, som de få at se, kunne prise Gud på
      Besøgelsens Dag for det, som de bagtale eder for som
      Ugerningsmænd.

 13.  Underordner eder under al menneskelig Ordning for Herrens Skyld,
      være sig en Konge som den højeste,
 14.  eller Landshøvdinger som dem, der sendes af ham til Straf for
      Ugerningsmænd, men til Ros for dem, som gøre det gode.
 15.  Thi således er det Guds Villie, at I ved at gøre det gode skulle
      bringe de uforstandige Menneskers Vankundighed til at tie;
 16.  som frie, og ikke som de, der have Friheden til Ondskabs Skjul,
      men som Guds Tjenere.
 17.  Ærer alle, elsker Broderskabet, frygter Gud, ærer Kongen!

 18.  I Trælle! underordner eder under eders Herrer i al Frygt, ikke
      alene de gode og milde, men også de urimelige.
 19.  Thi dette finder Yndest, dersom nogen, bunden til Gud i sin
      Samvittighed, udholder Genvordigheder, skønt han lider
      uretfærdigt.
 20.  Thi hvad Ros er det, om I holde ud, når I Synde og derfor få
      Næveslag? Men dersom I holde ud, når I gøre det gode og lide
      derfor, dette finder Yndest hos Gud.
 21.  Thi dertil bleve I kaldede, efterdi også Kristus har lidt for
      eder, efterladende eder et Forbillede, for at I skulle følge i
      hans Fodspor,
 22.  han, som ikke gjorde Synd, ikke heller blev der fundet Svig i
      hans Mund,
 23.  han, som ikke skældte igen, da han blev udskældt, ikke truede,
      da han led, men overgav det til ham, som dømmer retfærdigt,
 24.  han, som selv bar vore Synder på sit Legeme op på Træet, for at
      vi, afdøde fra vore Synder, skulle leve for Retfærdigheden, han,
      ved hvis Sår I ere blevne lægte.
 25.  Thi I vare vildfarende som Får, men ere nu vendte om til eders
      Sjæles Hyrde og Tilsynsmand.

1.Peter 3

  1.  Ligeså, I Hustruer! underordner eder under eders egne Mænd, for
      at, selv om nogle ere genstridige imod Ordet, de kunne vindes
      uden Ord ved Hustruernes Vandel,
  2.  når de iagttage eders kyske Vandel i Frygt.
  3.  Eders Prydelse skal ikke være den udvortes med Hårfletning og
      påhængte Guldsmykker eller Klædedragt,
  4.  men Hjertets skjulte Menneske med den sagtmodige og stille Ånds
      uforkrænkelige Prydelse, hvilket er meget kosteligt for Gud.
  5.  Thi således var det også, at fordum de hellige Kvinder, som
      håbede på Gud, prydede sig, idet de underordnede sig under deres
      egne Mænd,
  6.  som Sara var Abraham lydig, så hun kaldte ham Herre, hun, hvis
      Børn I ere blevne, når I gøre det gode og ikke frygte nogen
      Rædsel.
  7.  Ligeså I Mænd! lever med Forstand sammen med eders Hustruer som
      med et svagere Kar, og beviser dem Ære som dem, der også ere
      Medarvinger til Livets Nådegave, for at eders Bønner ikke skulle
      hindres.

  8.  Og til Slutning værer alle enssindede, medlidende, kærlige imod
      Brødrene, barmhjertige, ydmyge;
  9.  betaler ikke ondt med ondt, eller Skældsord med Skældsord, men
      tværtimod velsigner, thi dertil bleve I kaldede, at I skulle
      arve Velsignelse.
 10.  Thi "den, som vil elske Livet og se gode Dage, skal holde sin
      Tunge fra ondt og sine Læber fra at tale Svig;
 11.  han vende sig fra ondt og gøre godt; han søge Fred og jage efter
      den!
 12.  Thi Herrens Øjne ere over de retfærdige, og hans Øren til deres
      Bøn; men Herrens Ansigt er over dem, som gøre ondt."

 13.  Og hvem er der, som kan volde eder ondt, dersom I ere nidkære
      for det gode?
 14.  Men om I også måtte lide for Retfærdigheds Skyld, er I salige.
      Nærer ingen Frygt for dem, og forfærdes ikke;
 15.  men helliger den Herre Kristus i eders Hjerter, altid rede til
      at forsvare eder over for enhver, som kræver eder til Regnskab
      for det Håb, der er i eder, men med Sagtmodighed og Frygt,
 16.  idet I have en god Samvittighed, for at de, der laste eders gode
      Vandel i Kristus, må blive til Skamme, når de bagtale eder som
      Ugerningsmænd.
 17.  Thi det er bedre, om det så er Guds Villie, at lide, når man gør
      godt, end når man gør ondt.
 18.  Thi også Kristus led een Gang for Synder, en retfærdig for
      uretfærdige, for at han kunde føre os hen til Gud, han, som led
      Døden i Kødet, men blev levendegjort i Ånden,
 19.  i hvilken han også gik hen og prædikede for Ånderne, som vare i
      Forvaring,
 20.  som fordum vare genstridige, dengang Guds Langmodighed ventede i
      Noas Dage, medens Arken byggedes, i hvilken få, nemlig otte,
      Sjæle bleve frelste igennem Vand,
 21.  hvilket nu også frelser eder i sit Modbillede som Dåb, der ikke
      er Fjernelse af Kødets Urenhed, men en god Samvittigheds Pagt
      med Gud ved Jesu Kristi Opstandelse,
 22.  han, som er faren til Himmelen og er ved Guds højre Hånd, efter
      at Engle og Myndigheder og Kræfter ere ham underlagte.

1.Peter 4

  1.  Efterdi da Kristus har lidt i Kødet, så skulle også I væbne eder
      med det samme Sind (thi den, som har lidt i Kødet, er hørt op
      med Synd),
  2.  så at I ikke fremdeles leve den øvrige Tid i Kødet efter
      Menneskers Lyster, men efter Guds Villie.
  3.  Thi det er nok i den forbigangne Tid at have gjort Hedningernes
      Villie, idet I have vandret i Uterlighed, Lyster, Fylderi, Svir,
      Drik og skammelig Afgudsdyrkelse;
  4.  hvorfor de forundre sig og spotte, når I ikke løbe med til den
      samme Ryggesløshedens Pøl;
  5.  men de skulle gøre ham Regnskab, som er rede til at dømme
      levende og døde.
  6.  Thi derfor blev Evangeliet forkyndt også for døde, for at de vel
      skulde være dømte på Menneskers Vis i Kødet, men leve på Guds
      Vis i Ånden.

  7.  Men alle Tings Ende er kommen nær; værer derfor årvågne og ædru
      til Bønner!
  8.  Hav fremfor alt en inderlig Kærlighed til hverandre; thi
      "Kærlighed skjuler en Mangfoldighed af Synder".
  9.  Vær gæstfri imod hverandre uden Knurren.
 10.  Eftersom enhver har fået en Nådegave, skulle I tjene hverandre
      dermed som gode Husholdere over Guds mangfoldige Nåde.
 11.  Taler nogen, han tale som Guds Ord; har nogen en Tjeneste, han
      tjene, efter som Gud forlener ham Styrke dertil, for at Gud må
      æres i alle Ting ved Jesus Kristus, hvem Herligheden og Magten
      tilhører i Evighedernes Evigheder! Amen.

 12.  I elskede! undrer eder ikke over den Ild, som brænder iblandt
      eder til eders Prøvelse, som om der hændtes eder noget
      underligt;
 13.  men glæder eder i samme Mål, som I have Del i Kristi Lidelser,
      for at I også kunne glæde og fryde eder ved hans Herligheds
      Åbenbarelse.
 14.  Dersom I hånes for Kristi Navns Skyld, ere I salige; thi
      Herlighedens og Guds Ånd hviler over eder.
 15.  Thi ingen af eder bør lide som Morder eller Tyv eller
      Ugerningsmand eller som en, der blander sig i anden Mands Sager;
 16.  men lider han som en Kristen, da skamme han sig ikke, men prise
      Gud for dette Navn!

 17.  Thi det er Tiden til, at Dommen skal begynde med Guds Hus: men
      begynder den først med os, hvad Ende vil det da få med dem, som
      ere genstridige imod Guds Evangelium?
 18.  Og dersom den retfærdige med Nød og neppe bliver frelst, hvor
      skal da den ugudelige og Synderen blive af?
 19.  Derfor skulle også de, som lide efter Guds Villie, befale den
      trofaste Skaber deres Sjæle, idet de gøre det gode.

1.Peter 5

  1.  De Ældste iblandt eder formaner jeg som Medældste og Vidne til
      Kristi Lidelser, som den, der også har Del i Herligheden, der
      skal åbenbares:
  2.  Vogter Guds Hjord hos eder, og fører Tilsyn med den, ikke
      tvungne, men frivilligt, ikke for slet Vindings Skyld, men med
      Redebonhed;
  3.  ikke heller som de, der ville herske over Menighederne, men som
      Mønstre for Hjorden;
  4.  og når da Overhyrden åbenbares, skulle I få Herlighedens
      uvisnelige Krans.
  5.  Ligeså, I unge! underordner eder under de ældre; og ifører eder
      alle Ydmyghed imod hverandre; thi "Gud står de hoffærdige imod,
      men de ydmyge giver han Nåde."
  6.  Derfor ydmyger eder under Guds vældige Hånd, for at han i sin
      Tid må ophøje eder.
  7.  Kaster al eders Sørg på ham, thi han har Omsorg for eder.
  8.  Vær ædru, våger; eders Modstander, Djævelen, går omkring som en
      brølende Løve, søgende, hvem han kan opsluge.
  9.  Står ham imod, faste i Troen, vidende, at de samme Lidelser
      fuldbyrdes på eders Brødre i Verden.

 10.  Men al Nådes Gud, som kaldte eder til sin evige Herlighed i
      Kristus Jesus efter en kort Tids Lidelse, han vil selv fuldelig
      berede eder, styrke, bekræfte, grundfæste eder!
 11.  Ham tilhører Magten i Evighedernes Evigheder! Amen.
 12.  Med Silvanus, den trofaste Broder (thi det holder jeg ham for),
      har jeg i Korthed skrevet eder til for at formane og bevidne, at
      dette er Guds sande Nåde, hvori I stå.
 13.  Den medudvalgte i Babylon og min Søn, Markus, hilser eder.
 14.  Hilser hverandre med Kærligheds Kys! Fred være med eder alle,
      som ere i Kristus!


2.Peter

2.Peter 1

  1.  Simon Peter, Jesu Kristi Tjener og Apostel, til dem, der have
      fået samme dyrebare Tro som vi ved vor Guds og Frelsers Jesu
      Kristi Retfærdighed:
  2.  Nåde og Fred vorde eder mangfoldig til Del i Erkendelse af Gud
      og vor Herre Jesus.

  3.  Såsom hans guddommelige Magt har skænket os alt, hvad der hører
      til Liv og Gudfrygtighed ved Erkendelsen af ham, som kaldte os
      ved sin Herlighed og Kraft,
  4.  hvorved han har skænket os de største og dyrebare Forjættelser,
      for at I ved disse skulle få Del i guddommelig Natur, når I
      undfly Fordærvelsen i Verden, som har sin Grund i Begær,
  5.  så anvender just derfor al Flid på i eders Tro at udvise Dyd og
      i Dyden Kundskab
  6.  og i Kundskaben Afholdenhed og i Afholdenheden Udholdenhed og i
      Udholdenheden Gudsfrygt
  7.  og i Gudsfrygten Broderkærlighed og i Broderkærligheden
      Kærlighed.
  8.  Thi når dette findes hos eder og er i Tiltagen, lader det eder
      ikke stå ørkesløse eller ufrugtbare i Erkendelsen af vor Herre
      Jesus Kristus;
  9.  den nemlig, som ikke har dette, er blind, svagsynet, idet han
      har glemt Renselsen fra sine fordums Synder.
 10.  Derfor, Brødre! gører eder des mere Flid for at befæste eders
      Kaldelse og Udvælgelse; thi når I gøre dette, skulle I ingen
      Sinde støde an.
 11.  Thi så skal der rigelig gives eder Indgang i vor Herres og
      Frelsers Jesu Kristi evige Rige.

 12.  Derfor vil jeg ikke forsømme altid at påminde eder om delte,
      ihvorvel I vide det og ere befæstede i den Sandhed, som er til
      Stede hos os.
 13.  Men jeg anser det for ret at vække eder ved Påmindelse, så længe
      jeg er i dette Telt,
 14.  da jeg ved, at Aflæggelsen af mit Telt kommer brat, således som
      jo vor Herre Jesus Kristus har givet mig til Kende.
 15.  Og jeg vil også gøre mig Flid for, at I til enhver Tid efter min
      Bortgang kunne drage eder dette i Minde.
 16.  Thi vi have ikke fulgt klogtigt opdigtede Fabler, da vi
      kundgjorde eder vor Herres Jesu Kristi Kraft og Tilkommelse, men
      vi have været Øjenvidner til hans Majestæt,
 17.  nemlig da han fik Ære og Herlighed af Gud Fader, idet en sådan
      Røst lød til ham fra den majestætiske Herlighed: "Denne er min
      Søn, den elskede, i hvem jeg har Velbehag."
 18.  Og vi hørte denne Røst lyde fra Himmelen, da vi vare med ham på
      det hellige Bjerg.
 19.  Og des mere stadfæstet have vi det profetiske Ord, hvilket I
      gøre vel i at agte på som på et Lys, der skinner på et mørkt
      Sted, indtil Dagen bryder frem, og Morgenstjernen oprinder i
      eders Hjerter,
 20.  idet I fornemmelig mærke eder dette, at ingen Profeti i Skriften
      beror på egen Tydning.
 21.  Thi aldrig er nogen Profeti bleven fremført ved et Menneskes
      Villie; men drevne af den Helligånd talte hellige Guds Mænd.

2.Peter 2

  1.  Men der opstod også falske Profeter iblandt Folket, ligesom der
      også iblandt eder vil komme falske Lærere, som ville liste
      fordærvelige Vranglærdomme ind, idet de endog fornægte den
      Herre, som købte dem, og bringe en brat Undergang over sig selv,
  2.  og mange ville efterfølge deres Uterligheder, så Sandhedens Vej
      for deres Skyld vil blive bespottet,
  3.  og i Havesyge ville de med falske Ord skaffe sig Vinding af
      eder; men Dommen over dem har alt fra gamle Dage været i
      Virksomhed, og deres Undergang slumrer ikke.

  4.  Thi når Gud ikke sparede Engle, da de syndede, men nedstyrtede
      dem i Afgrunden og overgav dem til Mørkets Huler for at bevogtes
      til Dom,
  5.  og ikke sparede den gamle Verden, men bevarede Retfærdighedens
      Prædiker Noa selv ottende, da han førte Oversvømmelse over en
      Verden af ugudelige
  6.  og lagde Sodomas og Gomorras Stæder i Aske og domfældte dem til
      Ødelæggelse, så han har sat dem til Forbillede for dem, som i
      Fremtiden ville leve ugudeligt,
  7.  og udfriede den retfærdige Lot, som plagedes af de ryggesløses
      uterlige Vandel,
  8.  (thi medens den retfærdige boede iblandt dem, pintes han Dag for
      Dag i sin retfærdige Sjæl ved de lovløse Gerninger, som han så
      og hørte):
  9.  - da ved Herren at udfri gudfrygtige af Fristelse, men at
      straffe og bevogte uretfærdige til Dommens Dag,
 10.  og mest dem, som vandre efter Kød, i Begær efter Besmittelse, og
      foragte Herskab. Frække, selvbehagelige, bæve de ikke ved at
      bespotte Herligheder,
 11.  hvor dog Engle, som ere større i Styrke og Magt, ikke fremføre
      bespottende Dom imod dem for Herren.
 12.  Men disse ligesom ufornuftige Dyr, der af Natur ere fødte til at
      fanges og ødelægges, skulle de, fordi de bespotte, hvad de ikke
      kende, også ødelægges med hines Ødelæggelse,
 13.  idet de få Uretfærdigheds Løn. De sætte deres Lyst i Vellevned
      om Dagen, disse Skampletter og Skændselsmennesker! De svælge i
      deres Bedragerier, medens de holde Gilde med eder;
 14.  deres Øjne ere fulde af Horeri og kunne ikke få nok af Synd; de
      lokke ubefæstede Sjæle; de have et Hjerte, øvet i Havesyge,
      Forbandelsens Børn;
 15.  de have forladt den lige Vej og ere farne vild, følgende
      Bileams, Beors Søns, Vej, han, som elskede Uretfærdigheds Løn,
 16.  men fik Revselse for sin Overtrædelse: et umælende Trældyr talte
      med menneskelig Røst og hindrede Profetens Afsind.
 17.  Disse ere vandløse Kilder og Tågeskyer, som drives af Storvind;
      for dem er Mørke og Mulm bevaret.
 18.  Thi dem, som ere lige ved at undslippe fra dem, der vandre i
      Vildfarelse, løkke de i Kødets Begæringer ved Uterligheder, idet
      de tale Tomheds overmodige Ord
 19.  og love dem Frihed, skønt de selv ere Fordærvelsens Trælle; thi
      man er Træl af det, som man er overvunden af.
 20.  Thi dersom de, efter at have undflyet Verdens Besmittelser ved
      Erkendelse af vor Herre og Frelser Jesus Kristus, igen lade sig
      indvikle deri og overvindes, da er det sidste blevet værre med
      dem end det første.
 21.  Thi bedre havde det været dem ikke at have erkendt
      Retfærdighedens Vej end efter at have erkendt den at vende sig
      bort fra det hellige Bud, som var blevet dem overgivet.
 22.  Det er gået dem efter det sande Ordsprog: "Hunden vender sig om
      til sit eget Spy, og den toede So til at vælte sig i Sølen."

2.Peter 3

  1.  Dette er allerede, I elskede! det andet Brev, som jeg skriver
      til eder, hvori jeg ved Påmindelse vækker eders rene Sind
  2.  til at komme de Ord i Hu, som forud ere sagte af de hellige
      Profeter, og eders Apostles Befaling fra Herren og Frelseren,
  3.  idet I først og fremmest mærke eder dette, at i de sidste Dage
      skal der komme Spottere med Spot, som vandre efter deres egne
      Begæringer
  4.  og sige: "Hvad bliver der af Forjættelsen om hans Tilkommelse?
      Fra den Dag, Fædrene sov hen, forblive jo alle Ting, som de
      vare, lige fra Skabningens Begyndelse."
  5.  Thi med Villie ere de blinde for dette, at fra fordums Tid var
      der Himle og en Jord, som var fremstået af Vand og ved Vand i
      Kraft af Guds Ord,
  6.  hvorved den daværende Verden gik til Grunde i en Vandflod.
  7.  Men de nuværende Himle og Jorden holdes ved det samme Ord i
      Forvaring til Ild, idet de bevares til de ugudelige Menneskers
      Doms og Undergangs Dag.
  8.  Men dette ene bør ikke undgå eder, I elskede! at een Dag er for
      Herren som tusinde År, og tusinde År som een Dag.
  9.  Herren forhaler ikke Forjættelsen (som nogle agte det for en
      Forhaling), men han er langmodig for eders Skyld, idet han ikke
      vil, at nogen skal fortabes, men at alle skulle komme til
      Omvendelse.
 10.  Men Herrens Dag skal komme som en Tyv; på den skulle Himlene
      forgå med stort Bulder, og Elementerne skulle komme i Brand og
      opløses, og Jorden og alt, hvad der er på den, skal opbrændes.

 11.  Efterdi da alt dette opløses, hvor bør I da ikke færdes i hellig
      Vandel og Gudsfrygt,
 12.  idet I forvente og fremskynde Guds Dags Tilkommelse, for hvis
      Skyld Himle skulle antændes og opløses, og Elementer komme i
      Brand og smelte.
 13.  Men vi forvente efter hans Forjættelse nye Himle og en ny Jord,
      i hvilke Retfærdighed bor.
 14.  Derfor, I elskede! efterdi I forvente dette, så gører eder Flid
      for at findes uplettede og ulastelige for ham i Fred,
 15.  og agter vor Herres Langmodighed for Frelse; ligesom også vor
      elskede Broder Paulus efter den ham givne Visdom har skrevet til
      eder,
 16.  som han også gør i alle sine Breve, når han i dem taler om disse
      Ting; i dem findes der Ting, vanskelige at forstå, som de
      ukyndige og ubefæstede fordreje, ligesom også de øvrige
      Skrifter, til deres egen Undergang.
 17.  Da I altså, I elskede! vide det forud, såvogter eder, for at I
      ikke skulle rives med af de ryggesløses Vildfarelse og affalde
      fra eders egen Fasthed;
 18.  men vokser i vor Herres og Frelsers Jesu Kristi Nåde og
      Kundskab!  Ham tilhører Herligheden både nu og indtil Evighedens
      Dag!


1.Johannes

1.Johannes 1

  1.  Det, som var fra Begyndelsen, det, vi have hørt, det, vi have
      set med vore Øjne, det, vi skuede og vore Hænder følte på,
      nemlig om Livets Ord; -
  2.  og Livet blev åbenbaret, og vi have set og vidne og forkynde
      eder det evige Liv, som jo var hos Faderen og blev åbenbaret for
      os; -
  3.  hvad vi have set og hørt, forkynde vi også eder, for at også I
      må have Samfund med os; men vort Samfund er med Faderen og med
      hans Søn Jesus Kristus.
  4.  Og dette skrive vi til eder, for at eders Glæde må være
      fuldkommen.

  5.  Og dette er det Budskab, som vi have hørt af ham og forkynde
      eder, at Gud er Lys, og der er slet intet Mørke i ham.
  6.  Dersom vi sige, at vi have Samfund med ham, og vandre i Mørket,
      da lyve vi og gøre ikke Sandheden.
  7.  Men dersom vi vandre i Lyset, ligesom han er i Lyset, have vi
      Samfund med hverandre,og Jesu, hans Søns, Blod renser os fra al
      Synd.
  8.  Dersom vi sige, at vi ikke have Synd, bedrage vi os selv, og
      Sandheden er ikke i os.
  9.  Dersom vi bekende vore Synder, er han trofast og retfærdig, så
      at han forlader os Synderne og renser os fra al Uretfærdighed.
 10.  Dersom vi sige, at vi ikke have syndet, gøre vi ham til en
      Løgner, og hans Ord er ikke i os.

1.Johannes 2

  1.  Mine Børn! dette skriver jeg til eder, for at I ikke skulle
      synde.  Og dersom nogen synder, have vi en Talsmand hos Faderen,
      Jesus Kristus, den retfærdige,
  2.  og han er en Forsoning for vore Synder, dog ikke alene for vore,
      men også for hele Verdens.

  3.  Og derpå kende vi, at vi have kendt ham, om vi holde hans Bud.
  4.  Den, som siger: "Jeg kender ham," og ikke holder hans Bud. han
      er en Løgner, og i ham er Sandheden ikke;
  5.  men den, som holder hans Ord, i ham er sandelig Guds Kærlighed
      fuldkommet. Derpå kende vi, at vi ere i ham.
  6.  Den, som siger, at han bliver i ham, han er også skyldig selv at
      vandre således, som han vandrede.
  7.  I elskede, jeg skriver til eder ikke et nyt Bud, men et gammelt
      Bud, som I have haft fra Begyndelsen. Det gamle Bud er det Ord,
      som I have hørt.
  8.  Og dog skriver jeg til eder et nyt Bud, hvilket er sandt i ham
      og i eder, thi Mørket drager bort, og det sande Lys skinner
      allerede.
  9.  Den,som siger,at han er i Lyset,og hader sin Broder, han er i
      Mørket endnu.
 10.  Den, som elsker sin Broder, bliver i Lyset, og der er ingen
      Forargelse i ham.
 11.  Men den, som hader sin Broder, er i Mørket og vandrer i Mørket,
      og han ved ikke, hvor han går hen, fordi Mørket har blindet hans
      Øjne.

 12.  Jeg skriver til eder, mine Børn! fordi eders Synder ere eder
      forladte for hans Navns Skyld.
 13.  Jeg skriver til eder, I Fædre! fordi I kende ham, som er fra
      Begyndelsen. Jeg skriver til eder, I unge! fordi I have
      overvundet den onde. Jeg har skrevet til eder, mine Børn! fordi
      I kende Faderen.
 14.  Jeg har skrevet til eder, I Fædre! fordi I kende ham, som er fra
      Begyndelsen. Jeg har skrevet til eder, I unge! fordi I ere
      stærke, og Guds Ord bliver i eder, og I have overvundet den
      onde.
 15.  Elsker ikke Verden, ikke heller de Ting, som ere i Verden!
      Dersom nogen elsker Verden, er Faderens Kærlighed ikke i ham.
 16.  Thi alt det, som er i Verden, Kødets Lyst og Øjnenes Lyst og
      Livets Hoffærdighed, er ikke af Faderen, men af Verden.
 17.  Og Verden forgår og dens Lyst; men den, som gør Guds Villie,
      bliver til evig Tid.

 18.  Mine Børn! det er den sidste Time, og som I have hørt, at
      Antikrist kommer, således ere nu mange Antikrister fremtrådte;
      deraf kende vi, at det er den sidste Time.
 19.  De ere udgåede fra os, men de vare ikke af os; thi dersom de
      havde været af os, da vare de blevne hos os. Dog, det var, for
      at det skulde blive åbenbart, at de ikke alle ere af os.
 20.  Og I have Salvelse fra den hellige og vide alt.
 21.  Jeg har ikke skrevet til eder, fordi I ikke vide Sandheden; men
      fordi I vide den og vide, at ingen Løgn er af Sandheden.
 22.  Hvem er Løgneren uden den, som nægter, at Jesus er Kristus?
      Denne er Antikristen, som fornægter Faderen og Sønnen.
 23.  Hver den, som fornægter Sønnen, har ej heller Faderen; den, som
      bekender Sønnen, har også Faderen.
 24.  Hvad I have hørt fra Begyndelsen, det blive i eder! Dersom det,
      som I have hørt fra Begyndelsen, bliver i eder, skulle også I
      blive i Sønnen og i Faderen.
 25.  Og dette er den Forjættelse, som han selv tilsagde os, det evige
      Liv.
 26.  Dette har jeg skrevet til eder om dem, som forføre eder.
 27.  Og den Salvelse, som I fik af ham, bliver i eder, og I have ikke
      nødig, at nogen skal lære eder; men således som hans Salvelse
      lærer eder alt, er det også sandt og er ikke Løgn, og som den
      har lært eder, skulle I blive i ham.

 28.  Og nu mine Børn! bliver i ham, for at vi, når han åbenbares,
      kunne have Frimodighed og ikke skulle blive til Skamme for ham
      ved hans Tilkommelse.
 29.  Dersom I vide, at han er retfærdig, da erkender, at hver den,
      som gør Retfærdighed, er født af ham.

1.Johannes 3

  1.  Ser, hvor stor en Kærlighed Faderen har givet os, at vi skulle
      kaldes Guds Børn og vi ere det. Derfor kender Verden os ikke,
      fordi den ikke har kendt ham.
  2.  I elskede! nu ere vi Guds Børn, og det er endnu ikke åbenbaret,
      hvad vi skulle vorde. Vi vide, at når det åbenbares, da skulle
      vi vorde ham lige; thi i skulle se ham, som han er.
  3.  Og hver den, som har dette Håb til ham, renser sig selv, ligesom
      han er ren.
  4.  Hver den, som gør Synden, begår også Overtrædelse af Loven, og
      Synden er Lovens Overtrædelse.
  5.  Og I vide, at han blev åbenbaret for at han skulde borttage
      Synderne; og der er ikke Synd i ham
  6.  Hver den, som bliver i ham, synder ikke; hver den, som
      synder,har ikke set ham og kender ham ej heller.

  7.  Mine Børn, ingen forføre eder! Den, som gør Retfærdigheden, er
      retfærdig, ligesom han er retfærdig.
  8.  Den, som gør Synden, er af Djævelen; thi Djævelen har syndet fra
      Begyndelsen. Dertil blev Guds Søn åbenbaret, for at han skulde
      nedbryde Djævelens Gerninger.
  9.  Hver den, som er født af Gud, gør ikke Synd, fordi hans Sæd
      bliver i ham, og han kan ikke synde, fordi han er født af Gud.
 10.  Derved blive Guds Børn og Djævelens Børn åbenbare. Hver den, som
      ikke gør Retfærdighed, er ikke af Gud, og ligeså den, som ikke
      elsker sin Broder.
 11.  Thi dette er det Budskab, som I have hørt fra Begyndelsen, at vi
      skulle elske hverandre;
 12.  ikke som Kain, der var af den onde og myrdede sin Broder. Og
      hvorfor myrdede han ham? Fordi hans Gerninger vare onde, men
      hans Broders retfærdige.
 13.  Undrer eder ikke, mine Brødre! om Verden hader eder.
 14.  Vi vide, at vi ere gåede over fra Døden til Livet, thi vi elske
      Brødrene. Den, som ikke elsker, bliver i Døden.
 15.  Hver den, som hader sin Broder, er en Manddraber; og I vide, at
      ingen Manddraber har evigt Liv blivende i sig.
 16.  Derpå kende vi Kærligheden, at han har sat sit Liv til for os;
      også vi ere skyldige at sætte Livet til for Brødrene.
 17.  Men den, som bar Verdens Gods og ser sin Broder lide Nød og
      lukker sit Hjerte for ham, hvorledes bliver Guds Kærlighed i
      ham?

 18.  Mine Børn! lader os ikke elske med Ord, ej heller med Tungen,
      men i Gerning og Sandhed!
 19.  Og derpå kunne vi kende, at vi ere af Sandheden, og da kunne vi
      for hans Åsyn stille vore Hjerter tilfreds,
 20.  hvad end vort Hjerte måtte fordømme os for; thi Gud er større
      end vort Hjerte og kender alle Ting.
 21.  I elskede! dersom vort Hjerte ikke fordømmer os, have vi
      Frimodighed for Gud,
 22.  og hvad vi end bede om, det få vi af ham, fordi vi holde hans
      Bud og gøre det, som er velbehageligt for ham.
 23.  Og dette er hans Bud; at vi skulle tro hans Søns Jesu Kristi
      Navn og elske hverandre efter det Bud, han gav os.
 24.  Og den, som holder hans Bud, han bliver i Gud, og Gud i ham; og
      derpå kende vi, at han bliver i os; af den Ånd, som han gav os.

1.Johannes 4

  1.  I elskede! tror ikke enhver Ånd, men prøver Ånderne, om de ere
      af Gud; thi mange falske Profeter ere udgåede i Verden.
  2.  Derpå kende I Guds Ånd: enhver Ånd, der bekender Jesus som
      Kristus, kommen i Kød, er af Gud.
  3.  Og enhver Ånd, der ikke bekender Jesus, er ikke af Gud; og dette
      er Antikrists Ånd, om hvilken I have hørt, at den kommer, og den
      er allerede nu i Verden.
  4.  Mine Børn! I ere af Gud og have overvundet dem, fordi den, som
      er i eder, er større end den, som er i Verden.
  5.  De ere af Verden; derfor tale de af Verden, og Verden hører dem.
  6.  Vi ere af Gud. Den, som kender Gud, hører os; den, som ikke er
      af

  7.  I elskede! lader os elske hverandre, thi Kærligheden er af Gud,
      og hver den, som elsker, er født at Gud og kender Gud.
  8.  Den, som ikke elsker, kender ikke Gud, thi Gud er Kærlighed.
  9.  Deri blev Guds Kærlighed åbenbaret iblandt os, at Gud har sendt
      sin Søn, den enbårne, til Verden, for at vi skulle leve ved ham.
 10.  Deri består Kærligheden: ikke at vi have elsket Gud, men at han
      har elsket os og udsendt sin Søn til en Forsoning for vore
      Synder.
 11.  I elskede! har Gud således elsket os, da ere også vi skyldige at
      elske hverandre.
 12.  Ingen har nogen Sinde set Gud; dersom vi elske hverandre, bliver
      Gud i os, og hans Kærlighed er fuldkommet i os.
 13.  Derpå kende vi, at vi blive i ham, og han i os, at han har givet
      os af sin Ånd.
 14.  Og vi have skuet og vidne, at Faderen bar udsendt Sønnen til
      Frelser for Verden.
 15.  Den, som bekender, at Jesus er Guds Søn, i ham bliver Gud, og
      han i Gud.
 16.  Og vi have erkendt og troet den Kærlighed, som Gud har til
      os. Gud er Kærlighed, og den, som bliver i Kærligheden, bliver i
      Gud, og Gud i ham.
 17.  Deri er Kærligheden fuldkommet hos os, at vi have Frimodighed på
      Dommens Dag, fordi, ligesom han er, således ere også vi i denne
      Verden.
 18.  Frygt er ikke i Kærligheden, men den fuldkomne Kærlighed driver
      Frygten ud; thi Frygt bringer Straf; men den, som frygter, er
      ikke fuldkommet i Kærligheden.
 19.  Vi elske, fordi han elskede os først.
 20.  Dersom nogen siger: "Jeg elsker Gud," og hader sin Broder, han
      er en Løgner; thi den, der ikke elsker sin Broder, som han har
      set, hvorledes kan han elske Gud, som han ikke har set?
 21.  Og dette Bud have vi fra ham, at den, som elsker Gud, skal også
      elske sin Broder.

1.Johannes 5

  1.  Hver den, som tror, at Jesus er Kristus, er født af Gud; og hver
      den, som elsker Faderen, elsker også den, som er født af ham.
  2.  Derpå kende vi, at vi elske Guds Børn, når vi elske Gud og gøre
      hans Bud.
  3.  Thi dette er Kærlighed til Gud, at vi holde hans Bud; og hans
      Bud ere ikke svære;
  4.  thi alt det, som er født af Gud, overvinder Verden; og dette er
      den Sejr, som har overvundet Verden, vor Tro.
  5.  Hvem er den, som overvinder Verden, uden den, som tror, at Jesus
      er Guds Søn?

  6.  Han er den, som kom med Vand og Blod, Jesus Kristus; ikke med
      Vandet alene, men med Vandet og med Blodet; og det er Ånden, som
      viduer, thi Ånden er Sandheden.
  7.  Thi tre ere de, som vidne:
  8.  Ånden og Vandet og Blodet; og disse tre forene sig til eet.
  9.  Dersom vi tage imod Menneskenes Vidnesbyrd, da er Guds Søn.
 10.  Den, som tror på Guds Søn, har Vidnesbyrdet i sig selv; den, som
      ikke tror Gud, har gjort ham til en Løgner, fordi han ikke har
      troet på det Vidnesbyrd, som Gud har vidnet om sin Søn.
 11.  Og dette er Vidnesbyrdet, at Gud har givet os evigt Liv; og
      dette Liv er i hans Søn.
 12.  Den, som har Sønnen, har Livet; den, som ikke har Guds Søn, har
      ikke Livet.

 13.  Dette har jeg skrevet til eder, for at I skulle vide, at I have
      evigt Liv, I, som tro på Guds Søns Navn.
 14.  Og dette er den Frimodighed, som vi have over for ham, at dersom
      vi bede om noget efter hans Villie, hører han os.
 15.  Og dersom vi vide, at han hører os, hvad vi end bede om, da vide
      vi, at vi have de Ting, om hvilke vi have bedt ham.
 16.  Dersom nogen ser sin Broder begå Synd, som ikke er til Døden,
      han bede, og han skal give ham Liv, dem nemlig, som ikke synde
      til Døden.  Der er Synd til Døden; for den siger jeg ikke, at
      han skal bede.
 17.  Al uretfærdighed er synd, men der er synd, som ikke er til
      døden.

 18.  Vi vide, at hver den, som er født af Gud, synder ikke; men den,
      som er født af Gud, bevarer sig selv, og den onde rører ham
      ikke.
 19.  Vi vide, at vi ere af Gud, og hele Verden ligger i det onde.
 20.  Men vi vide, at Guds Søn er kommen, og han har givet os Forstand
      til at kende den sande; og vi ere i den sande, i hans Søn Jesus
      Kristus. Denne er den sande Gud og evigt Liv.
 21.  Mine Børn, vogter eder for Afguderne!


2.Johannes

  1.  Den Ældste til den udvalgte Frue og hendes Børn, som jeg elsker
      i Sandhed, og ikke jeg alene, men også alle, som have erkendt
      Sandheden,
  2.  for den Sandheds Skyld, som bliver i os og skal være med os til
      evig Tid.
  3.  Nåde, Barmhjertighed og Fred være med os fra Gud Fader og fra
      Jesus Kristus, Faderens Søn, i Sandhed og Kærlighed!

  4.  Jeg har glædet mig meget over, at jeg har fundet Børn af dig,
      som vandre i Sandhed, efter det Bud, vi fik af Faderen.
  5.  Og nu beder jeg dig, Frue! ikke som om jeg skrev til dig et nyt
  6.  Og dette er Kærligheden, at vi vandre efter hans Bud. Dette er
      Budet, således som I have hørt fra Begyndelsen, at I skulle
      vandre deri.

  7.  Thi mange Forførere ere udgåede i Verden, som ikke bekende Jesus
      som Kristus kommen i Kød. En sådan er Forføreren og Antikrist.
  8.  Giver Agt på eder selv, at I ikke skulle tabe, hvad vi have
      arbejdet, men at I må få fuld Løn.
  9.  Hver den, som viger ud og ikke bliver i Kristi Lære, har ikke
      Gud.  Den, som bliver i Læren, han har både Faderen og Sønnen.
 10.  Dersom nogen kommer til eder og ikke fører denne Lære, ham
      skulle I ikke tage til Huse og ikke byde velkommen.
 11.  Thi den, som byder ham velkommen, bliver delagtig i hans onde
      Gerninger.

 12.  Endskønt jeg havde meget at skrive til eder, har jeg ikke villet
      det med Papir og Blæk; men jeg håber at komme til eder og tale
      mundtligt med eder, for at vor Glæde må være fuldkommen.
 13.  Din Søsters, den udvalgtes, Børn hilse dig.


3.Johannes

  1.  Den Ældste til Kajus, den elskede, hvem jeg elsker i Sandhed.
  2.  Du elskede! jeg ønsker, at det i alle Ting må gå dig vel, og du
      må være karsk, ligesom det går din Sjæl vel.

  3.  Thi jeg blev meget glad, da der kom Brødre og vidnede om
      Sandheden i dig, hvorledes du vandrer i Sandheden.
  4.  Jeg har ingen større Glæde end denne, at jeg hører, at mine Børn
      vandre i Sandheden.
  5.  Du elskede! en trofast Gerning gør du i alt, hvad du virker for
      Brødrene, og det for femmede,
  6.  hvilke have vidnet for Menigheden om din Kærlighed; og du vil
      gøre vel i at fremme deres Rejse således, som det er Gud
      værdigt.
  7.  Thi for Navnets Skyld ere de dragne ud, uden at tage noget at
      Hedningerne.
  8.  Derfor ere vi skyldige at tage os af sådanne, for at vi kunne
      blive Medarbejdere for Sandheden.

  9.  Jeg har skrevet noget til Menigheden; men Diotrefes, som gerne
      vil være den ypperste iblandt dem, anerkender os ikke.
 10.  Derfor vil jeg, når jeg kommer erindre om de Gerninger, han gør,
      idet han bagvasker os med onde Ord; og ikke tilfreds dermed,
      tager han både selv ikke Brødrene for gode, og dem, som ville
      det, forhindrer han deri og udstøder dem af Menigheden.
 11.  Du elskede! efterfølg ikke det onde, men det gode. Den, som gør
      godt, er af Gud; den, som gør ondt, har ikke set Gud.

 12.  Demetrius har et godt Vidnesbyrd af alle og af Sandheden selv;
      også vi vidne, og du ved, at vort Vidnesbyrd er sandt.

 13.  Jeg havde meget at skrive til dig, men jeg vil ikke skrive til
      dig med Blæk og Pen.
 14.  Men jeg håber snart at se dig, og da skulle vi mundtligt tale
      sammen.
 15.  Fred være med dig! Vennerne hilse dig. Hils Vennerne, hver især!

Judas

  1.  Judas, Jesu Kristi Tjener og Broder til Jakob, til de kaldede,
      som ere elskede i Gud Fader og bevarede for Jesus Kristus:
  2.  Barmhjertighed og Fred og Kærlighed vorde eder mangfoldig til
      Del!

  3.  I elskede! da det lå mig alvorligt på Sinde at skrive til eder
      om vor fælles Frelse, fandt jeg det nødvendigt at skrive til
      eder med Formaning om at stride for den Tro, som een Gang er
      bleven overgiven de hellige.
  4.  Thi der har indsneget sig nogle Mennesker, om hvem det for længe
      siden er forud skrevet, at de vilde falde under denne Dom:
      Ugudelige, som misbruge vor, Guds Nåde til Uterlighed og
      fornægte vor eneste Hersker og Herre Jesus Kristus.

  5.  Men skønt I een Gang for alle vide det alt sammen, vil jeg minde
      eder om, at da Herren havde frelst Folket ud af Ægyptens Land,
      ødelagde han næste Gang dem, som ikke troede,
  6.  og de Engle, som ikke bevarede deres Højhed, men forlode deres
      egen Bolig, bar han holdt forvarede i evige Lænker under Mørke
      til den store Dags Dom;
  7.  ligesom Sodoma og Gomorra og de omliggende Stæder, der på samme
      Måde som disse vare henfaldne til Utugt og gik efter fremmed
      Kød), ere satte til et Eksempel, idet de bære en evig Ilds
      Straf.
  8.  Alligevel gå også disse ligedan i Drømme og besmitte Kød,
      foragte Herskab og bespotte Herligheder.
  9.  Men Overengelen Mikael turde, da han tvistedes med Djævelen og
      talte om Mose Legeme, ikke fremføre en Bespottelsesdom, men
      sagde: "Herren straffe dig!"
 10.  Disse derimod bespotte, hvad de ikke kende; og hvad de som de
      ufornuftige Dyr vide Besked om af Naturen, dermed ødelægge de
      sig selv.
 11.  Ve dem! thi de ere gåede på Kains Vej og have styrtet sig i
      Bileams Vildfarelse for Vindings Skyld og ere gåede til Grunde i
      Horas Genstridighed.
 12.  Disse ere Skærene ved eders Kærlighedsmåltider, fordi de uden
      Undseelse frådse med og pleje sig selv; de ere vandløse Skyer,
      som drives forbi af Vinden; bladløse Træer uden Frugt, to Gange
      døde, oprykkede med Rode;
 13.  vilde Bølger på Hav, som udskumme deres egen Skam; vild farende
      Stjerner; for dem er Mørke og Mulm bevaret til evig Tid.

 14.  Men om disse har også Enok, den syvende fra Adam, profeteret, da
      han sagde: "Se, Herren kom med sine hellige Titusinder
 15.  for at holde Dom over alle og straffe alle de ugudelige for alle
      deres Ugudeligheds Gerninger, som de have bedrevet, og for alle
      de formastelige Ord, som de have talt imod ham, de ugudelige
      Syndere!"
 16.  Disse ere de, som knurre, som klage over deres Skæbne, medens de
      vandre efter deres Begæringer, og deres Mund taler overmodige
      Ord, medens de for Fordels Skyld vise Beundring for Personer.

 17.  I derimod, I elskede! kommer de Ord i Hu, som forud ere talte af
      vor Herres Jesu Kristi Apostle;
 18.  thi de sagde eder: I den sidste Tid skal der være Spottere, som
      vandre efter deres Ugudeligheders Begæringer.
 19.  Disse ere de, som volde Splittelser, sjælelige, som ikke have
      Ånd.
 20.  I derimod, I elskede! opbygger eder selv på eders helligste Tro;
      beder i den Helligånd;
 21.  bevarer således eder selv i Guds Kærlighed, forventende vor
      Herres Jesu Kristi Barmhjertighed til evigt Liv.
 22.  Og revser nogle, når de tvivle,
 23.  frelser andre ved at udrive dem af Ilden, forbarmer eder over
      andre med Frygt, så I hade endog den af Kødet besmittede
      Kjortel.

 24.  Men ham, som er mægtig til at bevare eder fra Fald og fremstille
      eder for sin Herlighed ulastelige i Fryd,
 25.  den eneste Gud, vor Frelser ved vor Herre Jesus Kristus,
      tilkommer Ære og Majestæt, Vælde og Magt, forud for al Tid og nu
      og i alle Evigheder! Amen.


Aabenbaringen

Aabenbaringen 1

  1.  Jesu Kristi Åbenbaring, som Gud gav ham for at vise sine
      Tjenere, hvad der skal ske snart, og han sendte Bud ved sin
      Engel og fremstillede det i Billeder for sin Tjener Johannes,
  2.  som har vidnet om Guds Ord og Jesu Kristi Vidnesbyrd: Alt, hvad
      han har set.
  3.  Salig er den, som oplæser, og de, som høre Profetiens Ord og
      bevare det, som er skrevet i den; thi Tiden er nær.

  4.  Johannes til de syv Menigheder i Asien: Nåde være med eder og
      Fred fra ham, som er, og som var, og som kommer, og fra de syv
      Ånder, som ere foran hans Trone,
  5.  og fra Jesus Kristus, det troværdige Vidne, den førstefødte af
      de døde og Jordens Kongers Fyrste. Ham, som elsker os og har
      udløst os af vore Synder med sit Blod
  6.  og har gjort os til et Kongerige, til Præster for sin Gud og
      Fader: Ham være Æren og Magten i Evighedernes Evigheder! Amen.

  7.  Se, han kommer med Skyerne, og hvert Øje skal se ham, også de,
      som have gennemstunget ham, og alle Jordens Stammer skulle jamre
      ved hans Komme. Ja, Amen!
  8.  Jeg er Alfa og Omega, siger Gud Herren, han, som er, og som var,
      og som kommer, den Almægtige.

  9.  Jeg Johannes, eders Broder og meddelagtig i Trængselen og Riget
      og Udholdenheden i Jesus, var på den Ø, som kaldes Patmos, for
      Guds Ords og for Jesu Vidnesbyrds Skyld.
 10.  Jeg henryktes i Ånden på Herrens Dag, og jeg hørte bag mig en
      høj Røst som af en Basun, der sagde:
 11.  Hvad du ser, skriv det i en Bog, og send det til de syv
      Menigheder, til Efesus og til Smyrna og til Pergamus og til
      Thyatira og til Sardes og til Filidelfia og til Laodikea.
 12.  Og jeg vendte mig for at se Røsten, som talte med mig; og da jeg
      vendte mig, så jeg syv Guldlysestager
 13.  og midt imellem de syv Lysestager en, lig en Menneskesøn, iført
      en fodsid Kjortel og omgjordet om Brystet med et Guldbælte.
 14.  Men hans Hoved og Hår var hvidt som hvid Uld, som Sne; og hans
      Øjne som Ildslue;
 15.  og hans Fødder lignede skinnende Malm, når det gløder i Ovnen;
      og hans Røst var som mange Vandes Lyd;
 16.  og i sin højre Hånd havde han syv Stjerner; og af hans Mund
      udgik der et tveægget, skarpt Sværd, og hans Udseende var som
      Solen, når den skinner i sin Kraft.
 17.  Og da jeg så ham, faldt jeg ned for hans Fødder som død; og han
      lagde sin højre Hånd på mig og sagde:
 18.  Frygt ikke! Jeg er den første og den sidste og den levende; og
      jeg var død, og se, jeg er levende i Evighedernes Evigheder, og
      jeg har Dødens og Dødsrigets Nøgler.
 19.  Skriv derfor, hvad du så, både det, som er, og det, som skal ske
      herefter.
 20.  Dette er de syv Stjerners Hemmelighed, hvilke du har set i min
      højre Hånd, og de syv Guldlysestager: de syv Stjerner ere de syv
      Menigheders Engle, og de syv Lysestager ere syv Menigheder.

Aabenbaringen 2

  1.  Skriv til Menighedens Engel i Efesus: Dette siger han, som
      holder de syv Stjerner i sin højre Hånd, ham, som vandrer midt
      imellem de syv Guldlysestager:
  2.  Jeg kender dine Gerninger og dit Arbejde og din Udholdenhed, og
      at du ikke kan fordrage de onde; og du prøvede dem, som kalde
      sig selv Apostle og ikke ere det, og du har fundet, at de ere
      Løgnere;
  3.  og du har Udholdenhed, og du har døjet ondt for mit Navns Skyld
      og er ikke bleven træt.
  4.  Men jeg har det imod dig, at du har forladt din første
      Kærlighed.
  5.  Kom derfor i Hu, hvorfra du er falden, og omvend dig, og gør de
      forrige Gerninger; men hvis ikke, da kommer jeg over dig, og jeg
      vil flytte din Lysestage fra dens Sted, hvis du ikke omvender
      dig.
  6.  Dog, dette har du, at du hader Nikolaiternes Gerninger, som også
      jeg hader.
  7.  Den, som har Øre, høre, hvad Ånden siger til Menighederne! Den,
      som sejrer, ham vil jeg give at æde af Livets Træ, som er i Guds
      Paradis.

  8.  Og skriv til Menighedens Engel i Smyrna: Dette siger den første
      og den sidste, han, som var død og blev levende:
  9.  Jeg kender din Trængsel og din Fattigdom (dog, du er rig), og
      Bespottelsen fra dem, som kalde sig selv Jøder og ikke ere det,
      men ere Satans Synagoge.
 10.  Frygt ikke, for hvad du vil komme til at lide! Se, Djævelen vil
      kaste nogle af eder i Fængsel, for at I skulle fristes, og I
      skulle have Trængsel i ti Dage. Vær tro indtil Døden, så vil jeg
      give dig Livets Krone
 11.  Den, som har Øre, høre, hvad Ånden siger til Menighederne! Den,
      som sejrer, skal ingenlunde skades af den anden Død.

 12.  Og skriv til Menighedens Engel i Pergamus: Dette siger han, som
      har det tveæggede, skarpe Sværd:
 13.  Jeg ved, hvor du bor, der, hvor Satans Trone er; og du holder
      fast ved mit Navn og fornægtede ikke min Tro, i Antipas's, mit
      tro Vidnes Dage, han, som blev ihjelslået hos eder, der, hvor
      Satan bor.
 14.  Men jeg har noget lidet imod dig, at du har nogle hos dig, som
      holde fast ved Bileams Lære, der lærte Balak at sætte Snare for
      Israels Børn, for at de skulde spise Afgudsofferkød og bedrive
      Utugt.
 15.  Således har også du dem, som holde fast ved Nikolaiternes Lære
      på lignende Vis.
 16.  Omvend dig! Men hvis ikke, kommer jeg snart over dig og vil
      stride imod dem med min Munds Sværd.
 17.  Den, som har Øre, høre, hvad Ånden siger til Menighederne! Den,
      som sejrer, ham vil jeg give af den skjulte Manna, og jeg vil
      give ham en hvid Sten og på Stenen et nyt Navn skrevet, som
      ingen kender, uden den, der får det.

 18.  Og skriv til Menighedens Engel i Thyatira: Dette siger Guds Søn,
      der har Øjne som Ildslue, og hvis Fødder ere som skinnende Malm:
 19.  Jeg kender dine Gerninger og din Kærlighed og Tro og Tjeneste og
      Udholdenhed, ja, dine Gerninger, de sidste flere end de første.
 20.  Men jeg har imod dig, at du finder dig i Kvinden Jesabel, som
      kalder sig selv en Profetinde og lærer og forfører mine Tjenere
      til at bedrive Utugt og spise Afgudsofferkød.
 21.  Og jeg har givet hende Tid til at omvende sig, men hun vil ikke
      omvende sig fra sin Utugt.
 22.  Se, jeg kaster hende på Sygelejet og hendes Bolere i stor
      Trængsel, dersom de ikke omvende sig fra deres Gerninger.
 23.  Og hendes Børn vil jeg slå med Død, og alle Menighederne skulle
      kende, at jeg er den, som ransager Nyrer og Hjerter; og jeg vil
      give eder, hver efter eders Gerninger.
 24.  Men til eder, de øvrige, som ere i Thyatira, så mange som ikke
      have denne Lære, fordi de ikke kende Satans Dybder, som de kalde
      det, til eder siger jeg: Jeg lægger ingen anden Byrde på eder.
 25.  Kun skulle I holde fast ved det, I have, indtil jeg kommer.
 26.  Og den, som sejrer, og som indtil Enden tager Vare på mine
      Gerninger, ham vil jeg give Mag over Hedningerne;
 27.  og med en Jernstav skal han vogte dem, ligesom Lerkar
      sønderknuses, ligesom også jeg har modtaget det af min Fader;
 28.  og jeg vil give ham Morgenstjernen.
 29.  Den, som har Øre, høre, hvad Ånden siger til Menighederne!

Aabenbaringen 3

  1.  Og skriv til Menighedens Engel i Sardes: Dette siger han, som
      har de syv Guds Ånder og de syv Stjerner: Jeg kender dine
      Gerninger, at du har Ord for at leve og er dog død.
  2.  Bliv vågen og styrk det øvrige, som ellers vilde dø; thi jeg har
      ikke fundet dine Gerninger fuldkommede for min Gud.
  3.  Kom derfor i Hu, hvorledes du modtog og hørte, og bevar det og
      omvend dig! Dersom du altså ikke våger, skal jeg komme som en
      Tyv, og du skal ikke vide, i hvilken Time jeg kommer over dig.
  4.  Dog har du i Sardes nogle få Personer, som ikke have besmittet
      deres Blæder; de skulle vandre med mig i hvide Klæder, thi de
      ere værdige dertil.
  5.  Den, som sejrer, han skal således iføres hvide Klæder, og jeg
      vil ikke udslette hans Navn af Livets Bog, og jeg vil bekende
      hans Navn for min Fader og for hans Engle.
  6.  Den, som har Øre, høre, hvad Ånden siger til Menighederne!

  7.  Og skriv til Menighedens Engel i Filadelfia: Dette siger den
      hellige, den sanddru, han, som har Davids Nøgle, han, som lukker
      op, så ingen lukker i, og lukker i, så ingen lukker op:
  8.  Jeg kender dine Gerninger. Se, jeg bar givet dig, at der foran
      dig er en åbnet Dør, som ingen kan lukke; thi du har kun liden
      Kraft, og dog har du bevaret mit Ord og ikke fornægtet mit Navn.
  9.  Se, jeg lader komme nøgle af Satans Synagoge, som kalde sig selv
      Jøder og ikke ere det, men lyve. Se, jeg vil gøre, at de skulle
      komme og tilbede for dine Fødder og kende, at jeg har fattet
      Kærlighed til dig
 10.  Efterdi du har bevaret mit Ord om Udholdenheden, vil også jeg
      bevare dig ud af Fristelsens Stund, som skal komme over hele
      Jorderige for at friste dem, som bo på Jorden.
 11.  Jeg kommer snart! Hold fast ved det, du har, for at ingen skal
      tage din Krone.
 12.  Den, som sejrer, ham vil jeg gøre til en Søjle i min Guds
      Tempel, og han skal ikke mere gå ud derfra; og jeg vil skrive på
      ham min Guds Navn og min Guds Stads Navn, det nye Jerusalem, der
      kommer ned fra Himmelen fra min Gud, og mit nye Navn.
 13.  Den, som har Øre, høre, hvad Ånden siger til Menighederne!

 14.  Og skriv til Menighedens Engel i Laodikea: Dette siger han, som
      er Amen, det troværdige og sanddru Vidne, Guds Skabnings
      Begyndelse:
 15.  Jeg kender dine Gerninger, at du hverken er kold eller varm; gid
      du var kold eller varm!
 16.  Derfor, efterdi du er lunken og 'hverken varm eller kold, vil
      jeg udspy dig af min Mund;
 17.  fordi du siger: Jeg er rig og har vundet Rigdom og fattes intet;
      og du ved ikke, at du er den elendige og jammerlige og fattige
      og blinde og nøgne.
 18.  Jeg råder dig, at du af mig køber Guld, lutret i Ilden, for at
      du kan blive rig, og hvide Klæder, for at du kan klæde dig
      dermed, og din Nøgenheds Skam ikke skal blottes, og Øjensalve
      til at salve dine Øjne med, for at du kan se.
 19.  Alle dem, jeg elsker, dem revser og tugter jeg; vær derfor
      nidkær og omvend dig!
 20.  Se, jeg står før Døren og banker; dersom nøgen hører min Røst og
      åbner Døren, vil jeg gå ind til ham og holde Nadver med ham, og
      han med mig.
 21.  Den, som sejrer, ham vil jeg give at tage Sæde hos mig på min
      Trone, ligesom jeg har sejret og har taget Sæde hos min Fader på
      hans Trone.
 22.  Den, som har Øre, høre, hvad Ånden siger til Menighederne!

Aabenbaringen 4

  1.  Derefter så jeg, og se, der var en Dør åbnet i Himmelen, og den
      første Røst, hvilken jeg havde hørt som af en Basun, der talte
      med mig, sagde: Stig herop, og jeg vil vise dig, hvad der skal
      ske herefter.
  2.  Straks henryktes jeg i Ånden; og se, en Trone stod i Himmelen,
      og en sad på Tronen,
  3.  og den siddende var at se til ligesom Jaspissten og Sarder, og
      der var en Regnbue omkring Tronen, at se til ligesom Smaragd.
  4.  Og omkring Tronen var der fire og tyve Troner, og på Tronerne
      sad der fire og tyve Ældste, iførte hvide Klæder og med
      Guldkranse på deres Hoveder.
  5.  Og fra Tronen udgår der Lyn og Røster og Tordener, og syv
      Ildfakler brænde foran Tronen, hvilke ere de syv Guds Ånder.
  6.  Og foran Tronen er der som et Glarhav, ligesom Krystal, og midt
      for Tronen og rundt om Tronen fire levende Væsener, fulde af
      Øjne fortil og bagtil.

  7.  Og det første Væsen ligner en Løve; og det andet Væsen ligner en
      Okse; og det tredje Væsen har Ansigt som et Menneske; og det
      fjerde Væsen ligner en flyvende Ørn.
  8.  Og de fire Væsener have hvert især seks Vinger, rundt om og
      indadtil ere de fulde af Øjne; og uden Ophør sige de Dag og Nat:
      Hellig, hellig, hellig er Herren, Gud, den Almægtige, han, som
      var, og som er, og som kommer!
  9.  Og når Væsenerne give Ære og Pris og Tak til ham, som sidder på
      Tronen, ham, som lever i Evighedernes Evigheder,
 10.  da falde de fire og tyve Ældste ned for ham, som sidder på
      Tronen, og tilbede ham, som lever i Evighedernes Evigheder, og
      lægge deres Kranse ned for Tronen og sige:
 11.  Værdig er du, vor Herre og Gud, til at få Prisen og Æren og
      Magten; thi du har skabt alle Ting, og på Grund af din Villie
      vare de, og bleve de skabte.

Aabenbaringen 5

  1.  Og jeg så i hans højre Hånd, som sad på Tronen, en Bog,
      beskreven indeni og udenpå, forseglet med syv Segl.
  2.  Og jeg så en vældig Engel, som udråbte med høj Røst: Hvem er
      værdig til at åbne Bogen og bryde dens Segl?
  3.  Og ingen i Himmelen, ej heller på Jorden, ej heller under
      Jorden, formåede at åbne Bogen eller at se i den.
  4.  Og jeg græd såre, fordi ingen fandtes værdig til at åbne Bogen
      eller at se i den.
  5.  Og en af de Ældste sagde til mig: Græd ikke! se, sejret har
      Løven af Judas Stamme, Davids Rodskud, så han kan åbne Bogen og
      dens syv Segl.
  6.  Og jeg så, midt imellem Tronen med de fire Væsener og de Ældste
      stod et Lam, ligesom slagtet: det havde syv Horn og syv Øjne,
      hvilke ere de syv Guds Ånder, som ere udsendte til hele Jorden.
  7.  Og det kom og tog Bogen af hans højre Hånd, som sad på Tronen.

  8.  Og da det tog Bogen, faldt de fire Væsener og de fire og tyve
      Ældste ned for Lammet, holdende hver sin Harpe og Guldskåle
      fyldte med Røgelse, som er de helliges Bønner.
  9.  Og de sang en ny Sang og sagde: Du er værdig til at tage Bogen
      og åbne dens Segl, fordi du blev slagtet og med dit Blod købte
      til Gud Mennesker af alle Stammer og Tungemål og Folk og
      Folkeslag,
 10.  og du har gjort dem for vor Gud til et Kongerige og til Præster,
      og de skulle være Konger på Jorden.
 11.  Og jeg så, og jeg hørte rundt om Tronen og Væsenerne og de
      Ældste en Røst af mange Engle, og deres Tal var Titusinder Gange
      Titusinder, og Tusinder Gange Tusinder,
 12.  og de sagde med høj Røst: Værdigt er Lammet, det slagtede, til
      at få Kraften og Rigdom og Visdom og Styrke og Ære og Pris og
      Velsignelse!
 13.  Og hver Skabning, som er i Himmelen og på Jorden og under Jorden
      og på Havet, ja, alt, hvad der er i dem, hørte jeg sige: Ham,
      som sidder på Tronen, og Lammet tilhører Velsignelsen og Æren og
      Prisen og Magten i Evighedernes Evigheder!
 14.  Og de fire Væsener sagde: Amen! Og de Ældste faldt ned og
      tilbade.

Aabenbaringen 6

  1.  Og jeg så, da Lammet åbnede et af de syv Segl, og jeg hørte et
      af de fire Væsener sige som en Tordens Røst: Kom!
  2.  Og jeg så, og se en hvid Hest, og han, som sad på den, havde en
      Bue; og der blev givet ham en Krone, og han drog ud sejrende og
      til Sejer.
  3.  Og da det åbnede det andet Segl, hørte jeg det andet Væsen sige:
      Kom!
  4.  Og der udgik en anden Hest, som var rød; og ham, som sad på den,
      blev det givet at tage Freden bort fra Jorden, og at de skulde
      myrde hverandre; og der blev givet ham et stort Sværd.
  5.  Og da det åbnede det tredje Segl, hørte jeg det tredje Væsen
      sige: Kom! Og jeg så, og se en sort Hest, og han, der sad på
      den, havde en Vægt i sin Hånd.
  6.  Og jeg hørte ligesom en Røst midt iblandt de fire Væsener, som
      sagde: Et Mål Hvede for en Denar og tre Mål Byg for en Denar; og
      Olien og Vinen skal du ikke gøre Skade.
  7.  Og da det åbnede det fjerde Segl, hørte jeg en Røst af det
      fjerde Væsen sige: Kom!
  8.  Og jeg så, og se en grøngul Hest, og han, som sad på den, hans
      Navn var Døden, og Dødsriget fulgte med ham; og der blev givet
      dem Magt over Fjerdedelen af Jorden til at ihjelslå med Sværd og
      med Hunger og med Pest og ved Jordens vilde Dyr.

  9.  Og da det åbnede det femte Segl, så jeg under Alteret deres
      Sjæle, som vare myrdede for Guds Ords Skyld og for det
      Vidnesbyrds Skyld, som de havde.
 10.  Og de råbte med høj Røst og sagde: Hvor længe, Herre, du hellige
      og sanddru! undlader du at dømme og hævne vort Blod på dem, som
      bo på Jorden?
 11.  Og der blev givet dem hver især en lang, hvid Klædning, og der
      blev sagt til dem, at de skulde hvile endnu en liden Tid, indtil
      også Tallet på deres Medtjenere og deres Brødre blev fuldt,
      hvilke skulde ihjelslås ligesom de.

 12.  Og jeg så, da det åbnede det sjette Segl, da skete der et stort
      Jordskælv, og Solen blev sort som en Hårsæk, og Månen blev helt
      som Blod.
 13.  Og Himmelens Stjerner faldt ned på Jorden, ligesom et Figentræ
      nedkaster sine umodne Figen, når det rystes af et stærkt Vejr.
 14.  Og Himmelen veg bort, lig en Bog, der sammenrulles, og hvert
      Bjerg og hver Ø flyttedes fra deres Steder.
 15.  Og Kongerne på Jorden og Stormændene og Krigsøverstene og de
      rige og de vældige og hver Træl og fri skjulte sig i Hulerne og
      i Bjergenes Kløfter,
 16.  og de sagde til Bjergene og Klipperne: Falder over os og skjuler
      os for Hans Åsyn, som sidder på Tronen, og for Lammets Vrede!
 17.  Thi deres Vredes støre Dag er kommen; og hvem kan bestå?

Aabenbaringen 7

  1.  Og derefter så jeg fire Engle stå på Jordens fire Hjørner; de
      holdt ordens fire Vinde; for at ingen Vind skulde blæse over
      Jorden, ej heller over Havet, ej heller over noget Træ.
  2.  Og jeg så en anden Engel stige op fra Solens Opgang med den
      levende Guds Segl; og han råbte med høj Røst til de fire Engle,
      hvem det var givet at skade Jorden og Havet, og sagde:
  3.  Skader ikke Jorden, ej heller Havet, ej heller Træerne, førend
      vi have beseglet vor Guds Tjenere på deres Pander.
  4.  Og jeg hørte Tallet på de beseglede, hundrede og fire og
      fyrretyve Tusinde beseglede af alle Israels Børns Stammer:
  5.  af Judas Stamme tolv Tusinde beseglede, af Rubens Stamme tolv
      Tusinde, af Gads Stamme tolv Tusinde,
  6.  af Asers Stamme tolv Tusinde, af Nafthalis Stamme tolv Tusinde,
      af Manasses Stamme tolv Tusinde,
  7.  af Simeons Stamme tolv Tusinde, af Levis Stamme tolv Tusinde, af
      Issakars Stamme tolv Tusinde
  8.  af Sebulons Stamme tolv Tusinde, af Josefs Stamme tolv Tusinde
      og af Benjamins Stamme tolv Tusinde beseglede.

  9.  Derefter så jeg, og se en stor Skare, som ingen kunde tælle, af
      alle Folkeslag og Stammer og Folk og Tungemål, som stod for
      Tronen og for Lammet, iførte lange, hvide Klæder og med
      Palmegrene i deres Hænder;
 10.  og de råbte med høj Røst og sagde: Frelsen tilhører vor Gud, som
      sidder på Tronen, og Lammet!
 11.  Og alle Englene stode rundt om Tronen og om de Ældste og om de
      fire Væsener og faldt ned for Tronen på deres Ansigt og tilbade
      Gud og sagde:
 12.  Amen! Velsignelsen og Prisen og Visdommen og Taksigelsen og Æren
      og Kraften og Styrken tilhører vor Gud i Evighedernes Evigheder!
      Amen.
 13.  Og en af de Ældste tog til Orde og sagde til mig: Disse, som ere
      iførte de lange, hvide Klæder, hvem ere de? og hvorfra ere de
      komne?
 14.  Og jeg sagde til ham: Min Herre! du ved det. Og han sagde til
      mig: Det er dem, som komme ud af den store Trængsel, og de have
      tvættet deres Klæder og gjort dem hvide i Lammets Blod.
 15.  Derfor ere de foran Guds Trone og tjene ham Dag og Nat i hans
      Tempel; og han, som sidder på Tronen, skal opslå sit Telt over
      dem.
 16.  De skulle ikke hungre mere, ej heller tørste mere, ej heller
      skal Solen eller nogen Hede falde på dem.
 17.  Thi Lammet, som er midt for Tronen, skal vogte dem og lede dem
      til Livets Vandkilder; og Gud skal aftørre hver Tåre af deres
      Øjne.

Aabenbaringen 8

  1.  Og da det åbnede det syvende Segl, blev der Tavshed i Himmelen
      omtrent en halv Time.

  2.  Og jeg så de syv Engle, som stå for Guds Åsyn; og der blev givet
      dem syv Basuner.
  3.  Og en anden Engel kom og stillede sig ved Alteret med et
      Guldrøgelsekar, og der blev givet ham megen Røgelse, for at han
      skulde føje den til alle de helliges Bønner på Guldalteret foran
      Tronen.
  4.  Og Røgen af Røgelsen steg op, med de helliges Bønner, fra
      Engelens Hånd før Guds Åsyn.
  5.  Og Engelen tog Røgelsekarret og fyldte det med Ild fra Alteret
      og kastede den på Jorden; og der kom Torden og Røster og Lyn og
      Jordskælv.

  6.  Og de syv Engle, som havde de syv Basuner, gjorde sig rede til
      at basune.
  7.  Og den første basunede, og der kom Hagl og Ild, blandet med
      Blød, og blev kastet på Jorden; og Tredjedelen af Jorden blev
      opbrændt, og alt grønt Græs opbrændtes.
  8.  Og den anden 'Engel basunede, og det var, som et stort brændende
      Bjerg blev kastet i Havet; og Tredjedelen af Havet blev til
      Blod.
  9.  Og Tredjedelen af de Skabninger i Havet, som havde Liv, døde; og
      Tredjedelen af Skibene blev ødelagt.
 10.  Og den tredje Engel basunede, og fra Himmelen faldt der en stor
      Stjerne, brændende som en Fakkel, og den faldt på Tredjedelen al
      Floderne og på Vandkilderne.
 11.  Og Stjernens Navn kaldes Malurt; og Tredjedelen af Vandene blev
      til Malurt, og mange af Menneskene døde af Vandene, fordi de
      vare blevne beske.
 12.  Og den fjerde Engel basunede, og Tredjedelen af Solen og
      Tredjedelen af Månen og Tredjedelen af Stjernerne blev ramt, så
      at Tredjedelen af dem blev formørket, og Dagen mistede
      Tredjedelen af sit Lys og Natten ligeså.
 13.  Og jeg så, og jeg hørte en Ørn flyve midt oppe under Himmelen og
      sige med høj Røst: Ve, ve, ve dem, som bo på Jorden, for de
      øvrige Basunrøster fra de tre Engle, som skulle basune.

Aabenbaringen 9

  1.  Og den femte Engel basusnede, og jeg så en Stjerne, som var
      falden ned fra Himmelen på Jorden, og Nøglen til Afgrundens
      Brønd blev given den.
  2.  Og den åbnede Afgrundens Brønd, og en Røg steg op af Brønden,
      lig Røgen af en stor Ovn; og Solen og Luften blev formørket af
      Røgen fra Brønden.
  3.  Og fra Røgen udgik der Græshopper over Jorden, og der blev givet
      dem Magt, som Jordens Skorpioner have Magt.
  4.  Og der blev sagt til dem, at de ikke måtte skade Græsset på
      Jorden, ej heller noget grønt eller noget Træ, men kun de
      Mennesker, som ikke have Guds Segl på deres Pander.  5Og det
      blev dem givet ikke at dræbe dem, men at pine dem i fem Måneder;
      og Pinen, de voldte, var som Pinen af en Skorpion, når den
      stikker et Menneske.
  6.  Og i de Dage skulle Menneskene søge Døden og ikke finde den, og
      attrå at dø, og Døden flyr fra dem.
  7.  Og Græshoppeskikkelserne lignede Heste, rustede til Krig, og på
      deres Hoveder var der som Kroner, der lignede Guld, og deres
      Ansigter vare som Menneskers Ansigter,
  8.  og de havde Hår som Kvinders Hår, og deres Tænder vare som
      Løvers,
  9.  og de havde Pansere som Jernpansere; og Lyden af deres Vinger
      var som Lyd af Stridsvogne, når mange Heste fare ud til Kamp.
 10.  Og de have Haler, som ligne Skorpioners, og Brodde, og i deres
      Haler ligger deres Magt til at skade Menneskene i fem Måneder.
 11.  De have Afgrundens Engel til Konge over sig; hans Navn er på
      Hebraisk Abaddon, og på Græsk har han Navnet Apollyon.
 12.  Det første Ve er til Ende; se, der kommer endnu to Veer
      derefter.

 13.  Og den sjette Engel basunede, og jeg hørte en Røst fra de fire
      Horn på Guldalteret, som står for Guds Åsyn,
 14.  sige til den sjette Engel, der havde Basunen: Løs de fire Engle,
      som ere bundne ved den store Flod Eufrat.
 15.  Og de fire Engle bleve løste, som til den Time og Dag og Måned
      og År vare rede til at ihjelslå Tredjedelen af Menneskene.
 16.  Og Tallet på Rytterhærene var to Gange Titusinde Gange
      Titusinde; jeg hørte deres Tal.
 17.  Og således så jeg Hestene i Synet og dem, som sade derpå, hvilke
      havde ildrøde og sorteblå og svovlgule Pansere; og Hestenes
      Hoveder vare som Løvers Hoveder, og af deres Munde udgik Ild og
      Røg og Svovl.
 18.  Af disse tre Plager, af Ilden og Røgen og Svovlet, som udgik af
      deres Munde, blev Tredjedelen af Menneskene ihjelslået.'
 19.  Thi Hestenes Magt er i deres Mund og i deres Haler; thi deres
      Haler ligne Slanger, have Hoveder, og med dem gøre de Skade.
 20.  Og de øvrige Mennesker, som ikke bleve dræbte i disse Plager,
      omvendte sig ikke fra deres Hænders Gerninger, så de lode være
      at tilbede de onde Ånder og Afgudsbillederne af Guld og Sølv og
      Kobber og Sten og Træ, som hverken kunne se eller høre eller gå;
 21.  og de omvendte sig ikke fra deres Myrden eller fra deres
      Trolddom eller fra deres Utugt eller fra deres Tyveri.

Aabenbaringen 10

  1.  Og jeg så en anden vældige Engel komme ned fra Himmelen, svøbt i
      en Sky, og Regnbuen var på hans Hoved, og hans Ansigt var som
      Solen og hans Fødder som Ildsøjler,
  2.  og han havde i sin Hånd en lille åbnet Bog. Og han satte sin
      højre Fod på Havet og den venstre på Jorden.
  3.  Og han råbte med høj Røst, som en Løve brøler; og da han havde
      råbt, lode de syv Tordener deres Røster høre.
  4.  Og da de syv Tordener havde talt, vilde jeg til at skrive; og
      jeg hørte en Røst fra Himmelen, som sagde: Forsegl, hvad de syv
      Tordener talte, og nedskriv det ikke!

  5.  Og Engelen, som jeg så stå på Havet og på Jorden, opløftede sin
      højre Hånd imod Himmelen
  6.  og svor ved ham, som lever i Evighedernes Evigheder, som bar
      skabt Himmelen, og hvad deri er, og Jorden, og hvad derpå er, og
      Havet, og hvad deri er, at der ikke mere skal gives Tid;
  7.  men i de Dage, da den syvende Engels Røst lyder, når han skal
      til at basune, da er Guds skjulte Råd fuldbyrdet således, som
      han har forkyndt sine Tjenere Profeterne.

  8.  Og den Røst, som jeg havde hørt fra Himmelen, talte atter med
      mig og sagde: Gå hen, tag den lille åbnede Bog, som er i den
      Engels Hånd, der står på Havet og på Jorden.
  9.  Og jeg gik hen til Engelen og sagde til ham, at han skulde give
      mig den lille Bog. Og han sagde til mig; Tag og nedsvælg den! og
      den vil volde Smerte i din Bug, men i din Mund vil den være sød
      som Honning.
 10.  Og jeg tog den lille Bog af Engelens Hånd og nedsvælgede den; og
      den var i min Mund sød som Honning, men da jeg havde nedsvælget
      den, følte jeg Smerte i min Bug.
 11.  Og man sagde til mig: Du bør igen profetere om mange Folk og
      Folkeslag og Tungemål og Konger.

Aabenbaringen 11

  1.  Og der blev givet mig et Rør ligesom en Målestok, med de Ord:
      Stå op og mål Guds Tempel og Alteret og dem, som tilbede deri.
  2.  Men Forgården uden for Templet, lad den ude og mål den ikke, thi
      den er given til Folkeslagene; og de skulle nedtræde den hellige
      Stad i to og fyrretyve Måneder.

  3.  Og jeg vil give mine tvende Vidner, at de skulle profetere eet
      Tusinde, to Hundrede og tresindstyve Dage, klædte i Sække.
  4.  Disse ere de tvende Olietræer og de tvende Lysestager, som stå
      for Jordens Herre.
  5.  Og dersom nogen vil gøre dem Skade, udgår der Ild af deres Mund
      og fortærer deres Fjender; og dersom nogen vil gøre dem Skade,
      bør han således ihjelslås.
  6.  Disse have Magt til at lukke Himmelen, så at der ingen Regn skal
      falde i deres Profetis Dage; og de have Magt over Vandene til at
      forvandle dem til Blod og til at slå Jorden med al Slags Plage,
      så ofte de ville.
  7.  Og når de få fuldendt deres Vidnesbyrd, skal Dyret, som stiger
      op af Afgrunden, føre Krig imod dem og overvinde dem og ihjelslå
      dem.
  8.  Og deres Lig skal ligge på Gaden i den store Stad, som i åndelig
      Forstand kaldes Sodoma og Ægypten, der, hvor også deres Herre
      blev korsfæstet.
  9.  Og Mennesker af alle Folk og Stammer og Tungemål og Folkeslag
      skulle se på deres Lig i tre og en halv Dag og ikke tilstede, at
      deres Lig lægges i Grav.
 10.  Og de, som bo på Jorden, glæde sig over dem og fryde sig; og de
      sende hverandre Gaver, fordi disse to Profeter vare til Plage
      for dem, som bo på Jorden.
 11.  Og efter de tre og en halv Dags Førløb kom der Livs Ånde fra Gud
      i dem; og de støde på deres Fødder, og stor Frygt faldt på dem,
      som så dem.
 12.  Og de hørte en høj Røst fra Himmelen, som sagde til dem: Stiger
      herop! Og de stege op til Himmelen i Skyen, og deres Fjender så
      derpå.
 13.  Og i samme Stund skete der et stort Jordskælv, og Tiendedelen af
      Staden faldt, og syv Tusinde Personer bleve dræbte i
      Jordskælvet; og de andre bleve forfærdede og gave Himmelens Gud
      Ære.
 14.  Det andet Veer til Ende; se, det tredje Ve kommer snart.

 15.  Og den syvende Engel basunede, og der hørtes høje Røster i
      Himmelen, som sagde: Herredømmet over Verden er blevet vor
      Herres og hans Salvedes, og han skal være Konge i Evighedernes
      Evigheder.
 16.  Og de fire og tyve Ældste, som sidde for Guds Åsyn på deres
      Troner, faldt ned på deres Ansigter og tilbade Gud og sagde:
 17.  Vi takke dig, Herre Gud almægtige, du, som er, og som var, fordi
      du har taget din store Magt og tiltrådt dit Kongedømme,
 18.  og Folkeslagene vrededes, og din Vrede kom og Tiden til, at de
      døde skulle dømmes, og til at give Lønnen til dine Tjenere,
      Profeterne, og de hellige og dem, som frygte dit Navn, de små og
      de store, og til at ødelægge dem, som lægge Jorden øde.
 19.  Og Guds Tempel i Himmelen blev åbnet, og hans Pagts Ark kom til
      Syne i hans Tempel, og der kom Lyn og Røster og Tordener og
      Jordskælv og stærk Hagl.

Aabenbaringen 12

  1.  Og et stort Tegn blev set i Himmelen: en Kvinde, iklædt Solen og
      med Månen under sine Fødder og en Krans af tolv Stjerner på sit
      Hoved.
  2.  Og hun var frugtsommelig og skreg i Barnsnød, under Fødselsveer.
  3.  Og et andet Tegn blev set i Himmelen, og se, der var en stor,
      ildrød Drage, som havde syv Hoveder og ti Horn og på sine
      Hoveder syv Kroner.
  4.  Og dens Hale drog Tredjedelen af Himmelens Stjerner med sig og
      kastede dem på Jorden. Og Dragen stod foran Kvinden, som skulde
      føde, for at sluge hendes Barn, når hun havde født det.
  5.  Og hun fødte et Drengebarn, som skal vogte alle Folkeslagene med
      en Jernstav; og hendes Barn blev bortrykket til Gud og til hans
      Trone.
  6.  Og Kvinden flyede ud i Ørkenen,hvor hun har et Sted beredt fra
      Gud, for at man skal ernære hende der eet Tusinde, to Hundrede
      og tresindstyve Dage.

  7.  Og der blev en Kamp i Himmelen: Mikael og hans Engle gave sig
      til at kæmpe imod Dragen, og Dragen kæmpede og dens Engle.
  8.  Men de magtede det ikke, og deres Sted fandtes ikke mere i
      Himmelen.
  9.  Og den store Drage blev nedstyrtet; den gamle Slange, som kaldes
      Djævelen og Satan, som forfører den hele Verden, blev nedstyrtet
      på Jorden, og hans Engle bleve nedstyrtede med ham.
 10.  Og jeg hørte en høj Røst i Himmelen sige: Nu er Frelsen og
      Kraften og Riget blevet vor Guds, og Magten hans Salvedes; thi
      nedstyrtet er vore Brødres Anklager, som anklagede dem for vor
      Gud Dag og Nat.
 11.  Og de have overvundet ham i Kraft af Lammets Blod og i Kraft af
      deres Vidnesbyrds Ord; og de elskede ikke deres Liv, lige til
      Døden.
 12.  Derfor, fryder eder, I Himle, og I, som bo i dem! Ve Jorden og
      Havet! thi Djævelen er nedstegen til eder og har stor Vrede,
      fordi han ved, at han kun har liden Tid.

 13.  Og da Dragen så, at den var styrtet til Jorden, forfulgte den
      Kvinden, som havde født Drengebarnet.
 14.  Og den store Ørns tvende Vinger bleve givne Kvinden, for at hun
      skulde flyve til Ørkenen, til sit Sted, der hvor hun næres en
      Tid og Tider og en halv Tid, borte fra Slangen.
 15.  Og Slangen spyede Vand som en Flod ud af sin Mund efter Kvinden
      for at bortskylle hende med Floden.
 16.  Og Jorden kom Kvinden til Hjælp; og Jorden åbnede sin Mund og
      opslugte Floden, som Dragen havde udspyet af sin Mund.
 17.  Og Dragen vrededes på Kvinden og gik bort for at føre Krig imod
      de øvrige af hendes Sæd, dem, som holde Guds Bud og have Jesu
      Vidnesbyrd.

Aabenbaringen 13

 18.  Og jeg stod på Sandet ved Havet.

      (Kap.13.)


  1.  Og jeg så et Dyr stige op af Havet, som havde ti Horn og syv
      Hoveder, og på sine Horn ti Kroner, og på sine Hoveder
      Bespottelsens Navne.
  2.  Og Dyret, som jeg så, var ligt en Panter, og dets Fødder som en
      Bjørns, og dets Mund som en Løves Mund; og Dragen gav det sin
      Kraft og sin Trone og stor Magt.
  3.  Og jeg så et af dets Hoveder ligesom såret til Døden, og dets
      dødelige Sår blev lægt, og al Jorden fulgte undrende efter
      Dyret.
  4.  Og de tilbade Dragen, fordi den havde givet Dyret Magten; og de
      tilbade Dyret og sagde: Hvem er Dyret lig? hvem mægter at kæmpe
      imod det?
  5.  Og der blev givet det en Mund til at tale store Ord og
      Bespottelser, og der blev givet det Magt til at virke i to og
      fyrretyve Måneder.
  6.  Og det åbnede sin Mund til Bespottelser imod Gud, til at
      bespotte hans Navn og hans Telt, dem, som bo i Himmelen.
  7.  Og der blev givet det at føre Krig imod de hellige og at
      overvinde dem; og der blev givet det Magt over hver Stamme og
      Folk og Tungemål og Folkeslag.
  8.  Og alle, som bo på Jorden, skulle tilbede ham, enhver, hvis Navn
      ikke fra Verdens Grundlæggelse er skrevet i Lammets, det
      slagtedes, Livets Bog.
  9.  Dersom nogen har Øre, han høre!
 10.  Dersom nogen fører andre i Fængsel, han kommer selv i Fængsel;
      dersom nogen dræber med Sværd, han skal dræbes med Sværd. Her
      gælder det de helliges Udholdenhed og Tro.

 11.  Og jeg så et andet Dyr stige op af Jorden, og det havde to Horn
      ligesom et Lam og talte som en Drage.
 12.  Og det udøver hele det første Dyrs Magt for dets Åsyn og får
      Jorden og dem, som bo derpå, til at tilbede det første dyr, hvis
      dødelige Sår blev lægt.
 13.  Og det gør store Tegn, så at det endog får Ild til. at falde ned
      fra Himmelen på Jorden for Menneskenes Åsyn.
 14.  Og det forfører dem, som bo på Jorden, for de Tegns Skyld, som
      det blev givet det at gøre for Dyrets Åsyn, og siger til dem,
      som bo på Jorden, at de skulle gøre et Billede af Dyret, ham,
      som har Sværdhugget og kom til Live.
 15.  Og det fik Magt til at give Dyrets Billede Ånd, så at Dyrets
      Billede endog kunde tale og gøre, at alle de, der ikke vilde
      tilbede Dyrets Billede, skulde ihjelslås.
 16.  Og det får alle, både små og støre, både rige og fattige, både
      frie og Trælle, til at sætte sig et Mærke på deres højre Hånd
      eller på deres Pande,
 17.  for at ingen skal kunne købe eller sælge uden den, som har
      Mærket, Dyrets Navn eller dets Navns Tal.
 18.  Her gælder det Visdom! Den, som har Forstand, udregne Dyrets
      Tal; thi det er et Menneskes Tal, og dets Tal er 666.

Aabenbaringen 14

  1.  Og jeg så, og se, Lammet stod på Zions Bjerg, og med det
      hundrede og fire og fyrretyve Tusinde, som havde dets Navn og
      dets Faders Navn skrevet på deres Pander.
  2.  Og jeg hørte en Lyd fra Himmelen som en Lyd af mange Vande og
      som en Lyd af stærk Torden, og den Lyd, jeg hørte, var som at
      Harpespillere, der spillede på deres Harper.
  3.  Og de sang en ny Sang for Tronen og for de fire levende Væsener
      og de Ældste; og ingen kunde lære den Sang, uden de hundrede og
      fire og fyrretyve Tusinde, som ere løskøbte fra Jorden.
  4.  Dette er dem, som ikke have besmittet sig med Kvinder, thi de
      ere jomfruelige; dette er dem, som følge Lammet, hvor det
      går. Disse ere løskøbte fra Menneskene, en Førstegrøde før Gud
      og Lammet,
  5.  og i deres Mund er der ikke fundet Løgn; thi de ere ulastelige.

  6.  Og jeg så en anden Engel flyve midt oppe under Himmelen, som
      havde et evigt Evangelium at forkynde for dem, der bo på Jorden,
      og for alle Folkeslag og Stammer og Tungemål og Folk,
  7.  og han sagde med høj Røst: Frygter Gud og giver ham Ære, thi
      hans Doms Time er kommen, og tilbeder ham, som har gjort
      Himmelen og Jorden og Havet og Vandenes Kilder.
  8.  Og endnu en anden Engel fulgte, som sagde: Falden, falden er
      Babylon, den store, som har givet alle Folkeslagene at drikke af
      sin Utugts Harmes Vin.
  9.  Og en tredje Engel fulgte dem og sagde med høj Røst: Dersom
      nogen tilbeder Dyret og dets Billede og tager Mærke på sin Pande
      eller på sin Hånd,
 10.  så skal han drikke af Guds Harmes Vin, som er iskænket ublandet
      i hans Vredes Bæger; og han skal pines med Ild og Svovl for de
      hellige Engles og for Lammets Åsyn.
 11.  Og deres Pines Røg opstiger i Evighedernes Evigheder; og de have
      ikke Hvile Dag og Nat, de, som tilbede Dyret og dets Billede, og
      enhver, som tager dets Navns Mærke.

 12.  Her gælder det de helliges Udholdenhed, de, som bevare Guds Bud
      og Troen på Jesus.
 13.  Og jeg hørte en Røst fra Himmelen, som sagde: Skriv: Salige ere
      de døde, som dø i Herren herefter. Ja, siger Ånden, de skulle
      hvile fra deres Møje, thi deres Gerninger følge med dem.

 14.  Og jeg, så, og se en hvid Sky, og på Skyen sad der en lig en
      Menneskesøn med en Guldkrone på sit Hoved og en skarp Segl i sin
      Hånd.
 15.  Og en anden Engel gik ud fra Templet og råbte med høj Røst til
      ham, som sad på Skyen: Udsend din Segl og høst; thi Timen til at
      høste er kommen, fordi Jordens Høst er moden.
 16.  Og han, som sad på Skyen, lod sin Segl gå over Jorden, og Jorden
      blev høstet.

 17.  Og en anden Engel gik ud fra Templet i Himmelen; også han havde
      en skarp Segl.
 18.  Og fra Alteret gik en anden Engel ud, som havde Magt over Ilden;
      og han råbte med høj Røst til den, som havde den skarpe Segl, og
      sagde: Udsend din skarpe Segl og afskær Druerne af Jordens
      Vintræ; thi dets Druer ere modne.
 19.  Og Engelen lod sin Segl gå hen over Jorden og afskar Frugten på
      Jordens Vintræ og kastede den i Guds Harmes store Persekar.
 20.  Og Persekarret blev trådt uden for Staden, og der kom Blod ud af
      Persekarret op til Hestenes Bidsler, så langt som eet Tusinde og
      seks Hundrede Stadier.

Aabenbaringen 15

  1.  Og jeg så et andet Tegn i Himmelen, stort og vidunderligt: syv
      Engel som have de syv sidste Plager; thi med disse er Guds Harme
      fuldbyrdet.
  2.  Og jeg så som et Glarhav, blandet med Ild, og dem, som sejrende
      gik ud af Kampen med Dyret og dets Billede og dets Navns Tal,
      stående ved Glarhavet og holdende Guds Harper.
  3.  Og de sang Mose, Guds Tjeners, Sang, og Lammets Sang, og sagde:
      Store og vidunderlige ere dine Gerninger, Herre, Gud, du
      Almægtige!  retfærdige og sande' ere dine Veje, du Folkeslagenes
      Konge!
  4.  Hvem skulde ikke frygte dig, Herre! og prise dit Navn? Thi du
      alene er hellig; ja, alle Folkeslagene skulle komme og tilbede
      for dit Åsyn, fordi dine retfærdige Domme ere blevne åbenbarede.
  5.  Og derefter så jeg, og Vidnesbyrdets Tabernakels Tempel i
      Himmelen blev åbnet,
  6.  og de syv Engle, som havde de syv Plager, gik ud af Templet,
      iførte rent og skinnende Linklæde og omgjordede om Brystet med
      Guldbælter.
  7.  Og et af de fire levende Væsener gav de syv Engle syv Guldskåle
      fyldte med Guds Harme, han. som lever i Evighedernes Evigheder.
  8.  Og Templet fyldtes med Røg fra Guds Herlighed og fra hans Kraft;
      og ingen kunde gå ind i Templet, førend de syv Engles syv Plager
      fik Ende.

Aabenbaringen 16

  1.  Og jeg hørte en høj Røst fra Tempelet sige til de syv Engle: Går
      hen og udgyder Guds Harmes syv Skåle over Jorden!
  2.  Og den første gik hen og udgød sin Skål over Jorden, og der kom
      slemme og onde Bylder på de Mennesker, som havde Dyrets Mærke,
      og dem, som tilbade dets Billede.
  3.  Og den anden Engel udgød sin Skål i Havet, og det blev til Blod
      som af en død; og hver levende Sjæl i Havet døde.
  4.  Og den tredje Engel udgød sin Skål i Floderne og Vandkilderne,
      og de bleve til Blod.
  5.  Og jeg hørte Vandenes Engel sige: Retfærdig er du, som er, og
      som var, du hellige, fordi du har fældet denne Dom;
  6.  thi de have udøst helliges og Profeters Blod, og du har givet
      dem Blod at drikke; de ere det værd.
  7.  Og jeg hørte Alteret sige: Ja, Herre, Gud, du almægtige! sande
      og retfærdige ere dine Domme.
  8.  Og den fjerde Engel udgød sin Skål over Solen; og det blev givet
      den at brænde Menneskene med Ild.
  9.  Og Menneskene brændtes i stor Hede og bespottede Guds Navn, som
      har Magt over disse Plager; og de omvendte sig ikke til at give
      ham Ære.
 10.  Og den femte Engel udgød sin Skål over Dyrets Trone; og dets
      Rige blev formørket, og de tyggede deres Tunger af Pine.
 11.  Og de bespottede Himmelens Gud for deres Piner og for deres
      Bylder; og de omvendte sig ikke fra deres Gerninger.
 12.  Og den sjette Engel udgød sin Skål over den store Flod Eufrat;
      og dens Vand borttørredes, for at Vejen kunde beredes for
      Kongerne fra Solens Opgang.
 13.  Og jeg så, at der af Dragens Mund og af Dyrets Mund og af den
      falske Profets Mund udgik tre urene Ånder, som lignede Padder.
 14.  Thi de ere DæmonersÅnder, som gøre Tegn; og de gå ud til hele
      Jorderiges Konger for at samle dem til Krigen på Guds, den
      almægtiges, store Dag.
 15.  - Se, jeg kommer som en Tyv Salig er den, som våger og bevarer
      sine Klæder, så han ikke skal gå nøgen, og man skal se hans
      Skam. -
 16.  Og de samlede dem til det Sted,som kaldes på Hebraisk
      Harmagedon.
 17.  Og den syvende Engel udgød sin Skål i Luften; og fra Templet,
      fra Tronen udgik der en høj Røst, som sagde: Det er sket.
 18.  Og der kom Lyn og Røster og Tordener; og der blev et stort
      Jordskælv, hvis Mage ikke har været, siden der blev Mennesker
      til på Jorden, et sådant Jordskælv, så stort.
 19.  Og den store Stad blev til tre Dele, og Folkeslagenes Stæder
      faldt; og Gud kom det store Babylon i Hu for at give det Bægeret
      med sin Vredes Harmes Vin.
 20.  Og hver Ø flyede, og Bjerge bleve ikke fundne.
 21.  Og en stærk Hagl, centnertung, faldt ned fra Himmelen på
      Menneskene; og Menneskene bespottede Gud for Haglens Plage, thi
      dens Plage var meget stor.

Aabenbaringen 17

  1.  Og en af de syv Engle, som havde de syv Skåle, kom og talte med
      mig og sagde: Kom! jeg vil vise dig Dommen over den store Skøge,
      som sidder over mange Vande,
  2.  med hvem Jordens Konger have bolet, og de, som bo på Jorden, ere
      blevne drukne af hendes Utugts Vin.
  3.  Og han førte mig i Ånden ud i en Ørken; og jeg så en Kvinde
      siddende på et skarlagenfarvet Dyr, som var fuldt af
      Bespottelsens Navne; det havde syv Hoveder og ti Hor1m.
  4.  Og Kvinden var klædt i Purpur og Skarlagen og strålede af Guld
      og Ædelsten og Perler; hun havde et Guldbæger i sin Hånd, fuldt
      af Vederstyggeligheder og hendes Utugts Urenheder.
  5.  Og på hendes Pande var skrevet et Navn, en Hemmelighed: Babylon
      den store, Moderen til Jordens Skøger og Vederstyggeligheder.
  6.  Og jeg så Kvinden, drukken af de helliges Blod og af Jesu
      Vidners Blod; og jeg undrede mig i stor Forundring, da jeg så
      hende.

  7.  Og Engelen sagde til mig: Hvorfor undrede du dig? Jeg vil sige
      dig Hemmeligheden med Kvinden og med Dyret, som bærer hende, og
      som har de syv Hoveder og de ti Horn.
  8.  Dyret, som du så, har været og er ikke, og det skal stige op af
      Afgrunden og gå bort til Fortabelse; og de, som bo på Jorden,
      skulle undre sig, de, hvis Navne ikke ere skrevne i Livets Bog
      fra Verdens Grundlæggelse, når de se,at Dyret var og er ikke og
      skal komme.
  9.  Her gælder det den Forstand, som har Visdom. De syv Hoveder ere
      syv Bjerge, på hvilke Kvinden sidder,
 10.  og de ere syv Konger. De fem ere faldne, den ene er der, den
      anden er endnu ikke kommen, og når han kommer, skal han blive en
      liden Tid.
 11.  Og Dyret, som var og er ikke, er både selv en ottende og er en
      af de syv og farer bort til Fortabelse.
 12.  Og de ti Horn, som du så, ere ti Konger, som endnu ikke have
      fået Rige, men få Magt som Konger een Time sammen med Dyret.
 13.  Disse have eet Sind, og deres Kraft og Magt give de til Dyret.
 14.  Disse skulle føre Krig med Lammet, og Lammet skal sejre over dem
      - fordi det er Herrers Herre og Kongers Konge - og de: som ere
      med det, de kaldede og udvalgte og trofaste.
 15.  Og han sagde til mig: De Vande, som du så, der hvor Skøgen
      sidder, ere Folk og Skarer og Folkeslag og Tungemål.
 16.  Og de ti Horn, som du så, og Dyret, disse ville hade Skøgen og
      gøre hende øde og nøgen og æde hendes Kød og opbrænde hende med
      Ild.
 17.  Thi Gud har indgivet dem i deres Hjerte at gøre efter hans Sind
      og at handle af eet Sind og at give Dyret deres Kongemagt,indtil
      Guds Ord blive fuldbyrdede.
 18.  Og Kvinden, som du så, er den store Stad, som har Herredømme
      over Jordens Konger.

Aabenbaringen 18

  1.  Derefter så jeg en anden Engel stige ned fra Himmelen; han havde
      stor Magt, og Jorden blev oplyst af hans Herlighed.
  2.  Og han råbte med stærk Røst og sagde: Falden, falden er Babylon
      den store, og den er bleven Dæmoners Bolig og et Fængsel for
      alle Hånde urene Ånder og et Fængsel for alle Hånde urene og
      afskyede Fugle!
  3.  Thi af hendes Utugts Harmes Vin have alle Folkeslagene drukket,
      og Jordens Konger have bolet med hende, og Jordens Købmænd ere
      blevne rige af hendes Yppigheds Fylde.
  4.  Og jeg hørte en anden Røst fra Himmelen, som sagde: Går ud fra
      hende, mit Folk! for at I ikke skulle blive meddelagtige i
      hendes Synder og ikke rammes af hendes Plager.
  5.  Thi hendes Synder ere opdyngede indtil Himmelen, og Gud har
      kommet hendes Uretfærdigheder i Hu.
  6.  Betaler hende, som hun har betalt eder, og gengælder hende
      dobbelt efter hendes Gerninger; skænker hende dobbelt i det
      Bæger, som hun har iskænket.
  7.  Så meget, som hun har forherliget sig selv og levet i Yppighed,
      så meget skulle I give hende af Pine og Sørg! Fordi hun siger i
      sit Hjerte: Jeg sidder som en Dronning og er ikke Enke, og Sorg
      skal jeg ingenlunde se,
  8.  derfor skulle hendes Plager komme på een Dag: Død og Sorg og
      Hunger, og hun skal opbrændes med Ild; thi stærk er den Herre
      Gud, som har dømt hende.

  9.  Og Jordens Konger, som have bolet og levet yppigt med hende,
      skulle græde og hyle over hende, når de se Røgen af hendes
      Brand,
 10.  medens de stå langt borte af Frygt for hendes Pinsel og sige:
      Ve!  ve! du store Stad, Babylon, du stærke Stad, thi på een Time
      er din Dom kommen.
 11.  Og Jordens Købmænd græde og sørge over hende, fordi ingen mere
      køber deres Ladning:
 12.  Ladning af Guld og Sølv og Ædelsten og Perler og fint Linned og
      Purpur og Silke og Skarlagen og alle Hånde vellugtende Træ og
      alle Hånde Arbejde af Elfenben og alle Hånde Arbejde af kostbart
      Træ og af Kobber og Jern og Marmor,
 13.  og Kanelbark og Hårsalve og Røgelser og Salve og Virak og Vin og
      Olie og fint Mel og Hvede og Okser og Får og Heste og Vogne og
      Slaver, ja, Menneskesjæle.
 14.  Og den Frugt, din Sjæl lystedes ved, er vegen fra dig og alt det
      lækre og glimrende er forbi for dig, og man skal aldrig finde
      det mere.
 15.  De, som handlede dermed og ere blevne rige ved hende, skulle stå
      langt borte af Frygt for hendes Pinsel grædende og sørgende og
      sige:
 16.  Ve ve! den store Stad, som var klædt i fint Linned og Purpur og
      Skarlagen og strålede af Guld og Ædelsten og Perler; thi i een
      Time er så stor en Rigdom lagt øde.
 17.  Og alle Styrmænd og alle Skippere og Søfolk og alle, som arbejde
      på Havet, stode langt borte
 18.  og råbte, da de så Røgen af hendes Brand, og sagde: Hvor var der
      Mage til den store Stad?
 19.  Og de kastede Støv på deres Hoveder og råbte grædende og
      sørgende og sagde: Ve! ve! den store Stad, hvori alle, som havde
      Skibe på Havet, berigedes ved dens Pragt; thi i een Time er den
      bleven lagt øde.

 20.  Fryd dig over den, du Himmel, og I hellige og Apostle og
      Profeter!  fordi Gud har skaffet eder Ret over den.

 21.  Og en vældig Engel løftede en Sten som en stor Møllesten og
      kastede den i Havet og sagde: Således skal Babylon, den store
      Stad, nedstyrtes i Hast og ikke findes mere.
 22.  Og Lyd af Harpespillere og Sangere og Fløjtespillere og
      Basunblæsere skal ikke høres i dig mere; og ingen Kunstner i
      nogen Kunst skal findes i dig mere; og Lyd af Mølle skal ikke
      høres i dig mere;
 23.  og Lys af Lampe skal ikke skinne i dig mere, og Brudgoms og
      Bruds Røst skal ikke høres i dig mere, fordi dine Købmænd vare
      Jordens Stormænd, fordi alle Folkeslagene bleve forførte ved dit
      Trylleri.
 24.  Og i den blev Profeters og helliges Blod fundet og alle deres,
      som ere myrdede på Jorden.

Aabenbaringen 19

  1.  Derefter hørte jeg ligesom en høj Røst af en stor Skare i
      Himmelen, som sagde: Halleluja! Frelsen og Herligheden og
      Kraften tilhører vor Gud.
  2.  Thi sande og retfærdige ere hans Domme, at han har dømt den
      store Skøge, som fordærvede Jorden med sin Utugt, og krævet sine
      Tjeneres Blod af hendes Hånd.
  3.  Og de sagde anden Gang: Halleluja! og Røgen fra hende opstiger i
      Evighedernes Evigheder.
  4.  Og de fire og tyve Ældste og de fire levende Væsener faldt ned
      eg tilbade Gud, som sad på Tronen, og de sagde: Amen! Halleluja!
  5.  Og en Røst udgik fra Tronen og sagde: Lover vor Gud, alle hans
      Tjenere, I, som frygte ham, de små og de store!
  6.  Og jeg hørte som en Røst af en stor Skare og som en Lyd af mange
      Vande og, som en Lyd af stærke Tordener, der sagde: Halleluja!
      thi Herren, Gud, den almægtige, har tiltrådt Kongedømmet.
  7.  Lader os glæde og fryde os og give ham Æren; thi Lammets Bryllup
      er kommet, og hans Brud har gjort sig rede.
  8.  Og det blev givet hende at iføre sig skinnende, rent Linklæde;
      thi Linklædet er de helliges Retfærdshandlinger.
  9.  Og han siger til mig: Skriv: Salige ere de, som ere budne til
      Lammets Bryllups Nadver! Og han siger til mig: Disse ere de
      sande Guds Ord.
 10.  Og jeg faldt ned for hans Fødder for at tilbede ham, og han
      siger til mig: Gør det ikke! Jeg er din Medtjener eg dine
      Brødres, som have Jesu Vidnesbyrd; tilbed Gud! thi Jesu
      Vidnesbyrd er Profetiens Ånd.

 11.  Og jeg så Himmelen åben, og se en hvid Hest, og han, som sad på
      den, kaldes trofast og sanddru, og han dømmer og kæmper med
      Retfærdighed.
 12.  Men hans Øjne vare Ildslue, og på hans Hoved var der mange
      Kroner;han havde et Navn skrevet, hvilket ingen kender, uden han
      selv;
 13.  og han var iført en Kappe, dyppet i Blod, og hans Navn kaldes:
      Guds Ord.
 14.  Og Hærene i Himmelen fulgte ham på hvide Heste, iførte hvidt,
      rent Linklæde.
 15.  Og af hans Mund udgik der et skarpt Sværd, for at han dermed
      skulde slå Folkeslagene; og han skal vogte dem med en Jernstav,
      og han skal træde Guds, den almægtiges, Vredes Harmes Vinperse.
 16.  Og på Kappen, på sin Lænd har han et Navn skrevet: Kongers Konge
      og Herrers Herre.
 17.  Og jeg så en Engel stående i Solen, og han råbte med høj Røst og
      sagde til alle Fugle, som flyve midt oppe under Himmelen: Kommer
      og samler eder til Guds store Nadver
 18.  for at æde Kød af Konger og Kød af Krigsøverster og Kød af
      vældige og Kød af Heste og af dem, som sidde på dem, og Kød af
      alle, både frie og Trælle, små og store.
 19.  Og jeg så Dyret og Jordens Kongen og deres Hære samlede for at
      føre Krig imod ham, som sad på Hesten, og imod hans Hær.
 20.  Og Dyret blev grebet og med det den falske Profet, som havde
      gjort Tegnene for dets Åsyn, hvormed han havde forført dem, som
      toge Dyrets Mærke, og dem, som tilbade dets Billede; de bleve
      begge kastede levende i Ildsøen, som brænder med Svovl.
 21.  Og de andre bleve ihjelslåede med hans Sværd, som sad på Hesten,
      det, der udgik af hans Mund, og alle Fuglene bleve mættede at
      deres Kød.

Aabenbaringen 20

  1.  Og jeg så en Engel stige ned fra Himmelen, han havde Afgrundens
      Nøgle og en stor Lænke i sin Hånd.
  2.  Og han greb Dragen, den gamle Slange, som er Djævelen og Satan,
      og bandt ham for tusinde År
  3.  og kastede ham i Afgrunden og lukkede og forseglede over ham,
      for at han ikke mere skulde forføre Folkeslagene, førend de
      tusinde År vare til Ende; derefter skal han løses en lille Tid.
  4.  Og jeg så Troner, og de satte sig på dem, og Dommermagt blev
      given dem; og jeg så deres Sjæle, som vare halshuggede for Jesu
      Vidnesbyrds og for Guds Ords Skyld, og dem, som ikke havde
      tilbedt; Dyret eller dets Billede og ikke havde taget Mærket på
      deres Pande og på deres Hånd; og de bleve levende og bleve
      Konger med Kristus i tusinde År.
  5.  De øvrige af de døde bleve ikke levende, førend de tusinde År
      vare til Ende. Dette er den første Opstandelse.
  6.  Salig og hellig er den, som bar Del i den første Opstandelse;
      over disse har den anden Død ikke Magt, men de skulle være Guds
      og Kristi Præster og skulle være Konger med ham i de tusinde År.

  7.  Og når de tusinde År ere til Ende, skal Satan løses af sit
      Fængsel.
  8.  Og han skal gå ud for at forføre Folkeslagene ved Jordens fire
      Hjørner, Gog og Magog, for at samle dem til Krig; deres Tal er
      som Havets Sand.
  9.  Og de droge frem over Jordens Flade og omringede de helliges
      Lejr og den elskede Stad. Og Ild faldt ned fra Himmelen fra Gud
      og fortærede dem.
 10.  Og Djævelen, som forførte dem, blev kastet i Ild og Svovlsøen,
      hvor også Dyret og den falske Profet var; og de skulle pines Dag
      og Nat i Evighedernes Evigheder.

 11.  Og jeg så en stor, hvid Trone og ham, som sad derpå; for hans
      Åsyn flyede Jorden og Himmelen, og der blev ikke fundet Sted for
      dem.
 12.  Og jeg så de døde, de store og de små, stående for Tronen, og
      Bøger bleve åbnede; og en anden Bog blev åbnet, som er Livets
      Bog; og de døde bleve dømte efter det, som var skrevet i
      Bøgerne, efter deres Gerninger.
 13.  Og Havet afgav de døde, som vare i det; og Døden og Dødsriget
      afgave de døde, som vare i dem, og de bleve dømte, hver efter
      sine Gerninger.
 14.  Og Døden og Dødsriget bleve kastede i Ildsøen. Dette er den
      anden Død, Ildsøen.
 15.  Og dersom nogen ikke fandtes skreven i Livets Bog, blev han
      kastet i Ildsøen.

Aabenbaringen 21

  1.  Og jeg så en ny Himmel og en ny Jord; thi den forrige Himmel og
      den forrige Jord var veget bort, og Havet var ikke mere.
  2.  Og jeg så den hellige Stad, det nye Jerusalem, stige ned fra
      Himmelen fra Gud, beredt som en Brud, der er smykket før sin
      Brudgom.
  3.  Og jeg hørte en høj Røst fra Himmelen, som sagde: Se, Guds Telt
      er hos Menneskene, og han skal bo hos dem, og de skulle være
      hans Folk, og Gud selv skal være hos dem og være deres Gud.
  4.  Og han skal aftørre hver Tåre af deres Øjne, og Døden skal ikke
      være mere, ej heller Sorg, ej heller Skrig, ej heller Pine skal
      være mere; thi det forrige er veget bort.
  5.  Og han, som sad på Tronen, sagde: Se, jeg gør alle Ting nye. Og
      han siger til mig: Skriv; thi disse Ord ere troværdige og sande.
  6.  Og han sagde til mig: De ere skete. Jeg er Alfa og Omega,
      Begyndelsen og Enden. Jeg vil give den tørstige af Livets Vands
      Kilde uforskyldt.
  7.  Den, som sejrer, skal arve dette, og jeg vil være hans God, og
      han skal være min Søn.
  8.  Men de fejge og utro og vederstyggelige og Morderne og de
      utugtige og Troldkarlene og Afgudsdyrkerne og alle Løgnerne,
      deres Lod skal være i Søen, som brænder med Ild og Svovl; dette
      er den anden Død.

  9.  Og en af de syv Engle, som havde de syv Skåle, der vare fulde af
      de syv sidste Plager, kom og talte med mig og sagde: Kom, jeg
      vil vise dig Bruden, Lammets Hustru.
 10.  Og han førte mig i Ånden hen på et stort og højt Bjerg og viste
      mig den hellige Stad, Jerusalem, stigende ned fra Himmelen, fra
      Gud
 11.  med Guds Herlighed. Dens Glans var som den kostbareste Sten, som
      krystalklar Jaspissten.
 12.  Den havde en stor og høj Mur; den havde tolv Porte og over
      Portene tolv Engle og påskrevne Navne, hvilke ere Israels Børns
      tolv Stammers;
 13.  mod Øst tre Porte og mod Nord tre Porte og mod Syd tre Porte og
      mod Vest tre Porte.
 14.  Og Stadens Mur havde tolv Grundsten, og på dem Lammets tolv
      Apostles tolv Navne.
 15.  Og han, som talte med mig, havde en Målestok, et Guldrør, for at
      han skulde måle Staden og dens Porte og dens Mur.
 16.  Og Staden ligger i Firkant, og dens Længde er lige så stor som
      Bredden. Og han målte Staden med Røret: tolv Tusinde Stadier;
      dens Længde, Bredde og Højde ere lige.
 17.  Og han målte dens Mur, hundrede og fire og fyrretyve Alen, efter
      Menneskemål, hvilket er Englemål.
 18.  Og dens Murværk var Jaspis, og Staden var af rent Guld, lig det
      rene Glar.
 19.  Stadmurens Grundsten vare prydede med alle Hånde Ædelsten: den
      første Grundsten var Jaspis, den anden Safir, den tredje
      Kalkedon, den fjerde Smaragd,
 20.  den femte Sardonyks, den sjette Sarder, den syvende Krysolit,
      den ottende Beryl, den niende Topas, den tiende Krysopras, den
      ellevte Hyacint, den tolvte Ametyst.
 21.  Og de tolv Porte vare tolv Perler, hver af Portene var af een
      Perle, og Stadens Gade var rent Guld som gennemsigtigt Glar.
 22.  Og jeg så intet Tempel i den; thi dens Tempel er Herren, Gud,
      den almægtige, og Lammet.
 23.  Og Staden trænger ikke til Sol eller Måne til at skinne for den;
      thi Guds Herlighed oplyste den, og Lammet var dens Lys.
 24.  Og Folkeslagene skulle vandre i dens Lys, og Jordens Konger
      bringe deres Herlighed til den,
 25.  og dens Porte skulle ikke lukkes om Dagen; thi Nat skal ikke
      være der,
 26.  og de skulle bringe Folkeslagenes Herlighed og Ære til den.
 27.  Og intet urent skal komme ind i den, ej heller nogen, som øver
      Vederstyggelighed og Løgn; kun de, som ere skrevne i Lammets
      Livets Bog.

Aabenbaringen 22

  1.  Og han viste mig Livets Vands Flod, skinnende som Krystal,
      udvæld de fra Guds og Lammets Trone.
  2.  Midt i dens Gade og på begge Sider af Floden voksede Livets Træ,
      som bar tolv Gange Frugt og gav hver Måned sin Frugt; og Bladene
      af Træet tjente til Lægedom for Folkeslagene.
  3.  Og der skal intet bandlyst være mere; og Guds og Lammets Trone
      skal være i den, og hans Tjenere skulle tjene ham,
  4.  og de skulle se hans Ansigt, og hans Navn skal være på deres
      Pander.
  5.  Og Nat skal der ikke være mere, og de trænge ikke til Lys af
      Lampe eller Lys af Sol, fordi Gud Herren skal lyse over dem; og
      de skulle, være Konger i Evighedernes Evigheder.

  6.  Og han sagde til mig: Disse Ord ere troværdige og sande; og
      Herren, Profeternes Ånders Gud, har udsendt sin Engel for at
      vise sine Tjenere, hvad der skal ske snart.
  7.  Og se, jeg kommer snart. Salig er den, som bevarer denne Bogs
      Profetis Ord.
  8.  Og jeg, Johannes, er den, som så og hørte disse Ting, og da jeg
      havde hørt og set, faldt jeg ned for at tilbede for den Engels
      Fødder, som viste mig disse Ting.
  9.  Og han siger til mig: Gør det ikke; jeg er din Medtjener og dine
      Brødres, Profeternes, og deres, som bevare denne Bogs Ord;
      tilbed Gud!
 10.  Og han siger til mig: Du skal ikke forsegle denne Bogs Profetis
      Ord, thi Tiden er nær.
 11.  Lad den som gør Uret, fremdeles gøre Uret, og den urene
      fremdeles blive uren, og den retfærdige fremdeles øve
      Retfærdighed, og den hellige fremdeles blive helliggjort.
 12.  Se, jeg kommer snart, og min Løn er med mig til at betale
      enhver, efter som hans Gerning er.
 13.  Jeg er Alfa og Omega, den første og den sidste, Begyndelsen og
      Enden.
 14.  Salige ere de, som tvætte deres Klædebon, for at de kunne få
      Adgang til Livets Træ og gå ind igennem Portene i Staden.
 15.  Udenfor ere Hundene og Troldkarlene og de utugtige og Morderne
      og Afgudsdyrkerne og enhver, som elsker og øver Løgn.
 16.  Jeg, Jesus, har sendt min Engel til at vidne for eder disse Ting
      om Menighederne, jeg er Davids Rodskud og Slægt, den strålende
      Morgenstjerne.
 17.  Og Ånden og Bruden sige: Kom! Og den, som hører, sige: Kom! Og
      den, som tørster, han komme; den, som vil, han modtage Livets
      Vand uforskyldt!
 18.  Jeg vidner for enhver, som hører denne Bogs Profetis Ord: Dersom
      nogen lægger noget til disse Ting, da skal Gud lægge på ham de
      Plager, som der er skrevet om i denne Bog.
 19.  Og dersom nogen tager noget bort fra denne Profetis Bogs Ord, da
      skal Gud tage hans Lod bort fra Livets Træ og fra den hellige
      Stad, om hvilke der er skrevet i denne Bog.
 20.  Han, som vidner disse Ting, siger: Ja, jeg kommer snart! Amen.
      Kom, Herre Jesus!
 21.  Den Herres Jesu Nåde være med alle!

THE HISTORY OF TOM THUMB

It is said that in the days of the famed Prince Arthur, who was king of
Britain, in the year 516, there lived a great magician, called Merlin,
the most learned and skilful enchanter in the world at that time.

This great magician, who could assume any form he pleased, was
travelling in the disguise of a poor beggar, and being very much
fatigued, he stopped at the cottage of an honest ploughman to rest
himself, and asked for some refreshment.

The countryman gave him a hearty welcome, and his wife, who was a very
good-hearted, hospital woman, soon brought him some milk in a wooden
bowl, an some coarse brown bread on a platter.

Merlin was much pleased with this homely repast and the kindness of
the ploughman and his wife; but he could not help seeing that though
everything was neat and comfortable in the cottage, they seemed both
be sad and much cast down. He therefore questioned them on the cause
of their sadness, and learned they were miserable because they had no
children.

The poor woman declared, with tears in her eyes, that she should be the
happiest creature in the world if she had a son; and although he was no
bigger than her husband's thumb, she would be satisfied.

Merlin was so much amused with the idea of a boy no bigger than a man's
thumb, that he made up his mind to pay a visit to the queen of the
fairies, and ask her to grant the poor woman's wish. The droll fancy of
such a little person among the human race pleased the fairy queen
too, greatly, and she promised Merlin that the wish should be granted.
Accordingly, a short time after, the ploughman's wife had a son, who,
wonderful to relate! was not bigger than his father's thumb.

The fairy queen, wishing to see the little fellow thus born into the
world, came in at the window while the mother was sitting up in bed
admiring him. The queen kissed the child, and, giving it the name of Tom
Thumb, sent for some of the fairies, who dressed her little favorite as
she bade them.

   "An oak-leaf hat he had for his crown;
      His shirt of web by spiders spun;
   With jacket wove of thistle's down;
      His trowsers were of feathers done.

   His stockings, of apple-rind they tie
   With eyelash from his mother's eye:
   His shoes were made of mouse's skin
   Tann'd with the downy hair within."

It is remarkable that Tom never grew any larger than his father's thumb,
which was only of an ordinary size; but as he got older he became very
cunning and full of tricks. When he was old enough to play with the
boys, and had lost all his own cherry-stones, he used to creep into
the bags of his playfellows, fill his pockets, and, getting out unseen,
would again join in the game.

One day, however, as he was coming out of a bag of cherrystones, where
he had been pilfering as usual, the boy to whom it belonged chanced to
see him. "Ah, ha! my little Tommy," said the boy, "so I have caught you
stealing my cherrystones at last, and you shall be rewarded for your
thievish tricks." On saying this, he drew the string tight around his
neck, and gave the bag such a hearty shake, that poor little Tom's legs,
thighs, and body were sadly bruised. He roared out in pain, and begged
to be let out, promising never to be guilty of such bad practices again.

A short time afterwards his mother was making a batter-pudding, and Tom
being very anxious to see how it was made, climbed up to the edge of the
bowl; but unfortunately his foot slipped and he plumped over head and
ears into the batter, unseen by his mother, who stirred him into the
pudding-bag, and put him in the pot to boil.

The batter had filled Tom's mouth, and prevented him from crying; but,
on feeling the hot water, he kicked and struggled so much in the pot,
that his mother thought that the pudding was bewitched, and, instantly
pulling it out of the pot, she threw it to the door. A poor tinker, who
was passing by, lifted up the pudding, and, putting it into his budget,
he then walked off. As Tom had now got his mouth cleared of the batter,
he then began to cry aloud, which so frightened the tinker that he flung
down the pudding and ran away. The pudding being broke to pieces by the
fall, Tom crept out covered over with the batter, and with difficulty
walked home. His mother, who was very sorry to see her darling in such
a woeful state, put him into a tea-cup, and soon washed off the batter;
after which she kissed him, and laid him in bed.

Soon after the adventure of the pudding, Tom's mother went to milk her
cow in the meadow, and she took him along with her. As the wind was very
high, fearing lest he should be blown away, she tied him to a thistle
with a piece of fine thread. The cow soon saw the oak-leaf hat, and,
liking the look of it, took poor Tom and the thistle at one mouthful.
While the cow was chewing the thistle Tom was afraid of her great teeth,
which threatened to crush him in pieces, and he roared out as loud as he
could:

"Mother, mother!"

"Where are you, Tommy, my dear Tommy?" said his mother.

"Here, mother," replied he, "in the red cow's mouth."

His mother began to cry and wring her hands; but the cow, surprised
at the odd noise in her throat, opened her mouth and let Tom drop out.
Fortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to the
ground, or he would have been dreadfully hurt. She then put Tom in her
bosom and ran home with him.

Tom's father made him a whip of barley straw to drive the cattle with,
and having one day gone into the fields, he slipped a foot and rolled
into the furrow. A raven, which was flying over, picked him up and flew
with him to the top of a giant's castle that was near the seaside, and
there left him.

Tom was in a dreadful state, and did not know what to do; but he was
soon more dreadfully frightened; for old Grumbo, the giant, came up to
walk on the terrace, and seeing Tom, he took him up and swallowed him
like a pill.

The giant had no sooner swallowed Tom than he began to repent what he
had done; for Tom began to kick and jump about so much that he felt very
uncomfortable, and at last threw him up again into the sea. A large
fish swallowed Tom the moment he fell into the sea, which was soon after
caught, and bought for the table of King Arthur. When they opened the
fish in order to cook it, every on was astonished at finding such a
little boy, and Tom was quite delighted to be out again. They carried
him to the king, who made Tom his dwarf, and he soon grew a great
favorite at court: for by his tricks and gambols he not only amused the
king and queen, but also all the knights of the Round Table.

It is said that when the kind rode out on horseback he often took
Tom along with him, and if a shower came on he used to creep into his
majesty's waistcoat pocket, where he slept till the rain was over.

King Arthur one day asked Tom about his parents, wishing to know if they
were as small as he was, and whether rich or poor. Tom told the king
that his father and mother were as tall as any of the persons about
the court, but rather poor. On hearing this the king carried Tom to the
treasure, the place where he kept all his money, and told him to take
as much money as he could carry home to his parents, which made the poor
little fellow caper with joy. Tom went immediately to fetch a purse,
which was made of a water-bubble, and then returned to the treasury,
where he got a silver three-penny-piece to put into it.

Our little hero had some trouble in lifting the burden upon his back;
but he at last succeeded in getting it placed to his mind, and set
forward on his journey. However, without meeting with any accidents, and
after resting himself more than a hundred times by the way, in two days
and two nights he reached his father's house in safety.

Tom had travelled forty-eight hours with a huge silver-piece on his
back, and was almost tired to death, when his mother ran out to meet
him, and carried him into the house.

Tom's parents were both happy to see him, and the more so as he had
brought such an amazing sum of money with him; but the poor little
fellow was excessively wearied, having travelled half a mile in
forty-eight hours, with a huge silver three-penny-piece on his back.
His mother, in order to recover him, placed him in a walnut shell by the
fireside, and feasted him for three days on a hazel nut, which made him
very sick; for a whole nut used to serve him a month.

Tom was soon well again; but as there had been a fall of rain, and the
ground was very wet, he could not travel back to King Arthur's court;
therefore his mother, one day when the wind was blowing in that
direction, made a little parasol of cambric paper, and tying Tom to it,
she gave him a puff into the air with her mouth, which soon carried him
to the king's palace.

Just at the time when Tom came flying across the courtyard, the cook
happened to be passing with the king's great bowl of furmenty, which was
a dish his majesty was very fond of; but unfortunately the poor little
fellow fell plump into the middle of it, and splashed the hot furmenty
about the cook's face.

The cook, who was an ill-natured fellow, being in a terrible rage at Tom
for frightening and scalding him with the furmenty, went straight to the
king, and said that Tom had jumped into the royal furmenty, and thrown
it down out of mere mischief. The king was so enraged when he heard
this, that he ordered Tom to be seized and tried for high treason; and
there being no person who dared to plead for him, he was condemned to be
beheaded immediately.

On hearing this dreadful sentence pronounced, poor Tom fell a-trembling
with fear, but, seeing no means of escape, and observing a miller close
to him gaping with his great mouth, as country boobies do at a far, he
took a leap, and fairly jumped down his throat. This exploit was done
with such activity that not one person present saw it, and even the
miller did not know the trick which Tom had played upon him. Now, as
Tom had disappeared, the court broke up, and the miller went home to his
mill.

When Tom heard the mill at work he knew he was clear of the court, and
therefore he began to tumble and roll about, so that the poor miller
could get no rest, thinking he was bewitched; so he sent for a doctor.
When the doctor came, Tom began to dance and sing; and the doctor, being
as much frightened as the miller, sent in haste for five other doctors
and twenty learned men.

When they were debating about this extraordinary case, the miller
happened to yawn, when Tom, seizing the chance, made another jump, and
alighted safely upon his feet in the middle of the table.

The miller, who was very much provoked at being tormented by such a
little pygmy creature, fell into a terrible rage, and, laying hold of
Tom, ran to the king with him; but his majesty, being engaged with state
affairs, ordered him to be taken away and kept in custody till he sent
for him.

The cook was determined that Tom should not slip out of his hands this
time, so he put him into a mouse-trap, and left him to peep through the
wires. Tom had remained in the trap a whole week, when he was sent for
by King Arthur, who pardoned him for throwing down the furmenty,
and took him again into favor. On account of his wonderful feats of
activity, Tom was knighted by the king, and went under the name of the
renowned Sir Thomas Thumb. As Tom's clothes had suffered much in the
batter-pudding, the furmenty, and the insides of the giant, miller, and
fishes, his majesty ordered him a new suit of clothes, and to be mounted
as a knight.

   "Of Butterfly's wings his shirt was made,
      His boots of chicken's hide;
   And by a nimble fairy blade,
      Well learned in the tailoring trade,

      His clothing was supplied.--
   A needle dangled by his side;
   A dapper mouse he used to ride,
   Thus strutted Tom in stately pride!"

  It was certainly very diverting to see Tom in this dress, and
mounted on the mouse, as he rode out a-hunting with the king and
nobility, who were all ready to expire with laughter at Tom and his fine
prancing charger.

One day, as they were riding by a farmhouse, a large cat, which was
lurking about the door, made a spring, and seized both Tom and his
mouse. She then ran up a tree with them, and was beginning to devour the
mouse; but Tom boldly drew his sword, and attacked the cat so fiercely
that she let them both fall, when one of the nobles caught him in his
hat, and laid him on a bed of down, in a little ivory cabinet.

The queen of fairies came soon after to pay Tom a visit, and carried him
back to Fairy-land, where he lived several years. During his residence
there, King Arthur, and all the persons who knew Tom, had died; and as
he was desirous of being again at court, the fairy queen, after dressing
him in a suit of clothes, sent him flying through the air to the palace,
in the days of king Thunstone, the successor of Arthur. Every one
flocked round to see him, and being carried to the king, he was asked
who he was--whence he came--and where he lived? Tom answered:

   "My name is Tom Thumb,
   From the fairies I've come.
   When King Arthur shone,
   His court was my home.
   In me he delighted,
   By him I was knighted;
   Did you never hear of Sir Thomas Thumb?"

The king was so charmed with this address that he ordered a little
chair to be made, in order that Tom might sit upon his table, and also
a palace of gold, a span high, with a door an inch wide, to live in. He
also gave him a coach, drawn by six small mice.

The queen was so enraged at the honor paid to Sir Thomas that she
resolved to ruin him, and told the king that the little knight had been
saucy to her.

The king sent for Tom in great haste, but being fully aware of the
danger of royal anger, he crept into an empty snail-shell, where he lay
for a long time, until he was almost starved with hunger; but at last he
ventured to peep out, and seeing a fine large butterfly on the ground,
near his hiding-place, he approached very cautiously, and getting
himself placed astride on it, was immediately carried up into the air.
The butterfly flew with him from tree to tree and from field to field,
and at last returned to the court, where the king and nobility all
strove to catch him; but at last poor Tom fell from his seat into a
watering-pot, in which he was almost drowned.

When the queen saw him she was in a rage, and said he should be
beheaded; and he was again put into a mouse-trap until the time of his
execution.

However, a cat, observing something alive in the trap, patted it about
till the wires broke, and set Thomas at liberty.

The king received Tom again into favor, which he did not live to enjoy,
for a large spider one day attacked him; and although he drew his sword
and fought well, yet the spider's poisonous breath at last overcame him;

   "He fell dead on the ground where he stood,
   and the spider suck'd every drop of his blood."

King Thunstone and his whole court were so sorry at the loss of their
little favorite, that they went into mourning, and raised a fine white
marble monument over his grave, with the following epitaph:

   "Here lyes Tom Thumb, King Arthur's knight,
   Who died by a spider's cruel bite.
   He was well known in Arthur's court,
   Where he afforded gallant sport;
   He rode at tilt and tournament,
   And on a mouse a-hunting went.
   Alive he filled the court with mirth;
   His death to sorrow soon gave birth.
   Wipe, wipe your eyes, and shake your head,
   And cry,--Alas!  Tom Thumb is dead!"

THE CAT AND THE MOUSE

   The cat and the mouse
      Played in the malt-house:

The cat bit the mouse's tail off. "Pray, puss, give me my tail." "No,"
says the cat, "I'll not give you your tail, till you go to the cow and
fetch me some milk."

   First she leapt, and then she ran,
   Till she came to the cow, and thus began,--

"Pray, cow, give me milk, that I may give cat milk, that cat may give me
my own tail again." "No," said the cow, "I will give you no milk, till
you go to the farmer and get me some hay."

   First she leapt, and then she ran,
   Till she came to the farmer, and thus began,--

"Pray, farmer, give me hay that I may give cow hay, that cow may give me
milk, that I may give cat milk, that cat may give me my own tail again."

"No," says the farmer, "I'll give you no hay, till you go to the butcher
and fetch me some meat."

   First she leapt, and then she ran,
   Till she came to the butcher, and thus began,--

"Pray, butcher, give me meat, that I may give farmer meat, that farmer
may give me hay, that I may give cow hay, that cow may give me milk,
that I may give cat milk, that cat may give me my own tail again."

"No," says the butcher, "I'll give you no meat till you go to the baker
and fetch me some bread."

   First she leapt, and then she ran,
   Till she came to the baker, and thus began,--

"Pray, baker, give me bread, that I may give butcher bread, that butcher
may give me meat, that I may give farmer meat, that farmer may give me
hay, that I may give cow hay, that cow may give me milk, that I may give
cat milk, that cat may give me my own tail again."

   "Yes," says the baker, "I'll give you some bread,
   But if you eat my meal, I'll cut off your head."

Then the baker gave mouse bread, and mouse gave butcher bread, and
butcher gave mouse meat, and mouse gave farmer meat, and farmer gave
mouse hay, and mouse gave cow hay, and cow gave mouse milk, and mouse
gave cat milk, and cat gave mouse her own tail again!

FIRE! FIRE! BURN STICK!

And old woman was sweeping her house, and she found a little crooked
sixpence. "What," said she, "shall I do with this little sixpence? I
will go to market and buy a little pig." As she was coming home she came
to a stile; the piggy would not go over the stile.

She went a little farther, and she met a dog. So she said to the dog,
"Dog! bit pig; piggy won't go over the stile, and I shan't get home
to-night." But the dog would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a stick. So she said, "Stick!
stick! beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile, and
I shan't get home to-night." But the stick would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a fire. So she said, "Fire! fire!
burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get
over the stile, and I shan't get home to-night." But the fire would not.

She went a little farther, and she met some water. So she said, "Water!
water! quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick wont beat dog; dog
won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile, and I shan't get home
to-night." But the water would not.

She went a little farther, and she met an ox. So she said, "Ox! ox!
drink water; water won't quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick won't
beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile, and I
shan't get home to-night." But the ox would not.

She went a little farther, and she met a butcher. So she said, "Butcher!
butcher! kill ox; ox won't drink water; water won't quench fire; fire
won't burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't
get over the stile, and I shan't get home to-night." But the butcher
would not.

She went a little father, and she met a rope. So she said, "Rope! rope!
hang butcher; butcher won't kill ox; ox won't drink water; water won't
quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite
pig; piggy won't get over the stile, and I shan't get home to-night."
But the rope would not.

So she went a little farther, and she met a rat. So she said, "Rat!
rat! gnaw rope; rope won't hang butcher; butcher won't kill ox; ox won't
drink water; water won't quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick
won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile and I
shan't get home to-night." But the rat would not.

So she went a little farther, and she met a cat. So she said, "Cat! cat!
kill rat; rat won't gnaw rope; rope won't hang butcher; butcher won't
kill ox; ox won't drink water; water won't quench fire; fire won't burn
stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over
the stile, and I shan't get home to-night." But the cat said to her, "If
you will go to yonder cow and fetch me a saucer of milk, I will kill the
rat." So away went the old woman to the cow.

But the cow said to her, "If you will go to yonder haystack and fetch me
a handful of hay, I'll give you the milk." So away went the old woman to
the haystack; and she brought the hay to the cow.

As soon as the cow had eaten the hay she gave the old woman the milk,
and away she went with it in a saucer to the cat.

As soon as the cat had lapped up the milk, the cat began to kill the
rat; the rat began to gnaw the rope; the rope began to hang the butcher;
the butcher began to kill the ox; the ox began to drink the water; the
water began to quench the fire; the fire began to burn the stick; the
stick began to beat the dog; the dog began to bite the pig; the little
pig in a fright jumped over the stile; and so the old woman got home
that night.
